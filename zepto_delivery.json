i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more","1":"anybody who doesnt have a sister want one im up for sending rakhisvia zeptoswiggy or any quick delivery app just because im anxious to

zepto cafe","4":"","5":"","6":"one of my friends introduced me to their partner today they are running some kind of business the reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners\n\nthey set up a meeting at chaayos park square mall first a person came to meet meher partnerand explained that the senior partner a lady would come to meet me to see if i have the vision and mindset for the business and if im likeminded enough to partner\n\nthe lady boss came for a general introduction she didnt say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better she asked why i wanted to do business my plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life she responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere and i insisted on not missing the monetary benefits she asked why i hadnt started earlier and i said i didnt have a clear idea to start with and didnt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case then she talked about the mindset of zeptos founders a food delivery app and how they succeeded even after dropping out i called her out saying she was wrong and corrected her by saying zepto is a food delivery app she responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect\n\ni asked about the business and she said i wouldnt be able to fully understand it then she explained that they are in b2b ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to make my decision and have the money ready and once im in the business i would understand it fully she added that if it were on the internet or so public everyone would be doing this we are exclusive and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a partner we need to know each other and the business well i cant understand anything without being inside the business she said \n\nthis friend is more of an acquaintance and i dont know a lot about her how we met is an interesting story but it doesnt add any context here\n\nthe job requires 23 hours a day done digitally that friend bought a car recently and quit her fulltime job as well\n\nsounds like an mlm scheme or scam to me but is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it what is this business how does it operate is it legitimate\n\ni said no to join because i cant be part of anything i dont fully understand and its not public or on the internetanything protected and very private is a red flag for me and i cant put the money in it blindly\n\none more thing they kept calling each other sirmaam even though they are colleagues","7":"","8":"","10":"a deloitte report estimates indian quick commerce to be a massive 40 bn market by 2030 some dominant grocery delivery models in india\ud83d\udc47\n\nindias quick commerce landscape in 2024 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 the rapid growth seen in the quick commerce business has compelled zomato to double down on blinkit it is looking to nearly double its store count by the end of fy25 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 mukesh ambaniled ril is close to launching its own quick commerce operations through jiomart  looking to deliver groceries in select cities in under 30 minutes and is likely to ramp up operations by next year \n\n\ud83d\udd38 reliance reportedly plans to take it to around 1000 cities in future and jiomart will tap into reliance retails network of over 18000 stores across the country\n\n\ud83d\udd38 that kind of scale would allow jiomart to potentially catapult the existing group of quick commerce apps  blinkit swiggys instamart and zepto  and also end the nascent ambitions of tataowned bigbasket and flipkart before they take off\n\n\ud83d\udd38 flipkart is fresh with funds from google and majority stakeholder walmart and is also likely to make a major push for grocery delivery where blinkit zepto and swiggy have created welloiled playbooks","11":"seriously why ruin my mental health by having misgivings about the risedownfall of certain quick commerce companieswhether swiggyblinkit or zepto will ultimately become the market leader when i can just invest in a proxy company\n\nseeing the rise in quick commerce in india i decided to invest in a paper companywhich i will not name this is a multibagger in the makingfrom my pov  \n  \nyou know how you get your productsfood by an amazonswiggy delivery boy in a package right they supply this packaging paper and is a fundamentally strong companythe stock is also undervalued while these quick commerce companies fight tooth and nail for market share in this competitive industry pudumjee provides the supply of paper to carry out their deliveries which has resulted in an explosion in their their earnings\n\nthis post is not a recommendation to buy or sell its just to share the benefits of investing in proxy companies","12":"was indifferent at the start when zepto arrived in kochi and then they offered their pass at a few bucks worth a try right the rates were unbeatable their little brown bags were cute too till i had a pile of it here i dont need a bag enabled i found myself buying all groceries from them super quick deliveries \n\ntime for renewal of membership still some bucks  though technically it had tripled now i think prices were still low but higher than earlier deliveries still fast but slower than earlier the app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here not what you want to learn from your competition looking at you swiggy still good\n\nnow theyve gotten really sneaky with their pricing a few things are still on discounted rates but most arent but the real sneaky part is where they dont show the split of the prices anymore you need to go look for it and heres the best part you need to now enable free delivery sneaky buggers guess much like the other delivery apps this too will be just another option \n\ndont know if they would be able to sustain what are your thoughts and experiences with the app do you think itll be much like the countless food spots that pop up every other day and are gone in a few months here in kochi","13":"so recently i was wondering how quick commerce poses a threat to the kirana stores \n\nalthough the quick commerce is really convenient and swanky it has its downsides \n\n1 always pay 60 rupees extra on each order in the name of delivery fee convenience etc\n2 overspending on these apps to reach a minimum order value \n3 buying vegetables is a hassle here\n\nwhat if we had an option of getting a delivery within 15 mins of your groceries from the nearby kirana stores in a radius of 5km \n\n this increases the visibility of that store\n and removes the convenience charge for the consumer\n it also plays on the factor of trust where you buy stuff from your trusted kirana store near you\n\nhow to make money\n\n the consumer pays a monthly pass of 500 for using the platform with zero convenience fees and delivery charges\n the kirana stores pay a fee to use the platform \n\nis this something that would interest you","14":"hi guys\n\ni am launching a new venture to help d2c brands offer 3060 minute deliveries directly

scroll through the post and you will get it\n\n  \n  \nfirst of all if you want to get serious in life i have a lifechanging opportunity for you\n\nonly condition is are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent \n\n\n\nthis post could be the life changing for you might be long\n\n\n\nto give you some context \n\ni am an integral part of an amazing startup i wont name it here but i can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn to give you a brief idea about us we are a delivery startup \n\nyou might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories \n\n\n\nknows about native app development \n\nwell assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week if you complete it within the timeframe well start your stipend\n\n\n\ndoesnt know about app development \n\neven if you dont know anything about app development but youre a determined individual who wants to achieve something then you are welcome in our startup\n\nwe are ready to invest in you working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach youwithin a year of working with a startup you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nfor learning well first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 34 days if you show that youre a smart quick learner well start your stipend \n\nthis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\nthis opportunity is open to everyone even if youve just started your first year of college doesnt matter were looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work\n\n\n\nfuture plans \n\n\n\nif you stick with us well continue paying your stipend and once we have full confidence in your work after 46 months well hire you directly within a year you could be earning at least \n\n10

i tried contacting their customer support hoping for an easy refund i was ready for replacement as well but it seems like i have to beg just to get what i paid for\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences with zepto or other quick commerce platforms its frustrating that they promise quality and speed but if theres a problem theyre conveniently unavailable or dismissive why are these platforms allowed to operate this way it feels like theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service","37":"\n\nindias startup scene has shown that it can handle tough times even when the world economy slows down in 2024 india became the 4th biggest

deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating","39":"anyone had any luck with any of the quick delivery apps using their

tata neu plus now although direct upi from account is always the ultimate backup filled that upi rupay void with hdfc tata neu plus my first nonltf card but fyf still i know infinity is better but i

card bills across banks via dc this month till i find a better option in terms of privacy payment instrument acceptance and reliability i will stick to paytm  sbi dc as my default combo rewards from

as possible i prefer to avoid quick commerce  blinkit zepto bb and food deliveries  swiggy zomato and instead go for morningafternoon walks in the park and buy veggiesfruits along my back and whenever i am out at homestays prefer to walk down at least one side to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh this alone results in substantial savings no overpriced buyingconveniencedelivery

electronics gadgets appliances\n\nx200b\n\ncredit rating\n\ni have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a lucrative offer avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases of liabilities such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds andor settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs but not all of my wants\n\nx200b\n\nepilogue\n\ni still have mostly ltf cards i remember an amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews updates news hacks and what not for the current and future indian credit card holders i hope the community continues to blossom and i am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments","49":"\nbusiness

things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit. \n\nQuick commerce will stay for sure. The scale will vary.\nIt's plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit. Basically the DMart strategy but online\nYou\u2019d have said the same thing for Swiggy Zomato few years back. The idea is to get people so hooked to it, there\u2019s no other way. I\u2019m totally hooked and now don\u2019t schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means I\u2019d get used to not spending that extra time so I\u2019m sure even later I\u2019d be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 -2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues. \nAlso I don\u2019t think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper, they\u2019re infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nBlinkit does deliveries only within 2 Km from their stores and charge 21 Rs extra for it. It's definitely not free delivery.\nHere to stay, but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other channels, highly possible that we will see more logistics companies coming up soon to deliver locally for restaurants\/ mncs directly instead of working with Q commerce","1":"Mai hun behen mere pe bhi koi behen nii hai Resume ye hai\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ntf4uy6qnejd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df7ba99babbf1d9c87a80d8e6df585805866cb2b\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u1w3qzqtpejd1.jpeg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6887a9e177d345ee75f27946fdcdc068158b7e3f\nBeing a single child I know the pain , the feeling of fomo\n\nWill you be my sister dear stranger \ud83c\udf80![img](emote|t5_2qp7h|51074)\nWholesome comment section ![img](emote|t5_2qp7h|51074)\nThis sub never fails to make me smile lol.

Increasing house sales and infrastructures such as metro stations, hospitals, schools are the growth opportunities for this industry and company.\n\nBut the share price is not going up and instead steadily decreasing. Any ideas\/suggestions regarding what approach I should take here?\n\nI'm hoping for decent Q2 results so that the share price increases a little and at least does not fall further.","12":"I uninstalled Zepto for this very reason. It should be applied automatically.\nDark patterns these are called.\nHeard they are using kochi as some testing ground for their features as they are relatively new here and the user base is lower than other regions.\nI really reduce my dependance on online Grocery and food delivery apps as much as I can unless I am in a tight situation...\nEven though this didnot happen to me other than once,but the app is so laggy and smtimes the cart price and their price seems 10-20rs diff even making me count it manually","13":"I think this is how the idea of zepto began but doing this is not very efficient. They shifted to dark stores to improve that crazy level of efficiency and speed. And also I don't think they are charging incorrectly. They are giving you the service of delivering almost anything in 10 mins so don't you think that begets a bit of overhead cost.\nthought about this personally and i\u2019m sure a lot of other people have as well. the primary reason this doesn\u2019t work is inventory management. you can\u2019t track inventory at kirana stores all by yourself, and all the kirana stores not only track inventory in different ways but also they also don\u2019t all do it digitally. getting them to download, use and get accustomed to your platform - let alone pay for it, is a steep challenge in itself. not to mention doing that on scale. \n\nso showing inventory for different stores, on the app, having it updated at all times, is not something that\u2019s feasible imo. \n\nfor e.g. if i add a coke at 8 in the evening, but the store doesn\u2019t have it because it\u2019s out of coke, they can\u2019t send in the order and the app doesn\u2019t know they don\u2019t have coke. it\u2019s chaos all around.\n\nthat said, the opportunity is massive. the unorganised sector is huge and i\u2019m sure kirana stores in tier 1 at least are losing business. if you can solve for them, help them, make the app personal by putting faces and names of the \u2018uncles\u2019 sitting at the shop, it would be a unique personalised approach to make people feel like they aren\u2019t being robbed and they\u2019re being \u2018local\u2019 by ordering from their friendly neighbourhood kirana shop.\n\nsleep on it, do some primary research and if you find a solid solution, hit me up. would love to throw my hands on this one.\nThese downsides you've listed are a real stretch, and aren't really that much of a problem.\n\n- Zepto pass costs just 39 rupees a month. With that frankly ridiculously low fee, I get a lot of additional monthly discounts.\n\n- Delivery is free above 99 rupees, which you cross by adding just two or three items.\n\n- Not sure what problem you're hinting at when you're talking about ordering veggies and fruits. If you're talking about quality, you'll sometimes fave the same issues when your kirana or veggie vendor also deliver.\n\nThis post may sound like I'm a huge proponent of Zepto. I'm not. These guys are using VC monies to kill local businesses. It's unfair and predatory.\n\nBut most ppl don't care. You're getting anything you want within ten mins, and at great discounts.\n\nDig deeper here to find a more genuine insight.\nimo they are doing great . i just signed in as a delivery partner for fun to understand their working and to explore new places and meet new people it was great experience  and it was crazy people are ordering like hell. i stay in electronics city phase 1 and in night 12 to 2 am  order where more then day time .  is it good or bad ??  \nand the management at their store is next level they are doing really great in some parts of region\nachieving quick deliveries (under 15 mins) with a kirana store is next to impossible. Dark stores by these companies are efficient. Maybe this model can work with semi quick deliveries (under 90 mins maybe).","14":"[deleted]\nDM me\nHi, which city are you starting with and what products are you targeting?\nPlease tell me\nHey would love to get more information about this","15":"## If you are on Discord, please join our Discord server: [https:\/\/discord.gg\/Hg2H3TJJsd](https:\/\/discord.gg\/Hg2H3TJJsd)\n\nThank you for your submission to r\/BTechtards.

Direction API, distance matrix , geo coding, street view, map sdk, notification services...  Not  to forget aws\/azure services... List can go on..\n\nI serviced a small  uber like cab vendor from Guwahati. There modest google api services alone gets avg of 3-5L monthly.\nYa i understand about everything which you can manage.\n\nQuick commerce is all about timing...how you gonna deal with traffic...i mean flyovers are generally traffic free but then have only few access points...how you gonna make things work out\nIt's been a while since I too thought about quick ecommerce especially in Guwahati,the problem is that when big players like zepto, blinkit or Instamart enters Guwahati, you will cease to exist. Moreover it's not tech only, it's ops heavy. And building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party API costs would be huge and also I think you are familiar with their warehouse models too, so there's another huge expense tbh, so good luck.\n\nComing to tech part, it's not a single guy work (if it's gonna be in a small period of time), u need a proper team (atleast one senior guy and some devs) and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate, so initial funding is therefore needed. Anyways good luck on your journey and feel free to dm, I'm mostly in tech part anyways.\nthere are white-label food delivery apps that you can buy and customise\/rebrand to validate your idea and Product Market Fit.\n\nBut if you want to create a zeto\/blinkit level tech, you need much much more than a tech partner (think multiple engineering teams and loads of $$$)","17":"Thank you for your contribution to our subreddit.

Eventually they started chasing profit maximization and raised prices. Demand fell as people found themselves unable to afford the inventory. The large stores then were no longer needed and the brands realised it was not worth it to operate and started closing down these stores. Eventually, vaste swathes of urban centres in North America\/Europe and Australia often operate without any retail stores.

Such as select neighborhoods in Bangalore (Koramangala, HSR, Whitefield), Mumbai (anything south of Bandra), Hyderabad (Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Nanakramguda\/Financial District side), Gurugram (all sectors coming up along Golf Curse Road and Golf Course Extension Road). People will eventually end up paying a very high price for daily essentials. This will be tough for any pensioners or young professionals (who start on low pay-grades)\nI am not investor or banker. I am just a common citizen so take my word with a pinch of a salt, I know nothing about how capital market works.\n\nMy take about quick commerce companies is that those companies will vanish just quickly like they have popped up in next 5 to 10 years. Reason being that their business is not sustainable. Soon they will run out of their deep pocketed funds, they will decrease their discounts and eventually ordering from them will become a hassle. People will go back to old kirana stores (if any has left after so many years) once deep discounts are stopped.\nWhole valuation of startups now a days is based on fairy future which investors wants to see, They don't consider any hiccups at this point with quick commerce because it is flourishing well and giving new jobs to people (even at the cost of old ones).\nBut sooner of later whole growth will stablize at single decimal pct, why?\n1. After top 50-60 cities, market is no more viable and local commerce is very strong. Value of 10 Rs is more strong as you go to smaller cities. \n2. Local kirana store are also changing them selves though it is not visible because no one is writing a report about them. They are bringing more brands with home delivery. Saw that in Gurgaon in near by sectors and in Jaipur too. \n3. FMCG companies will not let General trade die so easily, they came earlier at same crossroads with Flipkart, Udaan but it is important for them to keep this part due to business need and govt may force them to do so indirectly. We saw this in electronics between 2013-16 but then companies started building their offlines channels again on similar footing. \n4. My father's generation likes social shopping, they go to market daily for all essential needs. I think i also don't want my child to just depend on e-commerce and surely will take him for more social shopping. This habit change is expected in every zepto user once they cross certain age limit.\n\nThey are many positives also in the favor of quick commerce specially like availability of items but do we need all these at 10 min?\nThey are **Whale of Instant Delivery**. They will die only if consumer decided not to use QC all together which is now impossible due to the habit formation. There was a foundational problem in Byju's, customer support, sales, and lot of trouble. Which I guess in Zepto's case you cant see these. There users keep going back to them.\n\nI have seen Zepto is next Byju's bla bla... Maybe its coz its rooted in us that if someone is making progress quickly then we have to go behind them. Just because they are growing rapidly does not mean they are going to fail. They have already overthrown Instamart from the 2nd place.\nThose guys are burning through $35**M** per month to just stay afloat \ud83d\ude02.

So, I run a marketing company, and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like Blinkit, instamart, Zepto, and all. Right now, they\u2019re spending lots of money on free deliveries, cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share. But once they start focusing on profits, will people actually continue using them?\n\nTake Zomato and Swiggy, for example\u2014they charge more than the restaurant prices. If these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores, do you think people will still buy from them? The convenience is great for emergencies\u2014but people are willing to pay extra for that every time?\n\nMost of us compare prices and love a good deal. If the discounts go away or things get too expensive, wouldn\u2019t a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets? Or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people won\u2019t mind paying for?\n\nCurious to know what you guys think\u2014are these apps here to stay, or is it just a phase until they stop being \"cheap\"?

","6":"Another BLR scam? One of my friends introduced me to their partner today (they are running some kind of business). The reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners.\n\nThey set up a meeting at Chaayos, Park Square Mall. First, a person came to meet me\u2014her partner\u2014and explained that the senior partner, a lady, would come to meet me to see if I have the vision and mindset for the business and if I\u2019m like-minded enough to partner.\n\nThe lady boss came for a general introduction. She didn\u2019t say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better. She asked why I wanted to do business. My plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life. She responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere, and I insisted on not missing the monetary benefits. She asked why I hadn\u2019t started earlier, and I said I didn\u2019t have a clear idea to start with and didn\u2019t want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case. Then she talked about the mindset of Zepto\u2019s founders, a food delivery app, and how they succeeded even after dropping out. I called her out, saying she was wrong, and corrected her by saying Zepto is a food delivery app. She responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect.\n\nI asked about the business, and she said I wouldn\u2019t be able to fully understand it. Then she explained that they are in B2B e-commerce. They would set up my virtual distributor shop, and I would get distributorship rights for big corporations, selling to retailers. I would have 10-14% margins shared with all the partners. They work in collaboration, so if any other partner makes a sale, I get my share. I would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop.\n\nThere are two requirements: I have to make a quick decision and invest 4.5 lakhs. That 4.5 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop.\n\nI asked follow-up questions, and she said she couldn\u2019t tell me more about the business. Once I say yes and share my documents for verification, she would tell me more, and I would need to have the money ready. She said that once I get into the business, I would fully understand it.\n\nI asked if I wanted to know more, is there a website or something I could read on. She said no, we are protected, and there is nothing on the internet. I asked her to send me at least some documents to read, and she said she had already told me everything required. She said I need to make my decision and have the money ready, and once I\u2019m in the business, I would understand it fully. She added that if it were on the internet or so public, everyone would be doing this. We are exclusive and protected.\n\nI had a heated discussion, and she left, asking me to make the decision and inform my friends. Then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner. I said that as a partner, we need to know each other and the business well. I can\u2019t understand anything without being inside the business, she said. \n\nThis friend is more of an acquaintance, and I don\u2019t know a lot about her. How we met is an interesting story, but it doesn\u2019t add any context here.\n\nThe job requires 2-3 hours a day, done digitally. That friend bought a car recently and quit her full-time job as well.\n\nSounds like an MLM scheme or scam to me. But is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it? What is this business, how does it operate? Is it legitimate?\n\nI said no to join because I can\u2019t be part of anything I don\u2019t fully understand, and it\u2019s not public or on the internet\u2014anything protected and very private is a red flag for me, and I can\u2019t put the money in it blindly.\n\nOne more thing, they kept calling each other sir\/ma\u2019am even though they are colleagues.","7":"[Business] - Rapido in talks with Zepto for quick commerce delivery | Times of India ","8":"[Business] - Rapido in talks with Zepto for quick commerce delivery ","10":"India\u2019s Grocery wars A Deloitte report estimates Indian quick commerce to be a massive $40 Bn market by 2030.

Looking at you Swiggy!) still good.\n\nNow, they've gotten really sneaky with their pricing. A few things are still on discounted rates but most aren't. But the real sneaky part is where they don't show the split of the prices anymore. You need to go look for it. And here's the best part, you need to now enable free delivery. Sneaky buggers.

(Yes, I am not kidding scroll through the post and you will get it)\n\n  \n  \nfirst of all, if you want to get serious in life. I have a life-changing opportunity for you\n\nOnly condition is: are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent? \n\n\n\nThis post could be the life changing for you. (might be long)\n\n\n\nTo give you some context, \n\nI am an integral part of an amazing startup (I won't name it here, but I can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn) to give you a brief idea about us, we are a delivery startup \n\nYou might think, \"bUt bRoO, tHeRE are already Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, in tHE sAmE business then what are you doing different \" but let me tell you, we have a completely different USP and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like Zomato & Swiggy. And even if they tried to copy us in the future, it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nEnough about our startup. Now, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s relevant to you.\n\n  \nFor our startup, we are building our app. We have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns. We recently secured funding and are looking to scale. We\u2019ve built Version 1 \n\nand launched it on the App Store and Play Store. We\u2019re now working on Version 2, and for that, we\u2019re looking for interns with experience in native app development. Don\u2019t close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development; bear with me, I have something for you :)\n\n\n\nJust let me clear it here : we don't give a single fuck about your CGPA. Excellence is what we are looking for. \n\n\n\nbut before starting out, I want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired. \n\n \n\n3 months ago, we hired 2 interns from one of the top college, both were girls. One had an impressive CV with crazy projects, languages, and all that, while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance, promising she wouldn\u2019t disappoint us. We hired both, and even while they were learning, we started their stipend. (how we searched for them? we circulated msg's on their whatsapp college groups) However, we noticed that the girl with the great CV was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it (Like literal laughable excuses) She was doing all the mediocre work nothing special, just the bare minimum(sometimes not even bare minimum) with delayed submissions and all.  \n   \nIn startups, things move fast, and you have to learn quickly and adapt. She wasn\u2019t doing that, but on top of that, she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend. On the other hand, the second girl, who asked for a chance, did extremely well.\n\n She put in the effort and did what was expected, staying on top of her tasks.\n\nA week ago, the first girl with the great CV sent us a message saying she couldn\u2019t continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for GATE at IIT. (It was all lie, like as usual) and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work. This whole situation was a lie. How did I know? Because previously she added me on LinkedIn, and yesterday, I saw her comment under a LinkedIn post asking for another internship, attaching her CV\n\n\n\nI won\u2019t comment further on her, but put yourself in my shoes. Imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return.\n\n\n\nSo, this is the exact type of person we don\u2019t want to hire. We really don\u2019t want any \u201cinternship farmers\u201d who aim to do 5-6 internships just to make their CVs shinner than the moon itself. \n\nIf that\u2019s your goal, we\u2019re not interested.\n\n\n\nWhat we want?\n\n\n\nWe want some smart Individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life. This doesn\u2019t have to be a project; we don\u2019t want another CV decorator who just wants to paint their dry CV with some internships. We want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return. \n\n\n\nThis is a paid internship.   \n\n\nPreviously, we offered no-conditions paid internships, but because of our past experience, we just don't want to burn our money.\n\n\n\nIf you reading this, you fall under 2 categories :\n\n\n\nKnows about Native app development :\n\nwe\u2019ll assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week. If you complete it within the timeframe, we\u2019ll start your stipend.\n\n\n\nDoesn't know about app development :\n\nEven if you don\u2019t know anything about app development, but you\u2019re a determined individual who wants to achieve something, then you are welcome in our startup.\n\nWe are ready to invest in you. working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach you.Within a year of working with a startup, you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nFor Learning, we\u2019ll first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 3-4 days. If you show that you\u2019re a smart, quick learner, we\u2019ll start your stipend. \n\nThis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis opportunity is open to everyone, even if you\u2019ve just started your first year of college. Doesn't matter. We\u2019re looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work.\n\n\n\nFuture plans :\n\n\n\nIf you stick with us: We\u2019ll continue paying your stipend, and once we have full confidence in your work after 4-6 months, we\u2019ll hire you directly. Within a year, you could be earning at least \n\n10 LPA, and if you show extraordinary skills, 15 LPA. I Know, Offering this package during this period of time of recession is rare, but we\u2019re committed.\n\n\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ready to join us, feel free to DM me. We\u2019ll set up a Google Meet and take it from there.\n\n","16":"QuickCommerce business in Guwahati, need tech partner.

Their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from \u20b977 crore to \u20b9250-300 crore. Yet investors have poured in $1.35 billion in 2024 alone. Why?\n\nThe answer lies in what they're really building: a massive consumer behavior database. Each dark store isn't just a warehouse - it's a data collection center tracking thousands of households' purchasing patterns, brand preferences, and price sensitivities.\n\nFMCG companies are noticing. Industry sources indicate major brands are creating Zepto-specific products and packages. The power dynamic is shifting - when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers, traditional retail relationships change.\n\nThe expansion raises questions. In Mumbai alone, over 200 local retail spaces now house Zepto's dark stores. Each requires specific zoning permissions, affecting local real estate markets. Meanwhile, internal documents mention development of \"back-end mother hubs\" automation systems, even as the company aggressively hires with above-market salaries.\n\nTheir \"SuperSaver\" feature requires minimum orders of \u20b9999 - a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior. Combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics, it suggests a broader plan for market control.\n\nThe environmental impact deserves scrutiny. With 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips, the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured.\n\nZepto promises an IPO within 24 months while planning major operational changes. Their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by March 2025. These timelines create interesting questions about their long-term strategy.\n\nWhat we're witnessing might be more than quick commerce. It's potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience. Every order, every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how India shops.\n\nThe implications warrant discussion. How will this affect local retail networks? What happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value? When does convenience become control?\n\nThese aren't hypothetical concerns. The next time your phone lights up with a Zepto notification, consider: You might be feeding data into a system that's fundamentally changing India's retail landscape, one 10-minute delivery at a time.","25":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Aug 19th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","26":" Zepto's Steel Deal Offer is Nice, but the App Needs Work! So, recently tried Zepto for the first time because of their Steel Deal offer for new users. I'l admit, the super-fast delivery was a nice surprise, and the referral bonuses make it worth a try if you're just getting started.\nThat said, the app still feels like it's missing a few basics. Sorting through items can be a bit clunky, and\nnoticed some essential products aren't even listed. It's great for quick deliveries, but feel like they could improve the variety and app organization to make it a smoother experience.\nAnyone else tried it? What do you think?","27":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Big basket\n\nThese were packed items, so quality would be same.","29":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0[r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/\/)\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics.

Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping.

A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

As per JM Financial, QC has grown nearly 10x in the last two years to about $3 billion in GMV. Expected to grow by 13x, reaching $40 billion in GMV by 2030.  \n  \nHere are some key developments happening in QC:1. Blinkit, the market leader, is expanding into Tier-2 cities.2. Flipkart has re-entered the QC space with its new \u2018Minutes\u2019 offering.3. Zepto raised nearly $1 billion in funding this year.  \n  \nQC companies are expanding into new categories, including restaurant food, fashion, and electronics.  \n  \nThe QC business model is straightforward: Revenue = GMV x Margin + Fees  \nGMV is growing as average order values increase with new categories and customer frequency rises as people become more comfortable with QC.Margins are improving with the introduction of private labels and newer brands that are willing to pay a premium.Fees are increasing through platform charges, advertising, and listing fees from brands.On the cost side, expenses like wastage, delivery, and warehousing are becoming more efficient and should decrease over time.","31":"Zepto is shit I had the most underwhelming experience at Zepto last night. I ordered some period care for my girlfriend and the order didn\u2019t get dispatched for over half and hour. And even after that the delivery guy wasn\u2019t interested in delivering it quickly. He probably walked to my place. ","32":"Shoudl we buy Swiggy in unlisted market?

Only 40% will be used by the company for it's operations.  \n  \nInformation 2: Swiggy reduced its losses to \u20b92,350 crore in FY 24, down 43% from last year.  \n  \nMeaning: It's a loss-making company and looks like it will continue to be making losses for some more time.  \n  \nInformation 3: \u20b9559.1 crore of the fresh issue will be used for setting up dark stores  \n  \nMeaning: It's betting big on quick commerce. As per THE KEN, Swiggy instamart is the slowest in delivery time and the average order value is almost the same as Zepto and BB Now. Blinkit is way ahead of it in all parameters. So somewhere needed there.  \n  \nSummary: Pre IPO investing is generally a difficult call. It's got a 50:50 chance. I am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets.  \n  \nIf you found this post useful, share it with your friend.","33":"Quick commerce apps?

So, I recently ordered some groceries from Zepto, because they have free delivery charges. But what I received was anything but fresh, several items were either rotten or close to it. I tried contacting their customer support, hoping for an easy refund, I was ready for replacement as well, but it seems like I have to beg just to get what I paid for.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences with Zepto or other quick commerce platforms? It\u2019s frustrating that they promise quality and speed, but if there\u2019s a problem, they\u2019re conveniently \u201cunavailable\u201d or dismissive. Why are these platforms allowed to operate this way? It feels like they\u2019re putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards.\n\nIs there any way to get them to take accountability. Or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service?","37":"India\u2019s startup boom despite global slowdown: Learnings from India\u2019s tech scenario in 2024 https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/omgh2g5giv0e1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a23e5e55b21a1d7c90605e625e83f548d4303a\n\nIndia\u2019s startup scene has shown that it can handle tough times even when the world economy slows down. In 2024, India became the 4th biggest tech hub in the world. While global markets have grappled with tighter financial conditions, India has weathered the storm, drawing on its innovative spirit and rapidly growing digital economy. Even though venture capital and private equity money dropped a bit \u2014 $7.6 billion in 2024 compared to $8.2 billion in 2023 \u2014 India still proves that it\u2019s a top spot for new ideas.\n\nThis article looks at how India\u2019s tech industry is going strong even when times are tough. It\u2019s getting a boost from growing areas like fintech, retail tech, and cleantech. Cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Gurugram still lead the way as crucibles of new ideas. We\u2019ll take a close look at Tracxn\u2019s 2024 India Tech Geo YTD Report and hear from industry experts, and learn about the trends, hurdles, and new chances that will shape the future of India\u2019s tech world.\n\n# India\u2019s tech world stays strong in 2024: Growing economy sparks new ideas\n\nAt the core of India\u2019s start-up success lies its strong economy, which will grow by 8.2 per cent in 2024, surpassing global growth rates. This economic strength has built a firm base for the country\u2019s growing tech scene, helping its start-ups to handle the financial troubles that have struck other big markets. India\u2019s dynamic business world, backed by its young and tech-smart people, has enabled it to deal with the global funding slowdown better than many other nations.\n\n# Investment trends and how decreased funding affects things\n\nEven though India\u2019s startup scene is still going strong, it took a hit with a 7 per cent drop in total funding \u2014 going from $8.2B in 2023 to $7.6B in 2024. This dip has led to a big change in where investors are putting their money. They\u2019re playing it safe now, giving $4.7 billion to more established companies. Meanwhile newer start-ups are feeling the pinch, with their funding taking a nosedive to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe global funding slowdown, which has an impact on geopolitical tensions and a tightening capital market, has pushed investors to focus on mature startups which have shown that they can scale. Pankaj Sharma CEO of Religare Finvest Ltd, contends, \u201cInvestors are drawn to companies that show openness, can adapt, and bounce back. This matters a lot in a shaky market where handling risks is key to growing in the long run.\u201d\n\n# Sectoral performance: Top performers and strugglers in 2024\n\n# Retail tech: Causing a revolution in customer experiences\n\nRetail tech stands out as one of India\u2019s top performers in 2024, pulling in $1.95 billion in funding \u2014 a 23 per cent jump from 2023. Flipkart and Meesho still lead the e-commerce scene, pushing growth through shopping experiences that use tech and cater to each person. Also, the boom in quick commerce has boosted companies like Zepto, which grabbed $665 million in funding this year. Zepto\u2019s super-fast grocery delivery shows how shoppers\u2019 wants to have changed, with speed and ease now being the key factors.\n\nRaja Singh Bhurji, CEO of The StepUp Ventures observes, \u201cBengaluru\u2019s mix of cultures, along with its global mindset, have helped start-ups to grow. The city\u2019s focus on learning and its pool of top talent allows start-ups to come up with new ideas and get more funding.\u201d Bengaluru\u2019s leading position in grabbing 35 per cent of the total funding in 2024, shows how much the city drives India\u2019s retail tech growth.\n\n# Fintech: Balancing new ideas and rules\n\nFintech has emerged as a key part of India\u2019s tech scene, attracting $1.49 billion in investments. The industry has seen quick digital uptake, pushed by offerings like digital fixed deposits (FDs), giving people new options to handle their money. Ravi Jain from Blostem thinks that the field\u2019s wins come from striking a balance between following rules and pushing tech forward. \u201cWe talk to regulators which lets us lead in new ideas while making sure that our products meet the criteria of the changing rules,\u201d he says.\n\n# Cleantech: The future of sustainability and electric mobility\n\nIndia\u2019s goal to reach Net-Zero emissions by 2070 has made cleantech a fast-growing industry, but it still faces big challenges. Pritesh Talwar, President of Lectrix EV, asserts, \u201cThe cleantech industry is still new in India, and scaling solutions like electric vehicles comes with issues such as high initial costs and worries about running out of power. However, these problems also create chances to come up with new ideas.\u201d Lectrix EV\u2019s Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) model is one such new idea, which has cut the cost of owning an electric two-wheeler (E2W) a lot by offering flexible leasing and swapping options.\n\nLectrix EV aims to create a lasting ecosystem, not just electric vehicles. They\u2019ve set up 250 battery swap stations in Delhi and want to add 400 more throughout India. This network has strategic placements to lessen range anxiety, which stops many people from buying EVs.\n\n# Aerospace and defence: Public-private partnerships and emerging technologies\n\nIndia\u2019s aerospace & defence sector is changing. Public-private partnerships and a focus on self-reliance are driving this change. The Make in India programme has pushed for more domestic production. Simultaneously, AI and robotics advances are reshaping our defence capabilities. Kiran Rudrappa, CEO of Posspole, says: \u201cThe government\u2019s Strategic Partnership model and public-private collaborations are critical for driving innovation in the aerospace sector. AI and robotics are key to enhancing India\u2019s defence efficiency.\u201d Yet, the sector still faces money problems. Companies are now looking to use government plans like iDEX to back new ideas.\n\nRead the full article:\u00a0[https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/](https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/)","38":"Zepto: High Time For You To Turn Ethical This experience is a culmination of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by Zepto (as a quick-commerce provider) operating in Sarjapur Road locality here in Bengaluru in particular and across India in general. Zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service; however, it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least. One day it is poor Quality Control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies \/ fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 15-20 mins minimum to even reach your community \/ apartment even during non-peak hours. Their Customer Support Team does not have any empathy to begin with. They tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie Customer Support Associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced Customer Support Associate who will start a seemingly never-ending saga of questions and unnecessary cross-checks with their internal logistics and quality control teams - all when you are still on chat with them. The whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on Zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 30-45 minutes in trying to relay their concerns and\/or reach a closure. I also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code \u201cFree Delivery\u201d before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have Zepto membership or not. One has to wonder as to why so forward-thinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such tech-savvy quick commerce apps COULD NOT apply a simple auto-logic to apply \u201cFree Delivery\u201d as and when a customer or patron\u2019s cart value reaches minimum order value by default. These practices not only expose Zepto\u2019s dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers\u2019 money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value. Zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers\u2019 hard-earned money using cheap con tricks. This is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating!!!\n\nHope this effort to expose Zepto and its greedy intentions create some much-needed noise and uproar amongst Zepto\u2019s senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\u2026\n\n  #TimeToChangeZepto #StopCheating","39":"Blinkit\/Zepto\/BigBasket using NRI number? Anyone had any luck with any of the quick delivery apps using their individual NRI numbers? ","40":"Starting to see the end of affordable grocery delivery apps? Came on here after hearing and seeing Zepto's plan to become profitable. I'm starting to see rs. 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members. This could be across India, but I'm seeing it already here in Bengaluru where lots of people order groceries. Even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs. 599 which isn't something I'll be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase. Seems to me that if this starts making them enough money, other apps will follow. Zepto is currently the only one without big backing - blinkit has zomato, bigbasket has tata, instamart has swiggy, and milkbasket has reliance, and they're facing difficulty in getting funding, but seems to me like I'd rather go to a grocery store now, where I can get better discounts, which I've been doing since they've started rolling this out. \n\nIs it just me? Or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes? Is the market too saturated with choices? \n\nWhat do you all think? How popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here? \n\nEdit: I was born and brought up in Bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown. For urgent needs I've always gone to the local store next to my apartment, or other stores nearby. However, when I'm coming back home late at night after work around 9-10, I've been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like Zepto. I'm saying it's a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible. That's what I meant. ","41":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","42":"What\u2019s next for this high-flying startup? Is Zepto about to set a stage for the next big thing in e-commerce? What started as a daring idea during the pandemic by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra quickly turned into a major player, hitting unicorn status in record time and is now leading the charge in quick delivery.\n\nWith this new funding, Zepto is set to expand even more. And there\u2019s talk about an IPO coming up soon. ","44":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 19th, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n\n\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) on the r\/ecommerce subreddit for a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Join free at www.shopifreaks.com","45":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","49":"News Headlines from Business News Agencies:* \n*Business Standard*\n\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udcdd Govt launches 2nd round of critical, strategic mineral blocks auction\n\ud83d\udcdd Key infra sectors' growth slows to 15-month low of 3.6% in January\n\ud83d\udcdd Fiscal deficit at Jan-end touches 63.6% of full year target: Govt data\n\ud83d\udcdd Cabinet approves setting up of three semiconductor plants in India\n\ud83d\udcdd SoftBank Group sells another 2% stake in crisis-hit Paytm to under 3%\n\ud83d\udcdd Sebi moves to restrict inflows into small- and mid-cap mutual funds\n\ud83d\udcdd Bitcoin nears $64,000, experts say it may beat previous high before halving\n\ud83d\udcdd India's green hydrogen sector will need $4-12 billion support: A&M report\n\ud83d\udcdd OnlyFans paid $15 billion to its creators since launch in 2016: CEO Blair\n\ud83d\udcdd Zepto launches loyalty programme offering free delivery, discounts\n\ud83d\udcdd PepsiCo India looking to capture bigger share of potato-based chips market\n\ud83d\udcdd Urban Indians ready to pay premium price for quick delivery: PwC report\n\n*Economic Times*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Positive economic outlook prevails for India's mid-market businesses despite global slowdown\n\ud83d\udcdd Statistics Ministry ties up with ISRO to conduct Urban Frame Survey in digital mode\n\ud83d\udcdd EV product pipeline, focus on volumes make Castrol India ripe for new highs\n\ud83d\udcdd Kotak Mahindra Bank aims to grow gold loan book faster than the industry\n\ud83d\udcdd Convergent, Samara Capital to acquire 51.8% in Agro Tech Foods\n\ud83d\udcdd India, US agree to share more information to curb illegal opioid trade\n\ud83d\udcdd US healthcare providers hit by frozen payments in ransomware outage\n\ud83d\udcdd Govt has built 95,000 km of national highways in last 10 years: Road secretary Anurag Jain\n\ud83d\udcdd DGCA issues stricter breath analyser norms for air traffic controllers, others\n\ud83d\udcdd NHAI gives one-month extension to FASTag users to comply with the KYC norms\n\ud83d\udcdd Puma launches 100 million euro share buyback programme\n\n*Mint*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd India's Q3 GDP grows at 8.4%; FY24 growth pegged at 7.6%\n\ud83d\udcdd Cabinet approves \u20b975,000 cr rooftop solar scheme\n\ud83d\udcdd Setback for Vedanta as SC dismisses plea to reopen Sterlite plant in Tamil Nadu\n\ud83d\udcdd Cabinet approves \u20b924,420 crore fertilizer subsidy for 2024 kharif season\n\ud83d\udcdd NCLT defers Go First insolvency decision, awaits high court order\n\ud83d\udcdd Cabinet approves PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana; to benefit 1 crore families\n\ud83d\udcdd EU consumers challenge Meta paid service as privacy \u2018smokescreen\u2019\n\ud83d\udcdd FAA gives Boeing 90 days to come up with quality-control plan\n\ud83d\udcdd US-based video game co Electronic Arts to slash 5% of its workforce\n\ud83d\udcdd Reliance exploring deal to bring British retailer Primark to India, says report\n\ud83d\udcdd SEC investigating whether OpenAI investors were misled\n\ud83d\udcdd ReNew in talks with Singapore\u2019s Sembcorp to sell 350 MW solar projects\n\ud83d\udcdd Semicon is the new oil, India should give more sops for fab units: Qualcomm\n","50":"Ordered from Zepto after 1 am, got chased by robbers (?) after delivery person called.

You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. They are very clever to ensure that the phones time is not visible when you are on the app but I can assure you both.

instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free

she didnt say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better she asked why i wanted to do business my plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life she responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere and i insisted on not missing the monetary benefits she asked why i hadnt started earlier and i said i didnt have a clear idea to start with and didnt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case then she talked about the mindset of zeptos founders a food delivery app and how they succeeded even after dropping out i called her out saying she was wrong and corrected her by saying zepto is a food delivery app she responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect\n\ni asked about the business and she said i wouldnt be able to fully understand it then she explained that they are in b2b ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to

and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a

it had tripled now i think prices were still low but higher than earlier deliveries still fast but slower than earlier the app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here not what you want to learn from your competition looking at you swiggy still good\n\nnow theyve gotten really sneaky with their pricing a few things are still on discounted rates but most arent but the real sneaky part is where they dont show the split of the prices anymore you need to go look for it and heres the best part you need to now enable free delivery sneaky buggers guess much like the other delivery apps this too will be just another option \n\ndont know if they would be able to sustain what are your thoughts and experiences with the app do you think itll be much like the countless food spots that pop up every other day and are gone in a few months here in kochi i uninstalled zepto for this very reason it should be applied automatically\ndark patterns these are called\nheard they are using kochi as some testing ground for their features as they are relatively new here and the user base is lower than other regions\ni really reduce my dependance on online

really convenient and swanky it has its downsides \n\n1 always pay 60 rupees extra on each order in the name of delivery fee convenience etc\n2 overspending on these apps to reach a minimum order value \n3 buying vegetables is a hassle here\n\nwhat if we had an option of getting a delivery within 15 mins of your groceries from the nearby kirana stores in a radius of 5km \n\n this increases the visibility of that store\n and removes the convenience charge for the consumer\n it also plays on the factor of trust where you buy stuff from your trusted kirana store near you\n\nhow to make money\n\n the consumer pays a monthly pass of 500 for using the platform with zero convenience fees and delivery charges\n the kirana stores pay a fee to use the platform \n\nis this something that would interest you i think this is how the idea of zepto began but doing this is not very efficient they shifted to dark stores to improve that crazy level of efficiency and speed and also i dont think they are charging incorrectly they are giving you the service of delivering almost anything in 10 mins so dont you think that begets a bit of overhead cost\nthought about this personally and im sure a lot of other people have as well the primary reason this doesnt work is inventory management you cant track inventory at kirana stores all by yourself and all the kirana stores not only track inventory in different ways but also they also dont all do it digitally getting them to download use and get accustomed to your platform  let alone pay for it is a steep challenge in itself not to mention doing that on scale \n\nso showing inventory for different stores on the app having it updated at all times is not something thats feasible imo \n\nfor eg if i add a coke at 8 in the evening but the store doesnt have it because its out of coke they cant send in the order and the app doesnt know they dont have coke its chaos all around\n\nthat said the opportunity is massive the unorganised sector is huge and im sure kirana stores in tier 1 at least are losing business if you can solve for them help them make the app personal by putting faces and names of the uncles sitting at the shop it would be a unique personalised approach to make people feel like they arent being robbed and theyre being local by ordering from their friendly neighbourhood kirana shop\n\nsleep on it do some primary research and if you find a solid solution hit me up would love to throw my hands on this one\nthese downsides youve listed are a real stretch and arent really that much of a problem\n\n zepto pass costs just 39 rupees a month with that frankly ridiculously low fee i get a lot of additional monthly discounts\n\n delivery is free above 99 rupees which you cross by adding just two or three items\n\n not sure what problem youre hinting at when youre talking about ordering veggies and fruits if youre talking about quality youll sometimes fave the same issues when your kirana or veggie vendor also deliver\n\nthis post may sound like im a huge proponent of zepto im not these guys are using vc monies to kill local businesses its unfair and predatory\n\nbut most ppl dont care youre getting anything you want within ten mins and at great discounts\n\ndig deeper here to find a more genuine insight\nimo they are doing great  i just signed in as a delivery partner for fun to understand their working and to explore new places and meet new people it was great experience  and it was crazy people are ordering like hell i stay in electronics city phase 1 and in night 12 to 2 am  order where more then day time   is it good or bad   \nand the management at their store is next level they are doing really great in some parts of region\nachieving quick deliveries under 15 mins with a kirana store is next to impossible dark stores by these companies are efficient maybe this model can work with semi quick deliveries under 90 mins maybe","14":"starting my new venture that

not kidding scroll through the post and you will get it\n\n  \n  \nfirst of all if you want to get serious in life i have a lifechanging opportunity for you\n\nonly condition is are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent \n\n\n\nthis post could be the life changing for you might be long\n\n\n\nto give you some context \n\ni am an integral part of an amazing startup i wont name it here but i can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn to give you a brief idea about us we are a delivery startup \n\nyou might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories \n\n\n\nknows about native app development \n\nwell assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week if you complete it within the timeframe well start your stipend\n\n\n\ndoesnt know about app development \n\neven if you dont know anything about app development but youre a determined individual who wants to achieve something then you are welcome in our startup\n\nwe are ready to invest in you working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach youwithin a year of working with a startup you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nfor learning well first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 34 days if you show that youre a smart quick learner well start your stipend \n\nthis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\nthis opportunity is open to everyone even if youve just started your first year of college doesnt matter were looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work\n\n\n\nfuture plans

moreover its not tech only its ops heavy and building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party api costs would be huge and also i think you are familiar with their warehouse models too so theres another huge expense tbh so good luck\n\ncoming to tech part its not a single guy work if its gonna be in a small period of time u need a proper team atleast one senior guy and some devs and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate so initial funding is therefore needed anyways good luck on your journey and feel free to dm im

amount of close calls when a two wheeler tried to cut lanes overtake from the left when im taking a left and even in general and a bunch more \n\ntoday sht hit the fan \n\nim taking a turn to come out on the main road did the usual  signal see left and right do a soft honk  you get it \n\ni start taking the turn and a speeding zepto driver ramms into my car \n\nfrom the looks of it the guy was driving at 40 kmph didnt even bother to slow down near a turn \n\nby the time i was leaving the car the guy said something and drove off \n\nat this point im just fed up of the drivers on yulus and bikes racing around the city \n\ni also recognise they have to meet the 10 min delivery promise from these quick commerce companies \n\nnow im spending my weekend trying to get my car sorted \n\nhow do you generally deal with these \n\nedit the rod attached to the wheel is bent i just hope this doesnt cost an arm and a leg to fix\n\nfolks from zepto called me to request details on the driver i told them i didnt have any \n\nim trying to get a cctv recording from a nearby shop  similar thing happened to me cant do anything about them they dont have the time to argue neither do we luckily not much damage happened in my case driving in bangalore rises bp fs\ntoday a fkr stopped in the middle of the road literally blocking 2 lanes pulled out his phone and started typing something the amount of dumb fks on our roads is terrifying\nhappened with me twice when a delivery guy on two wheeler and an auto overtook from left when there was hardly any space in the first case i came very close to hitting an suv to avoid collision with the two wheeler now i simply close the gap while approaching a turn to eliminate any possibility of such stunts by stupid drivers\nearlier bull guards helped save bumbers now since government has banned them they easily get damaged by two wheelers\n2 wheelers suddenly overtaking from the left are a big menace you just start sliding left or slide a but to avoid something on the right and out of nowhere one of them would narrowly miss you and then angrily stare at you like its your fault","20":"40 tax not swiggy but similar tactics everywhere  note so i noticed this on zepto but ive seen similar charges on all quick commerce apps just using it for reference here\n\nso i added 2 items to my cart one for 170 and the other for 100 so the total is 270 now these are already mrp items so the tax is include\n\nthe app added a handling fee  1 tobacco product convenience fee and delivery fee of 999 19 and 27 respectively which are all understandable\n\nwhat i dont understand is that gst and cess on handling is 4 4004 and on delivery is 1082 4007 respectively last i remember the maximum highest gst was 28 how are they charging approximately 40\n\nalso i noticed although i have zepto pass the free delivery isnt auto applied you have to manually apply it the only thing i hate is\nto have to click on apply to unlock free delivery like bitch who wants to click everyone wants free delivery\nsomewhere we allowed these food delivery appsknowingly or unknowingly to loot us we all became dependent on these apps and somehow we gave them the power and now theyre making profits  with all the access\n1082 is 18 on 56 482 i dont know maybe someone else can shed a light\ngst is 18 balance may be cess due to tobacco\nmany products like sugary carbonated beverages attract a gst of 28 plus 12 cess adding up to 40 your rationale that the maximum gst in india is 28 is wrong","21":"what are the most population dense regions

sorry for off topic but i wanted to share this i usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy this incident made me reconsider my thoughts\n\ni typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab since its raining in bengaluru i need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else i would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella\n\n the concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up\n\nits the after sales support im worried about no checking or returns at doorstep selling old expired or near expiry items returned and repackaged or seal broken and used items irresponsible customer care agents\n\nthats sorta things\neverything is worth it if you have money and people like those on this sub often can trade money for convenience\nwell of course billions of dollars are being poured by vcs into this industry theyre not fools to be so bullish on this for no reason \n\nside note how are you able to walk the distance thats equivalent to almost 300 cab fare\nyeah we had a 40hour power outage here because of the cyclone so i ordered a power bank from instamart with extra discount and 10 cashback

about how indias newest unicorn is reshaping retail through data\n\nzeptos growth is undeniable from 50 dark stores in 2021 to over 750 today with plans for 1200 by march 2025 their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from 77 crore to 250300 crore yet investors have poured in 135 billion in 2024 alone why\n\nthe answer lies in what theyre really building a massive consumer behavior database each dark store isnt just a warehouse  its a data collection center tracking thousands of households purchasing patterns brand preferences and price sensitivities\n\nfmcg companies are noticing industry sources indicate major brands are creating zeptospecific products and packages the power dynamic is shifting  when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers traditional retail relationships change\n\nthe expansion raises questions in mumbai alone over 200 local retail spaces now house zeptos dark stores each requires specific zoning permissions affecting local real estate markets meanwhile internal documents mention development of backend mother hubs automation systems even as the company aggressively hires with abovemarket salaries\n\ntheir supersaver feature requires minimum orders of 999  a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics it suggests a broader plan for market control\n\nthe environmental impact deserves scrutiny with 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured\n\nzepto promises an ipo within 24 months while planning major operational changes their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by march 2025 these timelines create interesting questions about their longterm strategy\n\nwhat were witnessing might be more than quick commerce its potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience every order every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how india shops\n\nthe implications warrant discussion how will this affect local retail networks what happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value when does convenience become control\n\nthese arent hypothetical concerns the next time your phone lights up with a zepto notification consider you might be feeding data into a system thats fundamentally changing indias retail landscape one 10minute delivery at a time i bet even dunzo had all these hopes and dreams\ngroupon zynga mayfair blue apron grubhub pandora casper warby parker allbirds all these companies had the same idea of being data driven which is absolutely bullshit \n\nyou could argue that amazon which has a gmv of about 18b in india has far more datapoints on people and pincodes yet they fail to improve their aov in india companies like flipkart myntra and others likely have datasets similar to amazons the pincodelevel data or purchasing patterns arent necessarily a competitive advantage because they are accessible or can be inferred by others","25":"ecommerce industry news recap

also introduced a cashback rewards program where customers can earn up to 10 cash back when using the klarna app to shop at participating retailers in europe klarna already has a banking license has offered similar services in germany since 2021 and is now expanding itll offer customers interest rates as high as 358 for savings in the us klarna doesnt have a banking license and is operating through partner banks its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the us as the money held isnt protected by the fdic there is also no interest offered to us customers\n\ntiktok users in the us who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to 300 in discounts or a 100 amazon gift card for every new creator they refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for thirdparty messaging apps like whatsapp to share and discuss videos\n\nftc announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase the new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators the rules prohibit fake consumer reviews buying or selling reviews insider reviews misrepresentation of companycontrolled review websites and review suppression ftc chair lina khan wrote fake reviews not only waste peoples time and money but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors by strengthening the ftcs toolkit to fight deceptive advertising the final rule will protect americans from getting cheated put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice and promote markets that are fair honest and competitive see my other post in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules \n\nsoundcloud launched a merch marketplace called soundcloud store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch the first edition of the store features designs from wiz khalifa denzel curry wolfacejoeyy bktherula armani white and other people ive never heard of before the artist submits a design soundcloud creates mockups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its soundcloud store from there soundcloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch the service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100 of the profits from sales \n\namazon is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products either that or amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake  paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them amazon told fortune that the limited test only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages \n\nx is closing its operations in brazil but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being according to a post from its globalaffairs account which wrote last night alexandre de moraes threatened our legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in brazil rather than respect the law or due process as a result to protect the safety of our staff we have made the decision to close our operation in brazil effective immediately\n\ntiktok is urging a federal appellate court in washington dc to block the protecting americans from foreign adversary controlled applications act which will effectively ban tiktok if its owner bytedance doesnt divest the app to an americanowned company by april tiktok calls the statute the most sweeping speech restriction in this countrys history and claims that it singles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million americans in its new filing last thursday tiktoks legal team claimed that the us is illegally singling out tiktok and that the governments fears are speculative and lack hard evidence the justice departments legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information and the doj has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a top secret classified designation\n\nnood an american bra brand known for its adhesive bras nipple covers and boob tape is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature indecent or inappropriate which has resulted in censorship shadow bans and removal of their advertisements this ones tough to judge on one hand i understand where nood is coming from just because their products are made for womens breasts doesnt intrinsically make their products sexual in nature on the other hand some of noods ads are objectively sexualized designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless only to look closer and discover that shes wearing a skin tone nipple cover many users wouldnt consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds and platforms have a responsibility to their users and other advertisers to only show content that adheres to their community

several items were either rotten or close to it i tried contacting their customer support hoping for an easy refund i was ready for replacement as well but it seems like i have to beg just to get what i paid for\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences with zepto or other quick commerce platforms its frustrating that they promise quality and speed but if theres a problem theyre conveniently unavailable or dismissive why are these platforms allowed to operate this way it feels like theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service india has such a large population that hitting the ceiling on consumer signup takes years probably which gives them enough confidence to not bother about consumers experience\nonce i was ordering few items like milkcurd and some biscuits and some ten chocolate breads like a loaf or something and it all came upto just 70 bucks or something at first i didnt think anything of itbut when i received the package all the items except the milk and the curd were due to expire the next day i immediately reached out and

unfulfilled deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating had very similar experiences with zepto instamart blinkit etc similar locality\n\nwe were wasting so much time in finding the right product across apps talking to their disinterested support team when quality wasnt good which was most of the time lately and we were throwing away a considerable portion of fresh vegetables and fruits due to bad quality\n\nsince the last few weeks we have gone back to simpler times visiting a super market once or twice a week 2 hrs of effort each week also you should compare the pricing we are saving 810k a month decent side benefit in my opinion","39":"blinkitzeptobigbasket using nri number anyone had any luck with any of the quick delivery apps using their individual nri numbers  do these apps support international numbers if yes you can login and place orders just mention an indian number in the comments for them to contact those living at your address in case they need something","40":"starting to see the end of affordable grocery delivery apps came on here after hearing and seeing zeptos plan to become profitable im starting to see rs 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members this could be across india but im seeing it already here in bengaluru where lots of people order groceries even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs 599 which isnt something ill be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase seems to me that if this starts making them enough money other apps will follow zepto is currently the only one without big backing  blinkit has zomato bigbasket has tata instamart has swiggy and milkbasket has reliance and theyre facing difficulty in getting funding but seems to me like id rather go to a grocery store now where i can get better discounts which ive been doing since theyve started rolling this out \n\nis it just me or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes is the market too saturated with choices \n\nwhat do you all think how popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here \n\nedit i was born and brought up in bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown for urgent needs ive always gone to the local store next to my apartment or other stores nearby however when im coming back home late at night after work around 910 ive been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like zepto im saying its a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy zepto was making losses and they were burning vc pe money\n\nbut that era is coming to an end\n\nit is never possible to deliver at the costs they did earlier forgot profits extreme losses but they had backing of vc pe money\n\nthat money is drying out fast\ni agree for small purchases now ive gone back to visiting local shops and buying from there not gonna pay 2x the orders cost in delivery fees and platform fees and whatnot","41":"ecommerce industry news

the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why

conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those

suvidha my expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash the ubiquitousness of pos upi acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to covid and demonetization and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow 5 years got onecard sapphiro as ltf added dcb and magnus to the portfolio got icici amazon pay for free prime membership and benefits then caught ltf hysteria from this sub and added au bank ixigio indusind legend and idfc first wow to my portfolio got kotak league hoping to use it for my upi rupay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card havent been able to set my upi pin still due to their backend issues will patiently wait as it is ltf and only as backup for tata neu plus now although direct upi from account is always the ultimate backup filled that upi rupay void with hdfc tata neu plus my first nonltf card but fyf still i know infinity is better but i am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity\n\nx200b\n\ncredit card bill payments\n\ni am still experimenting here for now with my debit cards axis citi sbi to see which is providing the best net cash conversion from app perspective payments made via paytm have been swift so far though it allows only sbi dc since axis and citi are both mastercard payzapp allows all my dcs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever i have tried this route i am thinking of trying out axis or hdfc native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via dc this month till i find a better option in terms of privacy payment instrument acceptance and reliability i will stick to paytm  sbi dc as my default combo rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria i will settle once i have optimized my dc rewards i have never used cred cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues\n\nx200b\n\nlifestyle expenses\n\nalmost two domestic flights every month homestay bookings prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day as much as possible i prefer to avoid quick commerce  blinkit zepto bb and food deliveries  swiggy zomato and instead go for morningafternoon walks in the park and buy veggiesfruits along my back and whenever i am out at homestays prefer to walk down at least one side to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh this alone results in substantial savings no overpriced buyingconveniencedelivery fees enforces me to remain in shape no need to pay for gym memberships and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle no need to take in vitamin d health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls  much more than any credit card rewards program can offer occoasional fine dining with family 24 times a month  gift cards weekend dining acceleration payment offers on eazydiner zomato dineout usually come in handy shopping on apparels  once or twice a year major family trips  only dometic till now probably once a year along with 23 minor ones to driveable distances may target for a family international trip this calendar year  only if i achieve my investment milestone that i am working upon term health insurance movie theatres  barely 4 in an year  only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over ott other things include  utility fuel autocab big ticket purchases  occasional over some years not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics gadgets appliances\n\nx200b\n\ncredit rating\n\ni have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a lucrative offer avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases of liabilities such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds andor settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs but not all of my wants\n\nx200b\n\nepilogue\n\ni still have mostly ltf cards i remember an amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews updates news hacks and what not for the current and future indian credit card holders i hope the community continues to blossom and i am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments man og citi was great bank  sad they left\nas you have so many ltfs which all banks have tried to charge some random fee fine\nwanna swap cards lol","49":"news headlines from business news agencies \nbusiness standard\n\u00a0 \n\ud83d\udcdd govt launches 2nd round of

its amazon flipkart zepto zomato swiggy blinkit or big basket etc\n\nthese companies dont do any background verification and having criminal record will not stop anyone from getting employeed as a delivery guy so always be careful about these people\n\npoverty is often romanticised on internet portraying these people as honest but in reality they are often involved in crime regularly they steal cloths hanging on rope shoes inside apartment some of them work as as delivery boys during day and do robbery at same houses at night after doing reece during delivery job \n\ni am sorry to hear

cafe\n\nit was very cold 10 degrees and he was standing still with eerie silence there were quite a few people inside this cafe of the same age as that of the delivery guy and they were partying playing snooker and drinking coffee right in front of that window opening\n\nhe must have completed his last deliveries nearby as his electric scooter was parked nearby i passed just next to him and he didnt even flinch or even notice\n\nthere was music and noise coming from inside of the cafe but there was absolute silence outside where he was standing\n\nreminds me to stay humble and appreciate little things in life hope i stay grateful for the things this universe has provided me\n\ni hope he gets to visit this cafe someday with his friends if he has any and enjoy a good day there \n\nps i couldnt do anything to help him im a student and hes better off earning by working hard as delivery person so theres nothing i could have really done its crazy how many of us take things for granted whether its money relationships or anything else gratitude is what we need because there is always someone else praying for the life we already have we have food clothes a house to live in while a homeless person is sleeping under a bridge with an empty stomach\n\ngratitude people gratitude\na punch of motivation for me whenever i feel low i remember \n\n\napna hi dukh dekha hai tumne\nbot kam

these are private companies stop treating them as if they have some public service responsibility they dont their objective is to make the highest revenue over the lowest expense\nif you have any issues with them charging stop using their service\nive seen this a lot of time please know this before posting it here everything is cost for your laziness\nbecause they can\nsmall cart fee is for when they wont break even for the dark store and its employees packing your order  \na higher cart value would cover the packing charges supermarkets that do home delivery of groceries over phone callwhatsapp wont take orders for less than 500rs because it should cover packing and delivery charges  \n\ndelivery charges are for the delivery service\nactually they cant charge a huge amount collectively so they divided it into parts \nfor customers satisfaction \ud83d\ude09","57":"zepto  a whale of instant delivery in making or a byjus of instadelivery ecosystem in making  why is zepto valued that high  reminds of the time  when byjus was also valued at 22b  today the reality is different \nof course comparing apples to oranges is a bad thing but is zepto really that reliable  is it overhyped a push from investors who over valued  or is it really solving something at core  \n\nnovice here no hate just asking what it felt  we should look at what happened to mom and pop retail in the useurope and to some extent in australia\n\nbig retail and ecommerce entered cities and towns and undercut mom and pop shops forcing them to close down eventually they started chasing profit maximization and raised prices demand fell as people found themselves unable to afford the inventory the large stores then were no longer needed and the brands realised it was not worth it to operate and started closing down these stores eventually vaste swathes of urban centres in north americaeurope and australia often operate without any retail stores these are called food desertsretail deserts and this phenomenon is now being studied extensively\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\ni fear similar thing might happen in a lot of tier 1 and 2 cities here especially places with high rentals such as select neighborhoods in bangalore koramangala hsr whitefield mumbai anything south of bandra hyderabad jubilee hills madhapur and nanakramgudafinancial district side gurugram all sectors coming up along golf curse road and golf course extension road people will eventually end up paying a very high price for daily essentials this will be tough for any pensioners or young professionals who start on low paygrades\ni am not investor or banker i am just a common citizen so take my word with a pinch of a salt i know nothing about how capital market works\n\nmy take about quick commerce companies is that those companies will vanish just quickly like they have popped up in next 5 to 10 years reason being that their business is not sustainable soon they will run out of their deep pocketed funds they will decrease their discounts and eventually ordering from them will become a hassle people will go back to old kirana stores if any has left after so many years once deep discounts are stopped\nwhole valuation of startups now a days is based on fairy future which investors wants to see they dont consider any hiccups at this point with quick commerce because it is flourishing well and giving new jobs to people even at the cost of old ones\nbut sooner of later whole growth will stablize at single decimal pct why\n1 after top 5060 cities market is no more viable and local commerce is very strong value of 10 rs is more strong as you go to smaller cities \n2 local kirana store are also changing them selves though it is not visible because no one is writing a report about them they are bringing more brands with home delivery saw that in gurgaon in near by sectors and in jaipur too \n3 fmcg companies will not let general trade die so easily they came earlier at same crossroads with flipkart udaan but it is important for them to keep this part due to business need and govt may force them to do so indirectly we saw this in electronics between 201316 but then companies started building their offlines channels again on similar footing \n4 my fathers generation likes social shopping they go to market daily for all essential needs i think i also dont want my child to just depend on ecommerce and surely will take him for more social shopping this habit change is expected in every zepto user once they cross certain age limit\n\nthey are many positives also in the favor of quick commerce specially like availability of items but do we need all these at 10 min\nthey are whale of instant delivery they will die only if consumer decided not to use qc all together which is now impossible due to the habit formation there was a foundational problem in byjus customer support sales and lot of trouble which i guess in zeptos case you cant see these there users keep going back to them\n\ni have seen zepto is next byjus bla bla maybe its coz its rooted in us that if someone is making progress quickly then we have to go behind them just because they are growing rapidly does not mean they are going to fail they have already overthrown instamart from the 2nd place\nthose guys are burning through 35m per month to just stay afloat \ud83d\ude02 i really wish to chat with

these quick delivery apps like blinkit and zepto survive longterm so i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free delivery\nhere to stay but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other channels highly possible that we will see more logistics companies coming up soon to deliver locally for restaurants mncs directly instead of working with q commerce"}]],"1":[[{"negative":0.0187719278,"neutral":0.2212947309,"positive":0.7599333525,"aspect":"zepto","text":"looking for a brotheror even a

money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life she responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere and i insisted on not missing the monetary benefits she asked why i hadnt started earlier and i said i didnt have a clear idea to start with and didnt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case then she talked about the mindset of zeptos founders a food delivery app and how they succeeded even after dropping out i called her out saying she was wrong and corrected her by saying zepto is a food delivery app she responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect\n\ni asked about the business and she said i wouldnt be able to fully understand it then she explained that they are in b2b ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to make my decision and have the money ready and once im in the business i would understand it fully she added that if it were on the internet or so public everyone would be doing this we are exclusive and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a partner we need to know each other and the business well i cant understand anything without being inside the business she said \n\nthis friend is more of an acquaintance and i dont know a lot about her how we met is an interesting story but it doesnt add any context here\n\nthe job requires 23 hours a day done digitally that friend bought a car recently and quit her fulltime job as well\n\nsounds like an mlm scheme or scam to me but is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it what is this business how does it operate is it legitimate\n\ni said no to join because i cant be part of anything i dont fully understand and its not public or on the internetanything protected and very private is a red flag for me and i cant put the money in it blindly\n\none more thing they kept calling each other sirmaam even though they are colleagues not a bangalore scam  it is an all india scam  you are right  it is a mlm or multi level marketing scheme  they talk as if what they are doing is the next big thing with some abstract terms compare their ideas to some successful founders they sell a lavish lifestyle wear fancy outfits and act like ceos and tell us that we need to get out of the routine 9 to 6 job rat race and to be financially independent and be our own boss they meet mostly in coffee shops as they have no office  and travel back usually in two wheelers or uber auto do not fall for their duplicate gucci bags  they are here to suck your money  dirty lowlife scums  instead of working to earn an living they are scamming other inoccent folks or thier hard earned savings\nyou didnt have to type this much its definitely a scam \ud83d\ude43\ni have to make a quick decision\u00a0  scam\n100

it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is not affected by the

myself buying all groceries from them super quick deliveries \n\ntime for renewal of membership still some bucks  though technically it had tripled now i think prices were still low but higher than

threat to the kirana stores \n\nalthough the quick commerce is really convenient and swanky it has its downsides \n\n1 always pay 60 rupees extra on each order in the name of delivery fee convenience etc\n2 overspending on these apps to reach a minimum order value \n3 buying vegetables is a hassle here\n\nwhat if we had an option of getting a delivery within 15 mins of your groceries from the nearby kirana stores in a radius of 5km \n\n this increases the visibility of that store\n and removes the convenience charge for the consumer\n it also plays on the factor of trust where you buy stuff from your trusted kirana store near you\n\nhow to make money\n\n the consumer pays a monthly pass of 500 for using the platform with zero convenience fees and delivery charges\n the kirana stores pay a fee to use the platform \n\nis this something that would interest you i think this is how the idea of zepto began but doing this is not very efficient they shifted to dark stores to improve that crazy level of efficiency and speed and also i dont think they are charging incorrectly they are giving you the service of delivering almost anything in 10 mins so dont you think that begets a bit of overhead cost\nthought about this personally and im sure a lot of other people have as well the primary reason this doesnt work is inventory management you cant track inventory at kirana stores all by yourself and all the kirana stores not only track inventory in different ways but also they also dont all do it digitally getting them to download use and get accustomed to your platform  let alone pay for it is a steep challenge in itself not to mention doing that on scale \n\nso showing inventory for different stores on the app having it updated at all times is not something thats feasible imo \n\nfor eg if i add a coke at 8 in the evening but the store doesnt have it because its out of coke they cant send in the order and the app doesnt know they dont have coke its chaos all around\n\nthat said the opportunity is massive the unorganised sector is huge and im sure kirana stores in tier 1 at least are losing business if you can solve for them help them make the app personal by putting faces and names of the uncles sitting at the shop it would be a unique personalised approach to make people feel like they arent being robbed and theyre being local by ordering from their friendly neighbourhood kirana shop\n\nsleep on it do some primary research and if you find a solid solution hit me up would love to throw my hands on this one\nthese downsides youve listed are a real stretch and arent really that much of a problem\n\n zepto pass costs just 39 rupees a month with that frankly ridiculously low fee i get a lot of additional monthly discounts\n\n delivery is free above 99 rupees which you cross by adding just two or three items\n\n not sure what problem youre hinting at when youre talking about ordering veggies and fruits if youre talking about quality youll sometimes fave the same issues when your kirana or veggie vendor also deliver\n\nthis post may sound like im a huge proponent of zepto im not these guys are using vc monies to kill local businesses its unfair and predatory\n\nbut most ppl dont care youre getting anything you want within ten mins and at great discounts\n\ndig deeper here to find a more genuine insight\nimo they are doing great  i just signed in as a delivery partner for fun to understand their working and to explore new places and meet new people it was great experience  and it was crazy people are ordering like hell i stay in electronics city phase 1 and in night 12 to 2 am  order where more then day time   is it good or bad   \nand the management at their store is next level they are doing really great in some parts of region\nachieving quick deliveries under 15 mins with a kirana store is next to impossible dark stores by these companies are efficient maybe this model can work with semi quick deliveries under 90 mins maybe"}]],"14":[[{"negative":0.0054989266,"neutral":0.3888889849,"positive":0.6056120992,"aspect":"zepto","text":"starting my new venture that helps d2c

serious in life i have a lifechanging opportunity for you\n\nonly condition is are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent \n\n\n\nthis post could be the life changing for you might be long\n\n\n\nto give you some context \n\ni am an integral part of an amazing startup i wont name it here but i can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn to give you a brief idea about us we are a delivery startup \n\nyou might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories \n\n\n\nknows about native app development \n\nwell assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week if you complete it within the timeframe well start your stipend\n\n\n\ndoesnt know about app development \n\neven if you dont know anything about app development but youre a determined individual who wants to achieve something then you are welcome in our startup\n\nwe are ready to invest in you working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach youwithin a year of working with a startup you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nfor learning well first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 34 days if you show that youre a smart quick learner well start your stipend \n\nthis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\nthis opportunity is open to everyone even if youve just started your first year of college doesnt matter were looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work\n\n\n\nfuture plans \n\n\n\nif you stick with us well continue paying your stipend and once we have full confidence in your work after 46 months well hire you directly within a year you could be earning at least \n\n10 lpa and if you show extraordinary skills 15 lpa i know offering this package

bikes racing around the city \n\ni also recognise they have to meet the 10 min delivery promise from these quick commerce companies \n\nnow im spending my weekend trying to get my car sorted \n\nhow do you generally deal with these \n\nedit the rod attached to the wheel is bent i just hope this doesnt cost an arm and a leg to fix\n\nfolks from zepto called me to request details on the driver i told them i didnt have any \n\nim trying to get a cctv recording from a nearby shop  similar thing happened to me cant do anything about them they dont have the time to argue neither do we luckily not much damage happened in my case driving in bangalore rises bp fs\ntoday a fkr stopped in the middle of the road literally blocking 2 lanes pulled out his phone and started typing something the amount of dumb fks on our roads is terrifying\nhappened with me twice when a delivery guy on two wheeler and an auto overtook from left when there was hardly any space in the first case i came very close to hitting an suv to avoid collision with the two wheeler now i simply close the gap while approaching a turn to eliminate any possibility of such stunts by stupid drivers\nearlier bull guards helped save bumbers now since government has banned them they easily get damaged by two wheelers\n2 wheelers suddenly overtaking from the left are a big menace you just start sliding left or slide a but to avoid something on the right and out of nowhere one of them would narrowly miss you and then angrily stare at you like its your fault"}]],"20":[[{"negative":0.7128375769,"neutral":0.2588630021,"positive":0.0282993801,"aspect":"zepto","text":"40 tax not swiggy but similar tactics everywhere  note so i noticed this on zepto but ive seen similar charges on all quick commerce apps just using it for reference here\n\nso i added 2 items to my cart one for 170 and the other for 100 so the total is 270 now these are already mrp items so the tax is include\n\nthe app added a handling fee  1 tobacco product convenience fee and delivery fee of 999 19 and 27 respectively which are all understandable\n\nwhat i dont understand is that gst and cess on handling is 4 4004 and on delivery is 1082 4007 respectively last i remember the maximum highest gst was 28 how are they charging approximately 40\n\nalso i noticed although i have zepto pass the free delivery isnt auto applied you have to manually apply it the only thing i hate is\nto have to click on apply to unlock free delivery like bitch who wants to click everyone wants free delivery\nsomewhere we allowed these food delivery appsknowingly or unknowingly to loot us we all became dependent on these apps and somehow we gave them the power and now theyre making profits  with all the access\n1082 is 18 on 56 482 i dont know maybe someone else can shed a light\ngst is 18 balance may be cess due to tobacco\nmany products like sugary carbonated beverages attract a gst of 28 plus 12 cess adding up to 40 your rationale that the maximum gst in india is 28 is

this i usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy this incident made me reconsider my thoughts\n\ni typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab since its raining in bengaluru i need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else i would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella\n\n the concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up\n\nits the after sales support im worried about no checking or returns at doorstep selling old expired or near expiry items returned and repackaged or seal broken and used items irresponsible customer care agents\n\nthats sorta things\neverything is worth it if you have money and people like those on this sub often can trade money for convenience\nwell of course billions of dollars are being poured by vcs into this industry theyre not fools to be so bullish on this for no reason \n\nside note how are you able to walk the distance thats equivalent to almost 300 cab fare\nyeah we had a 40hour power outage here because of the cyclone so i ordered a power bank from instamart with extra discount and 10 cashback  fully charged saved my phones battery from dying\nmy dad works on a laptop which doesnt have a functioning keyboard so he uses external keyboard one day that stopped working as well my dad wasnt well and i work in

from 50 dark stores in 2021 to over 750 today with plans for 1200 by march 2025 their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from 77 crore to 250300 crore yet investors have poured in 135 billion in 2024 alone why\n\nthe answer lies in what theyre really building a massive consumer behavior database each dark store isnt just a warehouse  its a data collection center tracking thousands of households purchasing patterns brand preferences and price sensitivities\n\nfmcg companies are noticing industry sources indicate major brands are creating zeptospecific products and packages the power dynamic is shifting  when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers traditional retail relationships change\n\nthe expansion raises questions in mumbai alone over 200 local retail spaces now house zeptos dark stores each requires specific zoning permissions affecting local real estate markets meanwhile internal documents mention development of backend mother hubs automation systems even as the company aggressively hires with abovemarket salaries\n\ntheir supersaver feature requires minimum orders of 999  a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics it suggests a broader plan for market control\n\nthe environmental impact deserves scrutiny with 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured\n\nzepto promises an ipo within 24 months while planning major operational changes their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by march 2025 these timelines create interesting questions about their longterm strategy\n\nwhat were witnessing might be more than quick commerce its potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience every order every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how india shops\n\nthe implications warrant discussion how will this affect local retail networks what happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value when does convenience become control\n\nthese arent hypothetical concerns the next time your phone lights up with a zepto notification consider you might be feeding data into a system thats fundamentally changing indias

offered similar services in germany since 2021 and is now expanding itll offer customers interest rates as high as 358 for savings in the us klarna doesnt have a banking license and is operating through partner banks its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the us as the money held isnt protected by the fdic there is also no interest offered to us customers\n\ntiktok users in the us who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to 300 in discounts or a 100 amazon gift card for every new creator they refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for thirdparty messaging apps like whatsapp to share and discuss videos\n\nftc announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials

sale in its soundcloud store from there soundcloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch the service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100 of the profits from sales \n\namazon is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection

legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform

is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature indecent or inappropriate which has resulted in censorship shadow bans and removal of their advertisements this ones tough to judge on one hand i understand where nood is coming from just because their products are made for womens breasts doesnt intrinsically make their products sexual in nature on the other hand some of noods ads are objectively sexualized designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless only to look closer and discover that shes wearing a skin tone nipple cover many users wouldnt consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds and platforms have a responsibility to their users and other advertisers to only show content that adheres to their community

they had lawyers to sort things out he later asked for the nowdeleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying so in the example that i gave of the tiktok competitor and by the way i was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybodys music what you would do if youre a silicon valley entrepreneur which hopefully all of you will be is if it took off then youd hire a whole

unfulfilled deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating had very similar experiences with zepto instamart blinkit etc similar

grocery delivery apps during the lockdown for urgent needs ive always gone to the local store next to my apartment or other stores nearby however when im coming back home late at night after work around 910 ive been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like zepto im saying its a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy zepto was making losses and they were burning vc pe money\n\nbut that era is coming to an end\n\nit is never possible to deliver at the costs they did earlier forgot

up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those

bail dont have any means of earning money they dont have skills to do skill based  job neither capital to do any business so easiest job is to delivery guy whether its amazon flipkart zepto zomato swiggy blinkit or big basket etc\n\nthese companies dont do any background verification and having criminal record will not stop anyone from getting employeed as a delivery guy so always be careful about these people\n\npoverty is often romanticised on internet portraying these people as honest but in reality they are often involved in crime regularly they steal cloths hanging on rope shoes inside apartment some of them work as as delivery boys during day and do robbery at same houses at night after doing reece during delivery job \n\ni am sorry to hear happened to your partner\ni have

delivery guy with 34 bags of zepto blinkit etc staring into the opening of this cafe\n\nit was very cold 10 degrees and he was standing still with eerie silence there were quite a few people inside this cafe of the same age as that of the delivery guy and they were partying playing snooker and drinking coffee right in front of that window opening\n\nhe must have completed his last deliveries nearby as his electric scooter was parked nearby i passed just next to him and he didnt even flinch or even notice\n\nthere was music and noise coming from inside of the cafe but there was absolute silence outside where he was standing\n\nreminds me to stay humble and appreciate little things in life hope i stay grateful for the things this universe has provided me\n\ni hope he gets to visit this cafe someday with his friends if he has any and enjoy a good day there \n\nps i couldnt do anything to help him im a student and hes better off earning by working hard as delivery person so theres nothing i could have really done its crazy how many of us take things for granted whether its money relationships or anything else gratitude is what we need because there is always someone else praying for the life we already have we have food clothes a house to live in while a homeless person is sleeping under a bridge with an empty stomach\n\ngratitude people gratitude\na punch of

endured\nlife is never fair there is always someone better than  you and always someone below you just today only i was feeling jealous of my friend whose parents sent him abroad  while i couldnt afford that but this picture now humbled me sometimes we become so busy in creating unnecessary problems that we forgot to appreciate what we have and its dream of so many to just be where you are

a whale of instant delivery in making or a byjus of instadelivery ecosystem in making  why is zepto valued that high  reminds of the time  when byjus was also valued at 22b  today the reality is different \nof course comparing apples to oranges is a bad thing but is zepto really that reliable  is it overhyped a push from investors who over valued  or is it really solving something at core  \n\nnovice here no hate just asking what it felt  we should look at what happened to mom and pop retail in the useurope and to some extent in australia\n\nbig retail and ecommerce entered cities and towns and undercut mom and pop shops forcing them to close down eventually they started chasing profit maximization and raised prices demand fell as people found themselves unable to afford the inventory the large stores then were no longer needed and the brands realised it was not worth it to operate and started closing down these stores eventually vaste swathes of urban centres in north americaeurope and australia often operate without any retail stores these are called food desertsretail deserts and this phenomenon is now being studied extensively\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\ni fear similar thing might happen in a lot of tier 1 and 2 cities here especially places with high rentals such as select neighborhoods in bangalore koramangala hsr whitefield mumbai anything south of bandra hyderabad jubilee hills madhapur and nanakramgudafinancial district side gurugram all sectors coming up along golf curse road and golf course extension road people will eventually end up paying a very high price for daily essentials this will be tough for any pensioners or young professionals who start on low paygrades\ni am not investor or banker i am just a common citizen so take my word with a pinch of a salt i know nothing about how capital market works\n\nmy take about quick commerce companies is that those companies will vanish just quickly like they have popped up in next 5 to 10 years reason being that their business is not sustainable soon they will run out of their deep pocketed funds they will decrease their discounts and eventually ordering from them will become a hassle people will go back to old kirana stores if any has left after so many years once deep discounts are stopped\nwhole valuation of startups now a days is based on fairy future which investors wants to see they dont consider any hiccups at this point with quick commerce because it is flourishing well and giving new jobs to people even at the cost of old ones\nbut sooner of later whole growth will stablize at single decimal pct why\n1 after top 5060 cities market is no more viable and local commerce is very strong value of 10 rs is more strong as you go to smaller cities \n2 local kirana store are also changing them selves though it is not visible because no one is writing a report about them they are bringing more brands with home delivery saw that in gurgaon in near by sectors and in jaipur too \n3 fmcg companies will not let general trade die so easily they came earlier at same crossroads with flipkart udaan but it is important for them to keep this part due to business need and govt may force them to do so indirectly we saw this in electronics between 201316 but then companies started building their offlines channels again on similar footing \n4 my fathers generation likes social shopping they go to market daily for all essential needs i think i also dont want my child to just depend on ecommerce and surely will take him for more social shopping this habit change is expected in every zepto user once they cross certain age limit\n\nthey are many positives also in the favor of quick commerce specially like availability of items but do we need all these at 10 min\nthey are whale of instant delivery they will die only if consumer decided not to use qc all together which is now impossible due to the habit formation there was a foundational problem in byjus customer support sales and lot of trouble which i guess in zeptos case you cant see these there users keep going back to them\n\ni have seen zepto is next byjus bla bla maybe its coz its rooted in us that if someone is making progress quickly then we have to go behind them just because they are growing rapidly does not mean they are going to fail they have already overthrown instamart from the 2nd place\nthose guys are burning through 35m per month to just stay afloat \ud83d\ude02 i really wish to chat with their
