where i swiggy offers to talk to a customer executive\ni was instead cut off with bot replies asking me to email them will be attaching screenshots below \n\nonce i email them i got a reply saying they are sad that neither refund or replacement can be done\nno reason is mentioned as to why\nim not able to raise further requests on the app also\nthen i tried instagram and i one shit reply saying

stuck at application status even though i had completed kyc for axis before this plan on using neo only for the 1st 100 utility bill cashback\n\ncan someone tell if swiggy hdfc card gives 5 cashback if we order from dmart ready app and star bazaar app grocieries are the cheapest there makes no sense to buy from instamart \n\nthis is fyf i will close in june next year if i get airtel axis and  if they dont make this ltf\nof all the bank apps i use hdfc is the worst icici is the best idfc and au bank have good ui ","11":"hey everyone im dealing with an ongoing issue with my airtel axis credit card and wanted to see if anyone here has faced something similar or could offer advice i was approved for the card in july but since then i havent received the correct cashback based on the cards cashback policy ive raised the issue multiple times but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution\n\nhere are the details\n\nfirst month i spent about 2500 on swiggy but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountbut based on my calculations i should have received 640\n\nswiggy transactions issue some swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as instamart orders which likely use a different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed","12":"got this card ltf and i wanted to know does this card gives cashback on payment like utilities payment through amazon app also while ordering from swiggy before payment on food section is shows me how much cashback i can earn whereas in instamart it doesnt \ndoes this mean i am not eligible for instamart cashback or is it just a bug","14":"i was using instamart but most of the times the main items are not in stock ","15":"pune and mumbai have an app which we sadly dont swiggy instamart la tobacco irrukku aana sarakku illa if any swiggy employee or tech bros reading this then please capitalise on this market vaccum\n\nthe tasmac

malls\n\ncurious how other people in the city do it","16":"i usually dont take complaints to social media but im really frustrated with swiggy instamart and hope sharing this experience might make them take it more seriously or at least warn others \n\nordered hersheys chocolate spread from swiggy instamart but received a packet of milk reported the issue immediately through the apps support sectionno action taken after waiting i had to send a separate email to get any response which took even longer\n\nswiggys response an apology but no refund or replacement just a vague promise to share feedback with the store its frustrating that swiggy expects me to bear this loss and i didnt even get what i paid for i always believed swiggy valued customer experience but this situation has really shaken my trust\n\nhas anyone else faced similar issues with swiggy instamart any advice on escalating this\n\n","20":"tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber","21":"is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any

terribly sorry if this isnt the right flair or sub for this \n \nedit no they didnt take my phone but who knows dont be like me \n\nmyntra delivery guys are asking to show myntra feedback form which you receive in your mail which rates myntra services and then giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it \n\nwhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver itll be given separately they are saying no its from the same form when explained that delivery rating is separate from myntra rating theyre unable to explain themselves and saying no its the same its not \n\n\nif youre ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them right it has happened with me several times with even zomato instamart zepto etc \n\nso i thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback but the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of myntra not the delivery executive \n\nhe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail i told him i wont because i do not want to rate myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and thats all they should care about \n\nplease dont give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service if yes tell them you can do that on app and dont let them rate it for you \n","23":"i ordered from instamart this noon and paid via amazon pay but this weird thing happened \nthe delivery guy showed up and said theres a technical issue and that swiggy cs was trying to call me he asked me to pay in cash saying id get a refund later\n\nhe took my phone saying he was asked to call customercare upon reaching loaction when i saw he typed something in the help chat i insisted ill handle it myself and he gave my phone back \n\ni called cs explained everything and they said theyd speak to the delivery guy and told to stay on hold after a while the call disconnected\n\ni asked for my parcel he gave it to me but also gave his number sayingi told cs you paid in cash just transfer the money to me when you get the refund and walked away\n\nhes now pestering me with calls to transfer the money and when i told him the call with cs got disconnected he was like arey maam call pe rehna tha nanow you tell the same over chat and transfer me the money when you get refund\n\ni told him my payment already went through but he keeps saying its a technical issue happening with other customers in my area the app still says paid and i havent received any refund\n\nwhats happening this never happened beforehow should i handle it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedit from what others have said it seems like this might be a new scam targeting prepaid customers i told the delivery guy straight up to sort it out with swiggys since my payment clearly showed as successful then i ignored his next two calls and he hasnt bothered me since i also left some negative feedback and gave him a low ratingno idea if itll make a difference but it felt the right thing to do","24":"so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n","25":"lmao i just realised instamart works here people with android phones need to side load the lite version of the app to buy cigs","26":"i dont know if

swiggy has looted me for the 3rd time with the same excuse\n\ni have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay when i place an instamart order the app takes me to the bank otp screen an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited even order history shows nothing naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same this has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if its a tactic to inflate revenuesales\n\nthe first time it happened i ignore it as an oversight on my part \n\nthe second time after 2 different drivers gave me the same items i contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldnt have accepted the items now we cant do anything\n\nthe 3rd time today the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times this time i made the drivers wait till i got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted mr that if i raise a chat ticket they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money so i let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said  sorry sir you accepted the order so now i cant give you any refund i am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that i was falling in the same situation i have written an email to instamart support but i really think im done with this app\n\nattaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is\n\nwonder if anyone else has gone

any card from icici \ni had hpcl super saver that i got from college but you can try getting either sapphiro ltf through alumni offer if you are a graduate from a top university or otherwise get a basic icici platinum credit card\n now go to amazon app make sure your amazon account has the same phone number as your icici accountcredit card and have a decent shopping history on amazon through that account email id can be different its okay being a prime member is an advantage\n activate amazonpay wallet with full kyc so that you have good limit this will also ensure that you actually get your cashback in this wallet every month\n now wait for 36 months keep checking your imobile pay app every month \n mostly you will get an offer to generate a lifetime free coral rupay card this means you have a significant banking history with icici bank such that the bank is ready to give you more cards on a shared limit \n now go to amazon and apply for the amazon pay icici credit card \n once it asks you for otp on sms if it asks you to enter your existing icici cards last 4 digits et viola youre in \n give them the basic details they wont ask you anything much no kyc no salary details nothing as the bank got it all from you when you applied for the first card\n your amazonpay icici credit card will get generated in the next hour and you can get it delivered in post within a week depending on your location and the speed of blue dart\n this didnt create a cibil enquiry as this newly generated card will share your existing limit\n might as well generate the coral rupay card later if you dont have an ltf rupay card and your usage is minimal \n\ndo note the issuance of amazonpay icici card also depends on pincode and other factors but this is the easiest way to get this card\n\nhowever even after all this you dont get this card there are alternative cards that ofcourse restrict the cashback categories and the amount monthly \n\n1 sbi cashback 999gst  5 upto 5k every

actually takes 10  15 mins which includes the delivery person most of the times calling me inspite of the address being very clear along with hard to miss landmarks right on the main road \n\n\nbut because they use some kinda radius which they consider to change the status of delivery person as arrived at the location the order is always marked as arrived at my location even before it leaves the dark store potentially as soon as its packed \n\n\ni dont really mind the order coming in 10  15 mins or even more than that also it only gets marked as delivered after the order is in my hand so that

\n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom","81":"hi guys any appservices available in guwahati that delivers grocery items within a dayfew hours i am

customer their app doesnt feel very differentiated to me if either of them do something new the other also soon gets there discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on zomato and i dont think those are available in every city\n\nbut what about their restaurant app and their support services are their restaurant services significantly different im sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants or are they pretty similar there as well ","93":"guys i am a cc lover love to research and learn about cards and how to use them to maximise the benefit\nright now i have hdfc millenia and airtel axis card which covers 5 cashbacks for major online purchase and utility bill payments through axis the spend where i dont get cashbacks was other online merchants which millenia doesnt not give and some online grocery stores like zepto instamart \nwas thinking how to cover those i am confused between sbi cashback and hsbc \nsbi cashback is really great option but using park app i am afraid it may devalue in coming time and then the card benefits would just be straight 5 \nas for hsbc it would cover only my grocery needs but could be a good option if i want to cover those\n\nanyone experienced in this sub please tell me which one should i go for\nin short i want to cover all merchants to atleast get some value while

expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense   \n\n\na simple transaction of getting what i paid for as consumer shouldnt be such a gamble swiggy instamart

\n\nshould i take the card as this would be my first hdfc cc and i had read in some of the posts that a cobranded card is not be taken as ones first hdfc card\n\nalso my swiggy spends are not humongous and i am just considering this card as a good to have for the 5 cashback offer as i dont have the sbi cashback cc and for use it maybe 23 times a month for groceries on instamart \nanother factor for me to consider this card is because they have now updated their tc to subtract the cashback from the monthly statement instead of giving it in the swiggy wallet\n\nalso is this card excluded from online stores during salesoffers pertaining to hdfc cc offers for ex  big billion days apple days etc","98":"lately ive realised that whenever i shop my grocery i remember most of it

what happened was the fare was paid by simpl which she did not realize as there was no otp verification for the payment so as usually she paid in cash upi as well fare was 536rs stayed the same till the end and 94rs which got deducted by the time of reaching the destination to 71rs\n\nin jan 2024 they have called her to remind to pay back the money already there has been an interest added to the sum twice by that time she told me that she never signed up for simpl pay service and also there was no otp verification to go through with the payment so i logged into simpl app using her mobile number and got to know that the account has been activate in 2022 itself as there was a transaction to swiggy instamart\n\nso i contacted the rapido support and informed them what happened with screenshots of transctions they have called back and said we will initiate the rufund and closed the call but they have only refunded 200rs of 536rs fare and 71rs of 94rssimpl actually paid 94rs to the driver  these got reflected in simpl pay statement contacted them again with the issue and they said that they can only refund upto 200rs i started an argument after that they said they will refund the rest of the money as well and closed the call there has been no message regarding the refund from simpl and the statement contacted simpl regarding the issue to confirm if they have received a rest of the refund if not please call me back which they never did and keep rotating the same statement to be paid instead of addressing my query rapido keeps saying that they have done the full refund from their end i asked for some sort of confirmation as i did not receive any notification message or email validating the refund no reply\n\nnow it has been a while and simpl pay has been sending mails like we have initiated a legal notice from an advocate and stuff\n\ncan someone help with a legal advice\n\nx200b","100":"dont know where to post this so let me know if this is the worng group\n\ni ordered some facewash from swiggy instamart when the product arrived it had offer buy 1 get 1 free printed on it in huge font\nso the first thought i had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 5060 of the product cost like most of the local shopkeepers do for bogo but no what i paid on swiggy was 90 of the product cost but didnt get the fee product with it \n\nwhen i contacted support and asked for 50 refund of the product cost or the free product they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app\n\ndont you guys think its kinda like doing fraud with the customer\n","101":"hey guys\nthis is for general awareness ive been using both zomato and swiggy for a long time \n\n1 product charges are higher on swiggy than on zomato delivery fee is higher heres the kicker  im a swiggy one member the same sandwich costs 250 on zomato and 270 on swiggy total ended up being higher by rs 60 this happens so much with every order that i dont even need to check with swiggy app now swiggy overcharging is a delhi thing i spoke to a few friends in other city and they dont face this issue \n\nyoure better off comparing with swiggy and zomato \n\n2 instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than blinkit as well a lot of times not always \n\n3 instamart changes final billorder on the app this has happened to me and my friends we placed order for x received y checked app and app showed that order was placed for y not x after this happened a couple times we started to take screenshots asap after placing order it happened again but this time we had proof complained but nothing happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i havent used instamart a lot in these months\n\nthats all please take this as my opinion check for yourself when making purchases  \n\nhope this helps in some way

Not sure what to say\nIts not a scam. I think the powerbank is working fine. If you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left, it is fine.\n20k maH Powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure. Thats all.\nLet me see if I can explain this.\nSee what is the voltage of your powerbank. These are normally 3.7 V. So, the total wattage is 3.7 v * 20000 mah = 3.7 V * 20 Ah = 74 Wh.\n\nPhones operate at 5 V. So, a single full charge of the phone need wattage = 5 V * 4500 mAh = 5 V * 4.5 Ah = 22.5 Wh\n\nSo, number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank = 74 \/ 22.5 = 3.28 times. Considering 10-15% wastage, you will be able to charge it around 2.8 times. So, after 2 charges, if it is having some more charge, then I think that the powerbank is fine. You are expecting too much from the powerbank. You can buy another powerbank from Amazon \/ Flipkart, but you will probably get similar results.\nWhat were your expectations though?\nIt's not a scam, it's working as expected. I think you are misunderstanding how pb works, as many comments have corrected your expectations.","9":"Yes, that's really scummy of them. You now have to 'apply' free delivery with Zepto pass.\nRecently, Zomato had an offer where a free burger was given on orders above 600.\n\nI was alone, so I called my friend and we placed an order for 600. However, we did not receive the extra burger.\n\nUpon checking the cart, we noticed that there was a tick box that needed to be ticked in order to avail the offer \ud83d\ude11\nThese apps are unprofitable and have to resort to such practices in desperation. \n\nMaybe design a better business model that's actually sustainable lol.\nInstamart> Blinkit> Zepto , Follow this, Instamart is good, Blinkit has a lot of products and Zepto only if you need something which is unavailable on both the apps.\nI even tweeted this tagging them - they simply asked to DM my details and then ignored","10":"At least you don't have to pay for these!\n\nTry joining r\/watchesindia\nCheck out HSBC Live+ card if your sole purpose is cashback on groceries\u00a0\nSomewhere I read in sub, dmart ready online gives u 5% cashback , dmart offline won't..search in this sub read recently only\nCongratulations! What's the limit?\nThe MCC for Dmart ready and offline Dmart is 5411 which is not included in the list, so, no, it won't. Swiggy would want you to use Instamart so why would they let you get discount on other grocery and supermarkets. \ud83d\ude05","11":"Not everything's a scam dude.

I can't say what's up with that.\nHey, this happened the first two months with me too. I kept raising complaints and not talking to the first level of customer care but escalating to the next one.

I guess I am gonna need it coz after watching this I will have to calculate mine as well.\nThis is an issue with Swiggy. They alternatively use the MCCs interchangeably. I have been seeing this issue for last 2 years","12":"Yes, after the new changes, all your Swiggy(Swiggy Food or Instamart)orders will get 10% cashback straight to your credit card, which is great.(Provided you don't spend over 15000\/-).

But only imported bottles.","16":"If you\u2019re willing enough then go to consumer court, That or a social media outrage\nI have encountered similar situations. Had to reach out to customer service several times to ensure I received the refund amount. I relentlessly contacted them until I got my refund.\nOrder milk instead and get Hershey's \ud83d\ude09\nI usually get refunds. Btw I am almost a regular customer.\nIf you used a credit card for payment, contact your bank to start a chargeback process. Provide them with all the relevant transaction details, ensuring your request is officially recorded. Also ask for a request or case number for your reference.  \nI know this may sound petty but if they are going to take your money, let them work for it.","20":"Atleast add a TLDR because it was TLDR \ud83e\udd72\n>SBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nThis can happen with Flipkart too, and I'd dare say that Flipkart nerf is more likely given it's a loss maker compared to SBI.\n\nAmazon won my loyalty long ago with Prime membership and consistency in reliability of service. They have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues. So the ICICI Amazon Pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping. \n\nHDFC Millennia and Swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and I just got SBI Cashback on top of it, so there's no reason to even look at a Flipkart branded card.\n\nAlso the Supercoin shit seems confusing, I seem to earn them but can't redeem them? The Swiggy Card's reward is much better for Swiggy anyway, so using that for Swiggy is a waste.\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part SBI employees might be watching this\nI would counter your perspective on groceries. Although prices on Flipkart are always less, the variety is minimum. The available options nowhere come near BigBasket or Blinkit. And the obvious that Flipkart doesn't have Quick Commerce, so BB or Blinkit wins there.\n\nMy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours. No Myntra and Nykaa, but almost 4k worth of medicines either from PharmEasy or 1Mg.\n\nFor Amazon ICICI, non-prime members get 3% cb.\n\nThe spending criteria doesn't make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh+ only on one CC for all 12 months.\n\nSo neither Flipkart Axis nor APay ICICI comes close to SBI CB.\nSBI CB and Flipkart Axis both have their own use cases. You like Flipkart Axis over SBI CB because you make substantial purchase on Flipkart.\nFlipkart Axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart. So yes, Flipkart Axis is good enough on Flipkart website but that's about it. SBI CB shines everywhere. If someone's purchase isn't substantial enough on Flipkart then Flipkart Axis is pointless for that person and SBI CB make more sense. Your post looks more like a marketing for Flipkart Ecom than comparing Flipkart Axis with other cards side by side.\nI see this more often for people holding Amazon Pay ICICI credit card, they pretend like it is some really amazing card but it's not. Apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as Flipkart Axis. These both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective Ecom.","21":"They prey on the negligence of the people \ud83e\udd21.\nNot zepto user but if there are limited free delivery on pass then this button is valid else they are just trying to loot extra money\nIt's a common dark pattern found in videogames that have predatory practices.  You still have to hit apply on free delivery after paying for the pass, many would forget to do that. Someone should drag them to court over it or drag their name through mud for them to make it a default option for pass holders. \n\nFuckers are learning terrible things from big gaming companies. This practice will be adopted by other apps too if these greedy idiots aren't shamed enough.\nZepto is ruining its name.. By introducing new Features.\nLmao what is handling fee if they are charging delivery fee","22":"By reading the title, I thought the delivery guy took the phone and ran off\nI told the delivery person that I don\u2019t get feedback emails and messages from Myntra, when he asked me for it.

Report to Swiggy customer support that this dude is harassing you asking to pay, even though the payment went through via Amazon. He himself typed \"Call us on 0806817...\" which is a swiggy customer care no.  very fishy.\n\nIf he calls you again and you intend to pick up. Tell him to talk to Swiggy about it, its his company's problem if there's a glitch. Not yours. You paid and haven't gotten a refund, if you do get a refund, just pay up to that no. Simple as that.\nNever give your phone to anyone. And Swiggy doesn't TRY to call you, they call you. This guy is a con, report him.\nTalk to cs and ask for an agent. If the order says paid, check Amazon pay wallet for any refunds\nDelivery guy is just trying to scam you nothing else. Wait for response from their customer service. and if the delivery guy is still harassing , please share his number in dm this is not okay. Such scammers deserve something serious. I know someone in swiggy who can help you with this situation\nBrooooo same thing happened to me it's a scam. It happened in Vizag for me, i ordered stuff in instamart, prepaid it using my Sodexo card.. I'm new to this card usage as it a meal card for employees, i received a call from swiggy before them almost approaching to my house, caller said payment is still processing and delayed from bank end and cut the phone. So this delivery guy shows up along with another guy behind holding my stuff worth 1k, and they started this story that payment is delayed and they create this scene of urgency, they almost gave it away for me when they got the price wrong and I was very dum and agreed to pay they got this UPI scanner ready and I did and they are gone, I understood that I have a bigger brain later that night after seeing that no refund was got and it's still showing paid. And I showed this whole story to contact us staff and they can't do not sh*t. So moral of the story this is a scam and nothing can be done against it.","24":"I have done this manually. \n\nAnd No one buys a single product. \n\nLets say I need to Buy 5 items. \n\nItem 1 is cheap on big basket\nItem 2 is cheap on Zepto\n\nItem 3 is cheap on Instamart\n\nItem 4 is cheap on blinkit. \n\nEtc\n\nThen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery. Some have Rs 99 and some has Rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery.\nBecause I will not buy Rs 89 avacodo from Big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it. \nSo I will not buy avacodo just from Big Basket as other items are costly on Big Basket or some items are not available which I need. \n\nWhat to do now?\n\nGet conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores? \n\nAlso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers? \n\nThe tomato I order from Zepto and Flipkart Minutes are different in quality. Zepto tomato is costly but also high quality. Now they don't list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better. Can you compare quality? \n\nEven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points. Why? Because the costlier ones are bright, more aesthetic perfect shape. \n\nThe cheaper ones have holes, little soft(got stale a little) etc. \n\nWhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato? \n\nI have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better.\nTo compare you need their data.

In it's abscene, it's just burning VC money. \n\nUnlike your typical Kirana store, you have a mobile application to maintain (iOS + Android), marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees. Your usual Kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do.\nLike it depends if people in that city prefer convience, & also has high spending power. Than it'll work.\nTier 2-3 cities usually don\u2019t have that kind of spending power. They would go out and buy it. Tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra. \n\nBlinkit and Zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them. At any day I would save 5-10rs if I find a better price in either of the platforms. \n\nTier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit. Unless you don\u2019t have money to burn forget about it\nIt depends on the people...are they aware of such things?\nRecently, I came across the Namm Yatri app and loved their business model. Unlike Ola and Uber, which take a commission on every ride, NammaYatri uses a subscription-based SaaS approach. Drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app, and the rest of the money goes directly to them. It made me think: what if we applied this to grocery delivery? Instead of relying on dark warehouses like Zepto, we could use the existing network of local kirana stores. Consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store. The app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock, and delivery agents (who pay a small subscription fee) would pick up the items and deliver them. Payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth.\n\nBut of course, there are some challenges:\n\t\u2022\tStock availability\n\t\u2022\tStore hours limitations\n\t\u2022\tPrice inconsistency (can be solved with in-app payments)\n\t\u2022\tProduct quality\n\nIt\u2019s a simple idea, but I think it could really work if executed well.","27":"Fantasizing laziness \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\nSaw Zepto's ads on compound gates of residences in Tilakwadi.\nDamn it's still unavailable in my area..

I just faced the same issue., in my case the product was half eaten \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\nI recently had a horrible experience with instamart's customer care service. And this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies. I had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire room's electrical input when I plugged it in (the rest of the house was fine). \n\nI ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them, asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back.\n\nTheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical. When I mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in, would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses AGAIN- through no fault of my own; their responses were flat validations.\n\nI then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if I were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that.\n\nAnd I have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund.\nUnfortunately I am in a city where only instamart is available, if not I always avoid them.\n\nThis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable.\nI don\u2019t know but I use blinkit as instamart isn\u2019t available in my city and blink it\u2019s support is good.","97":"","98":"","99":"Forget the refund from them and, also ignore their threats \nBoth are just not happening","100":"","101":"This thread is flaired as \"Serious\".

Fuck axis  Hey everyone, I\u2019m dealing with an ongoing issue with my Airtel Axis credit card and wanted to see if anyone here has faced something similar or could offer advice. I was approved for the card in July, but since then, I haven\u2019t received the correct cashback based on the card\u2019s cashback policy. I\u2019ve raised the issue multiple times, but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nFirst Month: I spent about \u20b92,500 on Swiggy but only received \u20b9140 in cashback(not yet credited in account).As per the 10% cashback policy, I should have received at least \u20b9200.\n\nSeptember Statement: I earned \u20b9420 in cashback(not yet credited in account)but based on my calculations, I should have received \u20b9640.\n\nSwiggy Transactions Issue: Some Swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as Instamart orders, which likely use a different MCC (Merchant Category Code). Because of this, I\u2019m not getting the right cashback, which is unfair. It seems like a Swiggy issue, but I\u2019m the one being penalized.\n\nMoreover, since I got the card, I haven\u2019t received a single rupee cashback in my statement! I\u2019ve emailed Axis twice about this, and here\u2019s what they replied:\n\n \"We would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldn't be shared since there is category-wise capping. We don't have the function to send the breakup of cashback. Cashbacks are system-generated, and hence, a breakup is not available. Please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less.\nWe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the Swiggy App for Food Delivery and Dineout. If you make a transaction on Instamart, Genie, etc., you will not be eligible for cashback.\"\n\nIt feels like I\u2019m being tossed around here, and I don\u2019t know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else.

Any advice on escalating this?\n\n","20":"Why people ditch their Flipkart axis card for SBI CB and other cb cards?\n **TL;DR (though I insist, pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a): The Flipkart Axis card, despite its bad reputation, offers significant benefits for frequent Flipkart  shoppers, including  beyond 5% cashback and additional perks. Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S. Don't judge me as some marketing agent of Flipkart or Axis. I'm an ardent member of this sub, always looking for those tips and hacks. Also, I'm not against SBI CB, HDFC swiggy or millenia, I too have SBI CB, it's a beast that I happily use for other purposes. It's just that I haven't closed my FK Axis rn, bearing that \u20b9590 annually \ud83d\ude05, cuz who knows. And Axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past. If you can use and keep it all, better. But, always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robo-thinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber.","21":"New Zepto Scam?

So, I was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting. The price on BigBasket was \u20b989, on Blinkit it was \u20b9105, and Zepto had it for \u20b998. Naturally, I wondered \u2013 if the prices for one item differ this much, what about other groceries? I checked a few more items and, sure enough, almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts, promotions, or delivery fees.\n\nThat got me thinking: why isn\u2019t there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps?\n\nImagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get real-time price comparisons from Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, Swiggy Instamart, and others. You\u2019d see all the discounts, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times in one place, allowing you to make informed decisions and save money, just like you do when booking a hotel on Trivago.\n\nI\u2019m planning to build this app and would love feedback, suggestions, or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting.

Swiggy has looted me for the 3rd time with the same excuse.\n\nI have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay. When I place an instamart order, the app takes me to the bank otp screen, an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited. Even order history shows nothing, naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed, lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same. This has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if it's a tactic to inflate revenue\/sales.\n\nThe first time it happened I ignore it as an oversight on my part. \n\nThe second time, after 2 different drivers gave me the same items I contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldn't have accepted the items now we cant do anything.\n\nThe 3rd time (today) the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times. This time I made the drivers wait till I got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted Mr that if I raise a chat ticket, they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money. So, I let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said \" Sorry sir you accepted the order so now I can't give you any refund\". I am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that I was falling in the same situation. I have written an email to instamart support but I really think I'm done with this app.\n\nAttaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is.\n\nWonder if anyone else has gone through this.","32":"Swiggy instamart in vellore\ud83e\udd73 Finally a quick delivery app working in vellore,  and has paan corner too \ud83d\ude43.","33":"Team of App Developers Required!!

For many of us, AmazonPay ICICI gets rejected upon application. \n\nThere is one way where you will most probably be successful in getting the card:\n\n- *Get any card from ICICI* :\nI had HPCL Super Saver that I got from college, but you can try getting either Sapphiro LTF through Alumni Offer, if you are a graduate from a top university, or otherwise get a basic ICICI Platinum Credit Card)\n- Now, go to Amazon app. Make sure your Amazon account has the same phone number as your ICICI account\/credit card, and have a decent shopping history on Amazon through that account. Email ID can be different, it's okay. Being a Prime Member is an advantage.\n- Activate AmazonPay Wallet with Full KYC, so that you have good limit. (This will also ensure that you actually get your cashback in this wallet every month)\n- Now, Wait for 3-6 months, keep checking your iMobile Pay app every month. \n- Mostly, you will get an offer to generate a Lifetime Free Coral RuPay Card. This means you have a significant banking history with ICICI Bank, such that the bank is ready to give you more cards on a shared limit. \n- Now, go to Amazon and Apply for the Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card \n- Once it asks you for OTP on SMS, if it asks you to enter your existing ICICI card's last 4 digits, _et viola_, you're in! \n- Give them the basic details (they won't ask you anything much, no kyc, no salary details, nothing, as the bank got it all from you when you applied for the first card)\n- Your AmazonPay ICICI Credit Card will get generated in the next hour, and you can get it delivered in post within a week depending on your location and the speed of Blue Dart.\n- This didn't create a cibil enquiry as this newly generated card will share your existing limit!\n- Might as well generate the Coral RuPay card later if you don't have an LTF RuPay card and your usage is minimal... \n\nDo note, the issuance of AmazonPay ICICI card also depends on Pincode and other factors, but this is the easiest way to get this card.\n\nHowever, even after all this, you don't get this card, there are alternative cards, that ofcourse restrict the cashback categories and the amount monthly. \n\n1) SBI Cashback (999+GST) - 5% upto 5k every month on almost all online websites. \n2) HDFC Millenia (999+GST) - 5% upto 1k every month on top websites & apps, 5% upto 1k every month on SmartBuy, 1% on all purchases upto 1k every month. \n3) HDFC Swiggy (499+GST) - 10% upto 1500 on all swiggy transactions (incl. instamart), 5% upto 1500 on top website\/apps, and 1% upto 500 on all other spends, but the cashback is in form of Swiggy Money ","37":"Swiggy app shows I can get LTF card, but bank says I cant.

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","44":"Quick Commerce: The Good, the Bad, and the Crowded \ud83d\udef5 So, I\u2019ve been hooked on this whole quick commerce (q-commerce) thing lately\u2014basically, apps like Blinkit, Zepto, or Instamart that deliver stuff faster than it takes me to find my shoes. Forgot milk for your coffee? Bam, it\u2019s at your door. Midnight froyo craving? Done. It\u2019s like glamping for your grocery shopping\u2014convenient but kinda extra.\n\nHere\u2019s the tea:\n\nThe Pros (AKA Awesomesauce Moments)\n\n1. Convenience Supreme: Need it now? You got it. No more last-minute dashes to the store.\n\n\n2. Techie Vibes: The whole \u201cdark store\u201d concept and how it all runs like clockwork is kinda fascinating.\n\n\n3. Staycation Ready: Perfect for days when you\u2019re too lazy to even think about leaving the house.\n\n\n\nThe Cons (AKA Side-Eye Material)\n\n1. Crowded Space: Everyone and their dog seems to be launching a q-commerce app. The competition is wild.\n\n\n2. Labor Drama: The rush to deliver in 10 minutes? Not so fun for the folks on bikes or scooters braving traffic.\n\n\n3. Impulse Traps: Did I need that second round of snacks? Nope, but here we are.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cool and all, but I\u2019m wondering if this is just another hellacious trend in the retail race or something that\u2019s actually here to stay. Plus, with everyone jumping in, it feels like the market is a little overcrowded.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? Is q-commerce your go-to lifesaver, or does it make you wanna photobomb its hype?

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform.

The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants, raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n___\n\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce, emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against ReviewServiceUSA.com for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants**,** raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","78":"Online Grocery Store  I am Located near CHIL SEZ IT park no Blinkit or Instamart or Zepto! Atlast I found Licious is delivering the meat, any local app?","80":"SWIGGY INSTAMART delivered items with HARPIC BLEACH all over them ! WARNING AGAINST USING SWIGGY INSTAMART, AND RANT (posting on behalf of a friend in her words) : \n31F booked an order on SWIGGY INSTAMART for several house hold items and FOOD products today for Rs. 2400. Even added a tip for the delivery agent. \n\nI had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofa's armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately. Just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where I unpack groceries, I started to faintly smell BLEACH (Harpic). \n\nI was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as I cut open the top of the bag. Delivery agent was gone by then. There was light\/no wetness on items at the top, but the more I got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items. The bleach smell from the Harpic Bleach (white bottles) fumes I had ordered was very strong, even burning my eyes slightly at this point. \n\n\nI took pictures and sent it on Swiggy Instamart chat. There is a pool of bleach at the bottom. There is even a picture where I lifted the bag up and there's so much bleach on the kitchen counter !!! It leaked through the bag\/holes in it!!\nSWIGGY INSTAMART COMPLEYELY REFUSED TO REPLACE\/REFUND\/EXCHANGE ! \n\n\nMy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point. Checked and found that the spot on my sofa's armrest where I put the bag down while taking the delivery was SOAKED in bleach ! I started to panic-clean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that we're not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical. \n\n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\n\nI offered several solutions : \n1. REVERSE PICKUP ALL ITEMS AND GIVE ME A FULL REFUND. Gurmeet Kaur (supervisor) refused. Why ?? \n2. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OK FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL ITEMS AND REPLACE IT WITH A FRESH ORDER. They didn't even want to speak about solutioning this ! \n3. I asked for an exchange\/full refund of all food products atleast, since bleach can literally hospitalize\/kill you ! She REFUSED !! I had sent 5-7 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said I need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it. I told her you can't see wetness on all products unless it's dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help ???  And I had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and we're getting exposed to it. \n4. Even if there's a chance few other items didn't make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach. Bleach FUMES are enough to contaminate any thing. I would not risk mine or anybody's health by allowing them to eat these items. Basic common sense. I had bought snacks for visiting kids today. But she refused to agree there was even a problem here !! \n5. Not only do I have to throw several of the items I ordered cause they are no longer safe, I also have to clean my counter tops, get rid of all exposed items\/bags into sealed clean bags, I also need to clean my sofa !! I don't even know how to remove bleach from a sofa !! Not to mention bleach will discolour clothes\/fabric !! It's a dark coloured sofa ! \n\n\nSwiggy thinks it's safe for their customers to use\/eat products from the same bag as leaking bleach ! They took zero responsibility for wasting my time, effort (ordering, waiting for delivery, talking to them on chat\/call, and CLEANING THE MESS AND HEALTH HAZARD they caused), my WASTED MONEY or for potentially compromising the health of others like this ! Are these their company's quality of service, standards and principles ??\n\n\nNote - I understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery I easily spend about Rs. 14,000-17,000 per month on their app for years now, very rarely raising issues. \n\n\nLessons learned\/For everybody reading this, \n1. Please don't order toxic or harmful substances like Harpic\/bathroom or toilet cleaners, floor cleaners, drain cleaners, naphthalene balls, dishwashing liquids, etc from SWIGGY INSTAMART since they use flimsy, non-leak proof bags, and don't segregate food items from chemical items while delivering. I will only order groceries from BigBasket from now onwards.\n2. Atleast order food items and other things in SEPERATE ORDERS.\n3. Check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since SWIGGY INSTAMART WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN CASE OF COMPROMISED PRODUCTS.\n4. Take pictures, videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system, or for social media. \n\n\nAm I being unreasonable expecting Swiggy to take responsibility here ? It shocks me that they didn't take any actions to correct such a health hazard ! \nPictures attached (zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom)","81":"Need suggestions  Hi guys, any app\/services available in Guwahati that delivers grocery items within a day\/few hours? I am using Bigbasket (the same day delivery option is not available in my area) and Swiggy instamart is not available here. Pls suggest","82":"Where to get grocery in night! It\u2019s 3 am and I urgently need some groceries\u2026 but instamart and blinkit both dont do delivery in night\u2026 so any other way or any other app..?  ","84":"Swiggy instamart delivered damaged headphones and not agreeing for replacement or refund I ordered pTronics bluetooth earbuds from swiggy instamart two days ago. I'm residing in Hyderabad . They delivered a damaged product. The right earbud is not even turning on. I contacted them via the chat option in the app and they asked me to send video proof of the product to an email id they provided. I took the video and mailed it to them. first they said that they are not seeing any orders from my number or registration email. then I sent them the screenshots as proof of me using the same number and email to order the earbuds. now they are saying that they cannot replace or refund and the only thing that they can do is prevent such unforseen events from happening in the future. they are indirectly asking me to be content with the damaged product as they cannot refund or replace it. Please provide me advice on how to proceed with this. The nearest service centre for the earbuds is like 60 kms away and I don't have the time or the money to go there for this issue. ","85":"Swiggy Disabling Instamart for Swiggy One users I stay in Rai Durg area and swiggy instamart has been inaccessible\/unavailable on my app since few weeks. When I saw a instamart delivery in the apartment, I got really curious as to how the other person must have ordered. \nWent back home, checked on my brothers mobile and it was available. I logged out from my mobile and used my brother's ID which did not have a swiggy one membership and voila, instamart was miraculously delivering to my home. \nTo make things sure, I logged in with my ID on brothers mobile and no instamart services. \nSo now I am pretty sure swiggy is selectively disabling instamart services to Swiggy one subscribers, what a bunch of cheating pricks. I wish I had the time and liberty to sue these guys in court. ","86":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 29th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ShopifyeCommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...  \n___\n\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n\n___\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce (formerly Woo, formerly WooCommerce), emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against [ReviewServiceUSA.com](http:\/\/ReviewServiceUSA.com) for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate [Alibaba.com](http:\/\/Alibaba.com), the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\n hope you found this recap helpful.

My inhand monthly salary is 1.55-1.6LPM.\nMy major monthly expenses are Zomato\/Swiggy deliveries, Uber, dining out at bars\/restaurants, grocery\/snacks\/cigarette purchases on Blinkit or Swiggy Instamart (either, depending on if one card gives better benefits on a certain app), online shopping at portals like Nykaa, Zara, H&M, Amazon(this is not that frequent).

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

No instamart, no zepto,  Bigbasket takes 1day, no blinkit, Amazon asks for at least 250 and still takes 1 day. So is there any app for instant grocery delivery?","92":"How different are your experiences on Swiggy and Zomato? On the restaurant app, their seller support, etc.? As a customer their app doesn't feel very differentiated to me. If either of them do something new the other also soon gets there. Discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time. (Right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on Zomato and I don't think those are available in every city).\n\nBut what about their restaurant app and their support services? Are their restaurant services significantly different? I'm sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts, depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants? Or are they pretty similar there as well? ","93":"Shall I go For HSBC Cashback Card Guys, I am a CC lover. Love to research and learn about cards and how to use them to maximise the benefit.\nRight now, I have HDFC millenia and Airtel axis card which covers 5% cashbacks for major online purchase and utility bill payments through axis. The spend where I don't get cashbacks was other online merchants which millenia doesn't not give and some online grocery stores like zepto, instamart. \nWas thinking how to cover those. I am confused between SBI cashback and hsbc. \nSBI cashback is really great option, but using park+ app, I am afraid it may devalue in coming time.. and then the card benefits would just be straight 5%. \nAs for hsbc it would cover only my grocery needs, but could be a good option if I want to cover those.\n\nAnyone experienced in this sub, please tell me which one should I go for..?\nIn short I want to cover all merchants to atleast get some value while purchasing\ud83e\udd23","94":"Consistently defrauded by Swiggy Instamart, Consumer Complaint prudent? TLDR: Frustrated of being defrauded by Swiggy Instamart of substandard and underweight produce. Their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices. will a consumer courts complaint help me get what I paid for?\n\nFeel cheated every time I order from Swiggy Instamart for the sake of convivence, Mutiple times They have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce, supplied to them on their store by third party vendors. Moreover, they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat. they ask you to email them proofs (to save server costs) and when supported by photo\/video evidence they dismiss the issue by stating, they are unable to \" validate\" my claims and refuse to replace even, forget refunding.  \n\n\nEvery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items, where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up.   \nHow is it that I have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check, it's like i am paying to give my feedback every time. Nothing changes and they continue on their merry way.    \n\n\nI am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if I am luck. I understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks, but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense.   \n\n\nA simple transaction of getting what I paid for as consumer shouldn't be such a gamble, Swiggy Instamart feels like a micro-gambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to \"the (un) concerned team\" and a take home a promise to of it being \" never repeated again in the future\".  \n\n\nI have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months.   On principle, i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company.  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers, it not a small amount. I wish we had class action lawsuits in our country.   \n1. Is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on National Consumer helpline portal online?  \n2. will my emails to Swiggy's Customer care team be considered as a legal notice, wherein I've mentioned it to be considered as such?","97":"Need advice regarding Swiggy HDFC CC  I have got a ltf offer for the swiggy HDFC card through the app recently. \n\nShould I take the card as this would be my first HDFC CC and I had read in some of the posts that a co-branded card is not be taken as one's first HDFC card.\n\nAlso my swiggy spends are not humongous and I am just considering this card as a good to have for the 5% cashback offer as I don't have the SBI cashback cc (And for use it maybe 2-3 times a month for groceries on instamart). \nAnother factor for me to consider this card is because they have now updated their T&C to subtract the cashback from the monthly statement instead of giving it in the swiggy wallet.\n\nAlso is this card excluded from online stores during sales\/offers pertaining to HDFC cc offers (for ex : Big billion days, Apple days etc)?","98":"Has anyone encountered grocery shopping difference by hand and by app? I tend to forget what i bought from app. Whereas if i shop i usually recall most of it.  Lately ive realised that whenever i shop my grocery i remember most of it. Because when hungry or prep food i quickly calculate what i can make. Whereas for app purchase from blinkit or instamart i find it hard to recall the grocery itself . Is it me or someone has feel same?","99":"Honest mistake, need a solution So, my grandmother generally uses rapido services to commute to relatives house once in a while. In December 2023 she used it for 4 times in that 2 times she paid using Simpl pay by mistake, what happened was the fare was paid by simpl which she did not realize as there was no OTP verification for the payment, so as usually she paid in cash (UPI) as well. Fare was 536rs (stayed the same till the end) and 94rs which got deducted by the time of reaching the destination to 71rs.\n\nIn Jan 2024 they have called her to remind to pay back the money, already there has been an interest added to the sum twice by that time. She told me that she never signed up for simpl pay service and also there was no OTP verification to go through with the payment. So i logged into simpl app using her mobile number and got to know that the account has been activate in 2022 itself as there was a transaction to swiggy instamart.\n\nSo I contacted the Rapido support and informed them what happened with screenshots of transctions. They have called back and said we will initiate the rufund and closed the call but they have only refunded 200rs of 536rs fare and 71rs of 94rs(simpl actually paid 94rs to the driver) , these got reflected in simpl pay statement. contacted them again with the issue and they said that they can only refund upto 200rs, I started an argument after that they said they will refund the rest of the money as well and closed the call. There has been no message regarding the refund from simpl and the statement. Contacted simpl regarding the issue to confirm if they have received a rest of the refund if not please call me back which they never did and keep rotating the same statement to be paid instead of addressing my query. Rapido keeps saying that they have done the full refund from their end, I asked for some sort of confirmation as I did not receive any notification, message or email validating the refund. No reply\n\nNow it has been a while and Simpl pay has been sending mails like we have initiated a legal notice from an advocate and stuff.\n\nCan someone help with a legal advice.\n\n&#x200B;","100":"Swiggy instamart problem Don't know where to post this, so let me know if this is the worng group.\n\nI ordered some facewash from Swiggy instamart. When the product arrived, it had offer Buy 1 Get 1 Free printed on it in huge font.\nSo the first thought I had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 50-60% of the product cost, like most of the local shopkeepers do for BOGO. But no, what I paid on swiggy was 90% of the product cost but didn't get the fee product with it. \n\nWhen I contacted support and asked for 50% refund of the product cost or the free product, they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app.\n\nDon't you guys think it's kinda like doing fraud with the customer.\n","101":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.

power bank on instamart on 4th dec \nafter charging my 4500 mah phone two times the battery has drained to one led light which indicates battery level to be 0 to 25\ni ordered from insta mart because it said there is a 4 day return window and in case of anything we can get it replaced today is only day 2 and when i raised a request on their app i was not able to get to the point where i swiggy offers to talk to a customer executive\ni was instead cut off with bot replies asking me to email them will be attaching screenshots below \n\nonce i email them i got a reply saying they are sad that neither refund or replacement can be done\nno reason is mentioned as to why\nim not able to raise further requests on the app also\nthen i tried instagram and i one shit reply saying my feedback is forwarded \nhow is this feedback im saying my product is defective and this is the reply\ni think they have closed their call services also\n\nnow as i was writing i got a reply on instagram asking me to contact the seller \nwhy i am well within the 4 day replacement time frame so why should i contact the seller\n\nim planning to take this up to the officals if they intend to continue giving me baseless irrelevant shady replies  ordering a power bank through swiggy not sure what to say\nits not a scam i think the powerbank is working fine if you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left it is fine\n20k mah powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure thats all\nlet me see if i can explain this\nsee what is the voltage of your powerbank these are normally 37 v so the total wattage is 37 v  20000 mah  37 v  20 ah  74 wh\n\nphones operate at 5 v so a single full charge of the phone need wattage  5 v  4500 mah  5 v  45 ah  225 wh\n\nso number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank  74  225  328 times considering 1015 wastage you will be able to charge it around 28 times so after 2 charges if it is having some more charge then i think that the powerbank is fine you are expecting too much from the powerbank you can buy another powerbank from amazon  flipkart but you will probably get similar results\nwhat were your expectations though\nits not a scam its working as expected i think you are misunderstanding how pb works as many comments have corrected your expectations","9":"new zepto workflow scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery

offer advice i was approved for the card in july but since then i havent received the correct cashback based on the cards cashback policy ive raised the issue multiple times but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution\n\nhere are the details\n\nfirst month i spent about 2500 on swiggy but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountbut based on my calculations i should have received 640\n\nswiggy transactions issue some swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as instamart orders which likely use a different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed not everythings a scam dude its kind of normal even when the cashback credited is lower than expected they credit it in later statements\n\n\n\nscreenshot from my expense management app look at the entries with additional cashback  monthyear\n\ncashback would get credited in statement as cashback  monthyear additionalmissing cashback as additional cashback  monthyear\n\nif you notice sometimes additional cashback came months after the statement date\n\nedit seems this post is for the rupay variant i cant say whats up with that\nhey this happened the first two months with me too i kept raising complaints and not talking to the first level of customer care but escalating to the next one eventually they corrected it after almost two months i checked for transactions for 3 months since and it was all okay i havent checked again for the last 6 months and now i feel like i should check again\ndude\n\nbeen facing the same issue i have called and emailed customer care multiple times yet a resolution has not been reached service requests have been raised till now\n\nreally frustrating and disappointing experience i thought i was the only one facing this problem\nput on the email here brothers i guess i am gonna need it coz after watching this i will have to calculate mine as well\nthis is an issue with swiggy

tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom","21":"new zepto scam is this a

myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to

avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when

transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can do it and using ai could even make

you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with inapp payments\n\t\tproduct quality\n\nits a simple idea but i think it could really work if executed well","27":"finally swiggy instamart is in belgaum updated my swiggy app today and finally shows instamarr delivery at tilakwadi 590006 location i prayed for times like this \n fantasizing

i dont know how to feel right now swiggy has looted me for the 3rd time with the same excuse\n\ni have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay when i place an instamart order the app takes me to the bank otp screen an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited even order history shows nothing naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same this has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if its a tactic to inflate revenuesales\n\nthe first time it happened i ignore it as an oversight on my part \n\nthe second time after 2 different drivers gave me the same items i contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldnt have accepted the items now we cant do anything\n\nthe 3rd time today the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times this time i made the drivers wait till i got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted mr that if i raise a chat ticket they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money so i let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said  sorry sir you accepted the order so now i cant give you any refund i am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that i was falling in the same situation i have written an email to instamart support but i really think im done with this app\n\nattaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is\n\nwonder if anyone else has gone through this rwildlyinfuriating\nfile a chargeback with hdfc\nzomato did the same a while ago \nthey now handle the customer complaints over email\nuninstalled

most probably be successful in getting the card\n\n get any card from icici \ni had hpcl super saver that i got from college but you can try getting either sapphiro ltf through alumni offer if you are a graduate from a top university or otherwise get a basic icici platinum credit card\n now go to amazon app make sure your amazon account has the same phone number as your icici accountcredit card and have a decent shopping history on amazon through that account email id can be different its okay being a prime member is an advantage\n activate amazonpay wallet with full kyc so that you have good limit this will also ensure that you actually get your cashback in this wallet every month\n now wait for 36 months keep checking your imobile pay app every month \n mostly you will get an offer to generate a lifetime free coral rupay card this means you have a significant banking history with icici bank such that the bank is ready to give you more cards on a shared limit \n now go to amazon and apply for the amazon pay icici credit card \n once it asks you for otp on sms if it asks you to enter your existing icici cards last 4 digits et viola youre in \n give them the basic details they wont ask you anything much no kyc no salary details nothing as the bank got it all from you when you applied for the first card\n your amazonpay icici credit card will get generated in the next hour and you can get it delivered in post within a week depending on your location and the speed of blue dart\n this didnt create a cibil enquiry as this newly generated card will share your existing limit\n might as well generate the coral rupay card later if you dont have an ltf rupay card and your usage is minimal \n\ndo note the issuance of amazonpay icici card also depends on pincode and other factors but this is the easiest way to get this card\n\nhowever even after all this you dont get this card there are alternative cards that ofcourse restrict the cashback categories and the amount

from that dark store ends up being 4 mins but actually takes 10  15 mins which includes the delivery person most of the times calling me inspite of the address being very clear along with hard to miss landmarks right on the main road \n\n\nbut because they use some kinda radius which they consider to change the status of delivery person as arrived at the location the order is always marked as arrived at my location even before it leaves the dark store potentially as soon as its packed \n\n\ni dont really mind the order coming in 10  15 mins or even more than that also it only gets marked as delivered after the order is in my hand so that not an issue but the time it considers is that initial 23 mins\n\n\nsuch metrics can and are definitely skewing the overall statistics they

words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom ","81":"need suggestions  hi guys any appservices available in guwahati that delivers grocery items within a

event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount

into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the

250 and still takes 1 day so is there any app for instant grocery delivery swiggy genie is the closest one here my friend started an app for instant grocery delivery but it didnt succeed many supermarkets local ones do delivery for free try checking with them\nswiggy has heard you mate\nbut amazon fresh has same day delivery\ntry docile 10 minute delivery app just saw a reel promoting them on insta\nthey recently started swiggy instamart so u can try that","92":"how different are your experiences on swiggy and zomato on the restaurant app their seller support etc as a customer their app doesnt feel very differentiated to me if either of them do something new the other also soon gets there discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on zomato and i dont think those are available in every city\n\nbut what about their restaurant app and their support services are their restaurant services significantly different im sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants or are they pretty similar there as well  things as basic as changing riders for orders at swiggy are a nightmare they simply cannot change riders for an order unless the rider himselfherself gets that done \n\ndiscounts are a burden at this stage you cannot do without them but you also cannot do with them \n\ninflation takes away a bigger chunk from our pockets every year","93":"shall i go for hsbc cashback card guys i am a cc lover love to research and learn about cards and how to use them to maximise the benefit\nright now i have hdfc millenia and airtel axis card which covers 5 cashbacks for major online purchase and utility bill payments through axis the spend where i dont get cashbacks was other online merchants which millenia doesnt not give and some online grocery stores like zepto instamart \nwas thinking how to cover those i am confused between sbi cashback and hsbc \nsbi cashback is really great option but using park app i am afraid it may devalue in coming time and then the card benefits would just be straight 5 \nas for hsbc it would cover only my grocery needs but could be a good option if i want to cover those\n\nanyone experienced in this sub please tell me which one should i go for\nin short i want to cover all merchants to atleast get some value while purchasing\ud83e\udd23 get both via cashkaro app youll get the joining fees back at least also i think hsbc gives out apay vouchers as well\n\ndoesnt hurt getting these 2 cards for 2k \n\nyou also get airport lounge access with hsbc as well\n2 totally different cards mate sbi cashback is better than millennia but if you hv millennia ltf then thats it u dont need sbi no point having both keep what u hv or close one and get the other ur call unless u r maxing out your card benefits which i think is very unlikely\n\nhsbc cashback makes 100 sense for u if u like me spend more offline and that too mostly on food n groceries only thing r u living in a metro coz only limited pincodes are covered","94":"consistently defrauded by swiggy instamart consumer complaint prudent tldr frustrated of being defrauded by swiggy instamart of substandard and underweight produce their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices will a consumer courts complaint help me get what i paid for\n\nfeel cheated every time i order from swiggy instamart for the sake of convivence mutiple times they have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense   \n\n\na simple transaction of getting what i paid for as consumer shouldnt be such a gamble swiggy instamart feels like a microgambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to the un concerned team and a take home a promise to of it being  never repeated again in the future  \n\n\ni have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months   on principle i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers it not a small amount i wish we had class action lawsuits in our country   \n1 is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on national consumer helpline portal online  \n2 will my emails to swiggys customer care team be considered as a legal notice wherein ive mentioned it to be considered as such wow such empty much first world problem\nop any update \nhi op i just faced the same issue in my case the product was half eaten \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ni recently had a horrible experience with instamarts customer care service and this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies i had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire rooms electrical input when i plugged it in the rest of the house was fine \n\ni ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no fault of my own their responses were flat validations\n\ni then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if i were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that\n\nand i have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund\nunfortunately i am in a city where only instamart is available if not i always avoid them\n\nthis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable\ni dont know but i use blinkit as instamart isnt available in my city and blink its support is good","97":"need advice regarding swiggy hdfc cc  i have got a ltf offer for the swiggy hdfc card through the app recently \n\nshould i take the card as this would be my first hdfc cc and i had read in some of the posts that a cobranded card is not be taken as ones first hdfc card\n\nalso my swiggy spends are not humongous and i am just considering this card as a good to have for the 5 cashback offer as i dont have the sbi cashback cc and for use it maybe 23 times a month for groceries on instamart \nanother factor for me to consider this card is because they have now updated their tc to subtract the cashback from the monthly statement instead of giving it in the swiggy wallet\n\nalso is this card excluded from online stores during salesoffers pertaining to hdfc cc offers for ex  big billion days apple days etc ","98":"has anyone encountered grocery shopping difference by hand and by app i tend to forget what i bought from app whereas if i shop i usually recall most of it  lately ive realised that whenever i shop my grocery i remember most of it because when hungry or prep food i quickly calculate what i can make whereas for app purchase from blinkit or instamart i find it hard to recall the grocery itself  is it me or someone has feel same ","99":"honest mistake need a solution so my grandmother generally uses rapido services to commute to relatives house once in a while in december 2023 she used it for 4 times in that 2 times she paid

them what happened with screenshots of transctions they have called back and said we will initiate the rufund and closed the call but they have only refunded 200rs of 536rs fare and 71rs of 94rssimpl actually paid 94rs to the driver  these got reflected in simpl pay statement contacted them again with the issue and they said that they can only refund upto 200rs i started an argument after that they said they will refund the rest of the money as well and closed the call there has been no message regarding the refund from simpl and the statement contacted simpl regarding the issue to confirm if they have received a rest of the refund if not please call me back which they never did and keep rotating the same statement to be paid instead of addressing my query rapido keeps saying that they have done the full refund from their end i asked for some sort of confirmation as i did not receive any notification message or email validating the refund no reply\n\nnow it has been a while and simpl pay has been sending mails like we have initiated a legal notice from an advocate and stuff\n\ncan someone help with a legal advice\n\nx200b forget the refund from them and also ignore their threats \nboth are just not happening","100":"swiggy instamart problem dont know where to post this so let me know if this is the worng group\n\ni ordered some facewash from swiggy instamart when the product arrived it had offer buy 1 get 1 free printed on it in huge font\nso the first thought i had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 5060 of the product cost like most of the local shopkeepers do for bogo but no what i paid on swiggy was 90 of the product cost but didnt get the fee product with it \n\nwhen i contacted support and asked for 50 refund of the product cost or the free product they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app\n\ndont you guys think its kinda like doing fraud with the customer\n ","101":"swiggy scams  charging higher and other issues  hey guys\nthis is for general awareness ive been using both zomato and swiggy for a long time \n\n1 product charges are higher on swiggy than on zomato delivery fee is higher heres the kicker  im a swiggy one member the same sandwich costs 250 on zomato and 270 on swiggy total ended up being higher by rs 60 this happens so much with every order that i dont even need to check with swiggy app now swiggy overcharging is a delhi thing i spoke to a few friends in other city and they dont face this issue \n\nyoure better off comparing with swiggy and zomato \n\n2 instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than blinkit as well a lot of times not always \n\n3 instamart changes final billorder on the app this has happened to me and my friends we placed order for x received y checked app and app showed that order was placed for y not x after this happened a couple times we started to take screenshots asap after placing order it happened again but this time we had proof complained but nothing happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i havent used instamart a lot in these months\n\nthats all please take this as my opinion check for yourself when making purchases  \n\nhope this helps in some way   this thread is flaired as serious

full refund so i asked for a coupon for my remaining amount ie 184rs but theyre saying thats not possible either i have been a loyal premium user of swiggy since years yet theyre being an ass  they

\nafter charging my 4500 mah phone two times the battery has drained to one led light which indicates battery level to be 0 to 25\ni ordered from insta mart because it said there is a 4 day return window and in case of anything we can get it replaced today is only day 2 and when i raised a request on their app i was not able to get to the point where i swiggy offers to talk to a customer executive\ni was instead cut off with bot replies asking me to email them will be attaching screenshots below \n\nonce i email them i got a reply saying they are sad that neither refund or replacement can be done\nno reason is mentioned as to why\nim not able to raise further requests on the app also\nthen i tried instagram and i one shit reply saying my feedback is forwarded \nhow is this feedback im saying my product is defective and this is the reply\ni think they have closed their call services also\n\nnow as i was writing i got a reply on instagram asking me to contact the seller \nwhy i am well within the 4 day replacement time frame so why should i contact the seller\n\nim planning to take this up to the officals if they intend to continue giving me baseless irrelevant shady replies  ordering a power bank through swiggy not sure what to say\nits not a scam i think the powerbank is working fine if you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left it is fine\n20k mah powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure thats all\nlet me see if i can explain this\nsee what is the voltage of your powerbank these are normally 37 v so the total wattage is 37 v  20000 mah  37 v  20 ah  74 wh\n\nphones operate at 5 v so a single full charge of the phone need wattage  5 v  4500 mah  5 v  45 ah  225 wh\n\nso number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank  74  225  328 times considering 1015 wastage you will be able to charge it around 28 times so after 2 charges if it is having some more charge then i think that the powerbank is fine you are expecting too much from the powerbank you can buy another powerbank from amazon  flipkart but you will probably get similar results\nwhat were your expectations though\nits not a scam its working as expected i think you are

with my airtel axis credit card and wanted to see if anyone here has faced something similar or could offer advice i was approved for the card in july but since then i havent received the correct cashback based on the cards cashback policy ive raised the issue multiple times but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution\n\nhere are the details\n\nfirst month i spent about 2500 on swiggy but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountbut based on my calculations i should have received 640\n\nswiggy transactions issue some swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as instamart orders which likely use a different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed not everythings a scam dude its kind of normal even when the cashback credited is lower than expected they credit it in later statements\n\n\n\nscreenshot from my expense management app look at the entries with additional cashback  monthyear\n\ncashback would get credited in statement as cashback  monthyear additionalmissing cashback as additional cashback  monthyear\n\nif you notice sometimes additional

complaints and not talking to the first level of customer care but escalating to the next one eventually they corrected it after almost two months i checked for transactions for 3 months since and it was all okay i havent checked again for the last 6 months and now i feel like i should check again\ndude\n\nbeen facing the same issue i have called and emailed customer care multiple times yet a

i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom"}]],"21":[[{"negative":0.7942970991,"neutral":0.1221475303,"positive":0.0835554004,"aspect":"instamart","text":"new zepto scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the

trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me

you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare

food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with

guys for many of us amazonpay icici gets rejected upon application \n\nthere is one way where you will most probably be successful in getting the card\n\n get any card from icici \ni had hpcl super saver that i got from college but you can try getting either sapphiro ltf through alumni offer if you are a graduate from a top university or otherwise get a basic icici platinum credit card\n now go to amazon app make sure your amazon account has the same phone number as your icici accountcredit card and have a decent shopping history on amazon through that account email id can be different its okay being a prime member is an advantage\n activate amazonpay wallet with full kyc so that you have good limit this will also ensure that you actually get your cashback in this wallet every month\n now wait for 36 months keep checking your imobile pay app every month \n mostly you will get an offer to generate a lifetime free coral rupay card this means you have a significant banking history with icici bank such that the bank is ready to give you more cards on a shared limit \n now go to amazon and apply for the amazon pay icici credit card \n once it asks you for otp on sms if it asks you to enter your existing icici cards last 4 digits et viola youre in \n give them the basic details they wont ask you anything much no kyc no salary details nothing as the bank got it all from you when you applied for the first card\n your amazonpay icici credit card will get generated in the next hour and you can get it delivered in post within a week depending on your location and the speed of blue dart\n this didnt create a cibil enquiry as this newly generated card will share your existing limit\n might as well generate the coral rupay card later if you dont have an ltf rupay card and your usage is minimal \n\ndo note the issuance of amazonpay icici card also depends on pincode and other factors but this is the easiest way to get this card\n\nhowever even after all this you dont get this card there are alternative cards that ofcourse restrict the cashback categories and the amount monthly \n\n1 sbi cashback 999gst  5 upto 5k every month on almost all online websites \n2 hdfc

against using swiggy instamart and rant posting on behalf of a friend in her words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching

\n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time

these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom

considered as a legal notice wherein ive mentioned it to be considered as such wow such empty much first world problem\nop any update \nhi op i just faced the same issue in my case the product was half eaten \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ni recently had a horrible experience with instamarts customer care service and this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies i had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire rooms electrical input when i plugged it in the rest of the house was fine \n\ni ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no fault of my own their responses were flat validations\n\ni then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if i were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that\n\nand i have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund\nunfortunately i am in a city where only instamart is available if not i always avoid them\n\nthis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable\ni dont know but i use blinkit as instamart isnt available in my city and blink its support is good"}]],"97":[[{"negative":0.0080812443,"neutral":0.9674953818,"positive":0.0244232956,"aspect":"instamart","text":"need advice regarding swiggy hdfc cc  i have got a ltf offer for the swiggy hdfc card through the app recently \n\nshould i take the card as this would be my first hdfc cc and i had read in some of the posts that a cobranded card is not be taken as ones first hdfc card\n\nalso my swiggy spends are not humongous and i am just considering this card as a good to have for the 5 cashback offer as i dont have the sbi cashback cc and for use it maybe 23 times a month for groceries on instamart \nanother factor for me to consider this card is because they have now updated their tc to subtract the cashback from the monthly statement instead of giving it in the swiggy wallet\n\nalso is this card excluded from online stores during salesoffers pertaining to hdfc cc offers for ex  big billion days apple days etc

commute to relatives house once in a while in december 2023 she used it for 4 times in that 2 times she paid using simpl pay by mistake what happened was the fare was paid by simpl which she did not realize as there was no otp verification for the payment so as usually she paid in cash upi as well fare was 536rs stayed the same till the end and 94rs which got deducted by the time of reaching the destination to 71rs\n\nin jan 2024 they have called her to remind to pay back the money already there has been an interest added to the sum twice by that time she told me that she never signed up for simpl pay service and also there was no otp verification to go through with the payment so i logged into simpl app using her mobile number and got to know that the account has been activate in 2022 itself as there was a transaction to swiggy instamart\n\nso i contacted the rapido support and informed them what happened with screenshots of transctions they have called back and said we will initiate the rufund and closed the call but they have only refunded 200rs of 536rs fare and 71rs of 94rssimpl actually paid 94rs to the driver  these got reflected in simpl pay statement contacted them again with the issue and they said that they can only refund upto 200rs i started an argument after that they said they will refund the rest of the money as well and closed the call there has been no message regarding the refund from simpl and the statement contacted simpl regarding the issue to confirm if they have received a rest of the refund if not please call me back which they never did and keep rotating the same statement to be paid instead of addressing my query rapido keeps saying that they have done the full refund from their end i asked for some sort of confirmation as i did not receive any notification message or email validating the refund no reply\n\nnow it has been a while and simpl pay has been sending mails like we have initiated a legal notice from an advocate and stuff\n\ncan someone help with a legal advice\n\nx200b forget the refund from them and also ignore their threats \nboth are just not happening"}]],"100":[[{"negative":0.799265027,"neutral":0.1550040394,"positive":0.0457308404,"aspect":"instamart","text":"swiggy instamart problem dont know where to post this so let me know if this is the worng group\n\ni ordered some facewash from swiggy instamart when the product arrived it had offer buy 1 get 1 free printed on it in huge font\nso the first thought i had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 5060 of the product cost like most of the local shopkeepers do for bogo but no what i paid on swiggy was 90 of the product cost but didnt get the fee product with it \n\nwhen i contacted support and asked for 50 refund of the product cost or the free product they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app\n\ndont you guys think its kinda like doing fraud with the customer\n "}]],"101":[[{"negative":0.9538098574,"neutral":0.0288625397,"positive":0.0173275881,"aspect":"instamart","text":"swiggy scams

instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than blinkit as well a lot of times not always \n\n3 instamart changes final billorder on the app this has happened to me and my friends we placed order for x received y checked app and app showed that order was placed for y not x after this happened a couple times we started to take screenshots asap after placing order it happened again but this time we had proof complained but nothing happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i havent used instamart a lot in these
