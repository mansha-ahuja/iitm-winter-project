i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more","1":"i ordered for the first time from blinkit and when i went to take the other the delivery person asked to take a photo of me with the bag i opposed to it but he said its required as they have to upload it on the app or something at last they clicked a picture of package i thought i wasnt in the photo but now i think that the camera angle definitely got me i just want to know am i going to be kidnapped now while going out or is it a normal thing ","3":"good morning you all\n\nso the news is from zomato where shares have surged after blinkit hit a record high in orders prompting ubs to raise its price target to 320 from 260 this boost reflects growing confidence in zomatos market position and its potential for continued growth the stock jumped 6 to 280 marking a new 52week high analysts are optimistic about zomatos future driven by strong demand and strategic expansions in the food delivery sector","4":"so earlier amazon used to clearly demarcate if your order will be delivered by amazon fresh or amazon i have always had terrible experience with amazon fresh and hence never used to order from amazon fresh lately i have learnt that the so called rush delivery whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by amazon fresh\n\ntwice i opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so called rush deliveries are handled by amazon fresh i then realized why they were getting delayed amazon fresh has always been crap since day 1 the worst part is they wont even let you cancel an amazon fresh order even if it has not been dispatched \n\nso if you are ordering something from amazon never choose any of the time slots your order will be then handled by amazon fresh and you will be sorry you chose them\n\nas a side note always check the item on blinkit before ordering from amazon their sku has expanded significantly the order which was delayed by amazon fresh i checked it on blinkit and got it in 5 minutes meanwhile the original amazon order is now more than 36 hrs old and there is no option to cancel it on amazon i really wonder how they amazon fresh are still alive as a division","5":"a deloitte report estimates indian quick commerce to be a massive 40 bn market by 2030 some dominant grocery delivery models in india\ud83d\udc47\n\nindias quick commerce landscape in 2024 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 the rapid growth seen in the quick commerce business has compelled zomato to double down on blinkit it is looking to nearly double its store count by the end of fy25 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 mukesh ambaniled ril is close to launching its own quick commerce operations through jiomart  looking to deliver groceries in select cities in under 30 minutes and is likely to ramp up operations by next year \n\n\ud83d\udd38 reliance reportedly plans to take it to around 1000 cities in future and jiomart will tap into reliance retails network of over 18000 stores across the country\n\n\ud83d\udd38 that kind of scale would allow jiomart to potentially catapult the existing group of quick commerce apps  blinkit swiggys instamart and zepto  and also end the nascent ambitions of tataowned bigbasket and flipkart before they take off\n\n\ud83d\udd38 flipkart is fresh with funds from google and majority stakeholder walmart and is also likely to make a major push for grocery delivery where blinkit zepto and swiggy have created welloiled playbooks","6":"this may be grossly wrong but your critical comments are welcome below is table of orders process by blinkit taken from various sources\n\nwith 5l orders per day and value per order rs 640 gross order value per q in crs is rs 2880 crs against the company claim of 4950 cr\n\n\n\ngross order value per quarter in crores is far below the claim made by company value per order and orders per day are taken from economic times report and annual report but hings dont add up\n\nalso number of delivery partners and total deliveries in a day dont add up\n\non top of this cofounder of zomato is wife of blinkit ceo and she has resigned today further in 2 years the company turned from 1200 cr loss to 351 cr profit with the same business model and nominal increase in charges platform fee revenue is 180 cr only so that has not impacted profitability\n\nfor sure something big is cooking up as all the cofounders are leaving\n\nkindly share your views\n\n\n\n","8":"i was waiting for my towel order the entire fucking day i was looking forward to throwing away my useless towel from blinkit that keeps attaching little fibres on my body everytime

interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea

and understanding so posting my concern here  ive done a diploma in computer engineering but had to drop out from my b tech 2nd year due to some personal reasons i dont have any highpaying jobs since i have any skills that can get me a decent job but with some basic skills im making good enough to pay my bills currently im trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else and the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap\n\nhow i fall into a debt trap\u00a0i tried to be a nice guy in covid times and i helped my brotherlike best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black covid days but i never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life i helped him with all my savings and investments from stokes i was a fool and for the sake of friendship i helped him he never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates this stupidity made me fall into a 15x bigger debt trap than what i had helped him with other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap my dog met with an accident the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didnt give us deposit amount in return broker ran away with our money i met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine got scammed by someone worth of 10000 and still never got it back since the bank is sbi and we know how it works recently my 160 worth of crypto got stolen which i had received for completing tasks and that was literally my last money in hand  such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this\n\nwhats my current status\u00a0i was in total debt of 15 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me i called my father and told him about my situation i couldnt tell him everything because in a conversation over a call he thought that i was too stressed and might harm myself i didnt wanted to give him more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks everything is clear but its not i cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as i was capable of i worked as a blinkit delivery partner i worked for one youtuber and so on\n\nnow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only 90000 is what i need on urgent basis the rest amount is from some close people whore never gonna ask for it back but ill return it asap i save something\n\nwhats in that 90000\n\n16000\u00a0ring power loan  from instant loan app  overdue of 15 days and theyre constantly calling every 5 min and knocking on my door every day if i dont repay it tonight by 9 theyll reach my parents house in my hometown and that would be a disaster for my life my father will never talk to me again and my girlfriend who has supported me in this bad time i wont be able to marry without my parents permission i dont want to lose the love of my life and neither the respect of my parents just for a small amount of money\n\n13000  19000  13000\u00a0i had borrowed this from known people but as i promised them to pay last month i couldnt pay them and now theyre constantly calling me and want their money back i cant keep them ignoring or they might talk to any of my brothers or father about this yes i know im late and im really capable of paying them this amount instantly and theyre not ready to wait for a few days\n\nthe rest is small fractions of the amounts and that will take a very long paragraph to explain the story\n\nhow ill pay back\u00a0ive applied for the rapido captain job no matter what happens ill do my best to make 1500 a day from rapido it might sound hard but ive to do it and ill do it along with that ive a small work from one youtuber that pays me 9000 a month and a small source of income is affiliate income which can pay my daily bills so whatever ill earn from rapido and other gigs ill keep on paying it every week within 34 months ill surely clear this with whoever kindhearted person hear to help me\n\nmen can understand the pain and shame of asking for money from your father or someone else when youre all capable of earning writing this post makes me feel so guilty but if i had any other option i wouldnt be writing here right im all on my own im trying my best but the pressure of paying for everything on time and the stress of other stuff is not letting me focus on my learnings i dont

zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time ","29":"to give some context\n\ni graduated from college last year and have been working

insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the

about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and

shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the delivery guy as soon its out for delivery got the food this time still i didnt got my money back yet zomato\n\nive also used blinkit swiggy eatclub zepto it was my first time going through this has anyone faced the same recently if so have u got the refund at the least\nafter this i am unable to trust prepaid orders or zomato the same any

guys im practicing for system design interviews and created a hld for instamartblinkit please review it and suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n","41":"my idea is as follows\n\ngoal to deliver goodsurgent supplements within the city with reduced time and reduced delivery cost\n\n\u00a0\n\nthis can be done by using drones as follows\n\n1 when the agencyshopetc receive any order they will put the order in the drone baggage compartment\n2 the drone is automatically receives customer destination and how to reach there\n3 the path drone follows is the main usp for this total project\n4 the backend algorithm collabs with the ride apps such as uberola etc\n   1 the algorithm works as follows\n   2 the algorithms gets track of all the live rides going on with the ride appsref point4\n   3 then calculates the nearest point where drone can get on the vehicles participating in the live rides\n   4 the drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicleautocabetc to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top\n   5 during the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone\n      1 scenario 1 if vehicle stuck in traffic then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer\n      2 scenario 2 when vehicle is taking different route than the destination then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle\n\n\u00a0\n\n this method is useful in cases of emergencies medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time\n the business like zeptoblinkit can reduce their dark stores\n the delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part\n the complications happens from the drones can be reduced\n\ni hope i can get lot of insights from talented people out there","42":"of course tam is the most crucial aspect to assess before you invest your money and time in a venture in the unknown but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche yet in the grand scheme of things it can be a brilliant productservice users probably dont know they needed it but they do if its executed correctly\n\ni have been building a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading ","43":"how was the service are the fruits and vegetables are selected properly before delivery i want to try bigbasket

Kuch gadbad hai. \n\nI am soooo happy someone else also feels that there's something heavily wrong with Zomato. \n\nMein akele pagal nahi hoon\nEver since they posted \u201cadjusted EBIDTA\u201d I\u2019ve steered away from the company.\nAlso a huge chunk of their revenue comes from hyperpure. Have you factored in that? Thats around 27% of Zomato's total revenue.\nFor some reason, i have never not good vibes from deepinder goyal. Obv this is a random statement but over the years i have realised that our gut instinct is generally right!","8":"Yall, it's a vent. It's not like they said this to them. I'd be frustrated too. Nobody should be expected to wait the whole day at home  for a delivery. They went out at about 730 at night, they shouldn't be expected to wait the whole day. The delivery driver, instead of putting missed delivery  and instead put, didn't  accept which would probably get it sent back. Like people are allowed to let out their frustrations\nholy fuck man, fuck that fucking delivery driver, i fucking *hateeeeee* that kind of towel so muchhhhh\nYeah that delivery driver sucks. I\u2019d be mad too.\nGod, i'm sorry that this happened to you.\nAnd, honestly, people calling you a karen are just unbelievable and have not experienced anything like that.\nI totally feel you in the towel thing and was in a similar situation with a hairbrush(it was very bad, didn't brush my hair well because i got a lot of hair and it even had some of the things missing, there were also no other better in the malls or shops i went). In my case, my mom got a good one for me and didn't need to deliever anything, i used that hairbrush and i never felt so satisfied brushing my hair like that moment.\n\nWhat i'm saying is that i understand you, and that i, unlike some people, get your anger completely.\nI like this\u2026let it out bro\u2026","9":"Why would you want to leave your happy place ? \n\nYou are a citizen and have the option to move when it make sense to you, Canada has other cities and provinces though tech jobs and climate might not be to your liking. \n\nIf you have WFH options, look at the wider GTA areas where Indian communities have come up over the last few years. Good luck !\nSame experience here despite high paying job (make 6-7 times more than avg Canadian income, mid 6 digit). \nThere are racism undertones, lack of opportunities to progress further due to immigrant status, no culture (the multi-cultural claim is a boogie), no history except that they invaded First Nation lands and buried them, lack of innovation (tell me one company similar to apple, Google or Microsoft that was born jn Canada), \u201cfree\u201d healthcare is delayed, stressed out, and most people working in healthcare burnt out (I work directly in healthcare) and many times you may be denied certain important medicines because they are not \u201cprovincially\u201d funded and your extended healthcare coverage do not cover it (e.g., Weygovi, and several newer cancer drugs).\nMost public schools are subpar and you will have to fight with them so that your kids are not bullied or ignored because of their skin color. \n\nThe only business (or I may even call it scam) they do here is immigration- bring in young people who have bigger dreams, these young people then invest their time and money (read educational loans and mortgage) in this country so they usually can\u2019t go back, they then work hard to earn (because they have loans to pay back, right?), they pay higher taxes as they earn more but still get blamed for using up infrastructure and healthcare resources (research from Canada shows that immigrants have significantly lesser healthcare dollar usage compared to non-immigrants as they are younger and healthier when they immigrate but this fact is hidden from general public).\n\nJust yesterday, my dad asked me (he lives jn India), but there must be a lot of innovation in Canada, right? My answer was- Dad, the only innovation they have is immigration- a dubious scheme of luring young, desperate people into this country to take up loans (so that banks become richer, builders become wealthy and real estate agents can buy 200K worth cars from your money), pay exorbitant taxes and then get nothing in return except 5-6 months of freezing cold and a \u201cdream\u201d of good life that never materializes because you have to keep on hustling and grinding.\n\nStay where you are, if you are happy in India. This place is deteriorating compared to when I came here a decade ago. I am in a similar predicament myself recently.\nWell Canada didn\u2019t work for you, so why seek validation from others who may have had a different experience. Clearly you\u2019re happy in India so just continue to pursue what your heart desires\nWell that\u2019s cause india is a wonderful place if you have money. But if you\u2019re a middle class worker in India, you\u2019re not going to be able to afford the things you afford now, nor is your degree from an Indian college (unless it\u2019s iit or something) as prestigious (therefore higher salary) than the one you got from Canada. \n\nMost importantly, you have a stronger passport now. You have options. You can earn in $, spend in rupees and don\u2019t have to wait an eon and a day for visas (and you can afford to travel). \n\nAs for healthcare, again, that\u2019s cause you have money. The avg middle class family has 1-2 workers supporting children and elderly. The healthcare system you scoff at, although slow for non emergencies, provides high quality care. While in India, there are good govt hospitals that provide quality medical treatment, but you\u2019ll probably be on a mat in the corridors. Again, unless you have money. \n\nSo the QOL you and other nris enjoy isn\u2019t because India is a magical place that others don\u2019t recognize, it\u2019s because you just don\u2019t live in india. Even when you do live in india, you\u2019re living in a bougie bubble wrap india, not jostling in the local for 3hrs a day to and from work. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say india is bad or don\u2019t move back. Jsut maybe.. don\u2019t sound so judgmental ? Others want what you have, so that the can live the life you\u2019re living. There\u2019s no need for the \u201coh why do people chase foreign countries our lifestyle here is great\u201d. A bit hypocritical no ?\nCanada is not the place it used to be, poor migration strategies just made the country worse, it was never ready or equipped to handle such mass migration. It will take years to recover what has been done. You are blessed with a Canadian passport so now world is your limit. Try different countries, see what suites you the best and take that decision.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t blame Indians for dreaming migration. It\u2019s easier to say this with a first world passport in hand. Many others cant even go to their dream destination on holidays because of the passport. Just be grateful for what you have and let other dream for what they want.","10":"Thank you for your contribution to our subreddit.

Direction API, distance matrix , geo coding, street view, map sdk, notification services...  Not  to forget aws\/azure services... List can go on..\n\nI serviced a small  uber like cab vendor from Guwahati. There modest google api services alone gets avg of 3-5L monthly.\nYa i understand about everything which you can manage.\n\nQuick commerce is all about timing...how you gonna deal with traffic...i mean flyovers are generally traffic free but then have only few access points...how you gonna make things work out\nIt's been a while since I too thought about quick ecommerce especially in Guwahati,the problem is that when big players like zepto, blinkit or Instamart enters Guwahati, you will cease to exist. Moreover it's not tech only, it's ops heavy. And building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party API costs would be huge and also I think you are familiar with their warehouse models too, so there's another huge expense tbh, so good luck.\n\nComing to tech part, it's not a single guy work (if it's gonna be in a small period of time), u need a proper team (atleast one senior guy and some devs) and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate, so initial funding is therefore needed. Anyways good luck on your journey and feel free to dm, I'm mostly in tech part anyways.\nthere are white-label food delivery apps that you can buy and customise\/rebrand to validate your idea and Product Market Fit.\n\nBut if you want to create a zeto\/blinkit level tech, you need much much more than a tech partner (think multiple engineering teams and loads of $$$)","11":"all these projects =\/= the entirety of Thane.

We buy monthly groceries from dmart only. I buy everyday vegetables from station while coming. Rest remaining prices are so high on mrp that zepto and blinkit give same things at 20-30% off directly to home.\n\nLiving in well developed like Thane u get all this dmart, zepto buying groceries on Kolshet Road is easy dozens of road side vendors. All the new restaurants like foo, jimis burger 4 malls in a city. If in dombivli it's either 12km away Xperia or 5-6km away metro Infact in Mumbai also u won't get 2-3 malls within 2-3kms. 2 halls to watch drama, one Comdey club, decent clubs so many theaters. All this matter becoz at night 12pm u can come home if u live in thane. \n\nMany cities don't have anything, kdmc have 2 decent theater only one drama hall no Comdey club. At night if u wanna catch long journey train starting or getting off Thane would be by far easy Than getting down at Thane and then going Dombivli. \n\nAlso u can catch early flights 4-5am with 300-400rs by Cab from Thane but for Dombivli it shows 1200-1500 anytime no cabs even wants to drop at kdmc also. \n\nSo jokes in on you becoz vasant vihar and pokhran road are too expensive 22k per sq start but u can get home at affordable rest at Kolshet. Also near by metros options are 2 manpada, Kapurbawdi. Which are not bad. \n\nRest i agree the lodha Amara is the worst project among this list i have seen rooms and parking is such a mess. But rest Kolshet starting projects godrej Ascend puranik with dmart near buy are great u get flats with 14-15k per sq which is much better than paying 10-12k in dombivli-kalyan.\n\nP.S. : upgrade yourself if you can, 1 bhk 50-65 2bhk 1 - 1.2 cr if u get anywhere till Kolshet 6km radius from thane station. New\/old (check papers, old less than 10yrs) buy it.\n\nThane is much better package in terms of lifestyle  changes and facilities Than kdmc or i can't even think of a tier 2 city with no roads, no entertainment, no facilities and only north Indian food option restaurants. \n\nAnd u will be disappointed after 5 years when metro comes in thane.

Tell them, if there is any contraband, we'll have word with police. See how they react.if they still do. Ask the police to come. They'll warn and leave.\nAll delivery apps have a map pin function for delivery house location. Even if the apartment has no name (which is strange.

Because the costlier ones are bright, more aesthetic perfect shape. \n\nThe cheaper ones have holes, little soft(got stale a little) etc. \n\nWhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato? \n\nI have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better.\nTo compare you need their data.

Because VCs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden. Quick refunds, more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup.\n\nMany VCs now know that the market size for these services in India is small. So, VC funding is drying up. To remain alive these companies now need to become profitable. For that they need to try and extract that marginal cost. This can be through:\n\n1. Smaller fleets to reduce cost. This causes delivery times to go up.\n2. Bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size. This again causes delivery times to go up.\n3. Asking extra money if bunching isn't opted by customers.\n4. Saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons. This causes customer support quality to go down. Extra checks on claims, asking for pics, emails etc.\n5. Increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue.\n6. Hiking prices on subscriptions. Because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service. It is counter intuitive but true.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies. I use Swiggy and Bbinstant a lot. It has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak.\nThey are grouping order nowadays, in last 3-4 months I've had delivery person going in opposite direction, coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls, trying to search through my order in their bag, turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me.\u00a0\nAt least Blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem.

It's an easy\/logical \"NO\" from them. \n\nIn reality, it's a double edged sword. Airbnb and Uber both started with tiny TAMS and found ways to grow into massive businesses. Coca-Cola expanded their TAM once they started to view themselves as a FnB company, not just a soda company. \n\nBut it's hard to build a big business with a non-existent TAM. You should run some numbers...what is a reasonable SOM (obtainable market)? How big can that business be? \n\nThen you need a story on how you'll expand into a larger TAM.\nUnderstanding your TAM is important, as is your unit economics.\u00a0\n\nDo you want to build a startup, as opposed to just starting a business (where you don\u2019t need to raise capital and don\u2019t intend to hire more than a handful of people)?\n\nIf you want to build a startup your TAM needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage, but not too big that there\u2019s a tonne of competition.\n\nYour unit economics need to stack up against the TAM. In your example let\u2019s say there\u2019s a pool of 1M people, that would pay $30 twice a year to try a new tech toy. Your TAM is 60M.\n\nThis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 30-50% of the market.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at unit economics required to win millions of customers \u2026 eg. you\u2019d be getting $60 per customer per year, but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer?\u00a0You probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers. What\u2019s it cost to get your ad in front of a million people?\n\nAnd then how long do they stay a customer? Eg what is the LTV.\n\nWe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework you\u2019re in the low importance, low frequency box. This is the worst box to be in.\n\nSo it\u2019s a small TAM, high cost of customer acquisition, high churn \u2026\u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions.\n\nSo would I get hung up on TAM? No, but if the TAM is small you want the other factors to be good. If everything is bad, then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea.\nDepending on what stage of the startup you\u2019re on, tam\u2019s can work. However, the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if you\u2019re revenue model makes sense and you\u2019re able to show low acquisition costs, high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real TAM assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe SOM however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular - its really the calculation of what if any the Series A will look like\n\nat early stage $1 should get you something stupid like $1 in revenue, if they are asking for $1M seed to hit $1M in revenue, you have a Series A candidate, if their SOM is something bigger like $100M and all they need is $5 M preseed but the don't have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their SOM is $1M but need $2M to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nThe TAM for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\nCLTV and CAC are probably a much more telling exercise than the TAM SAM SOM\n\nBTW nearly 90% of our \"no's\" are based on our assessment of a weak founding team. 9% of our \"no's\" are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand (call back when you get some) 1% may include the TAM discussion posited in the post\nNeed to know TAM as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale. Easier to be a $100m company with a TAM of $100b than a TAM of $200M.\n\nBut in reality, TAM is very easy to manipulate and enlarge. If you are airBnB, you may have picked the private B&B market as your TAM. But the expand to private short-term rentals and TAM is much bigger. Then expand into hotels and it\u2019s huge. Now go global.\n\nTo me, a TAM is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything.\n\nI am working on an AI + human chat service\/platform. I am broadening the focus to service, support and sales. That expands potential market significantly. Then adding a human layer, likely means I can also cater to enterprise so from SMB to large enterprise. I am actually too broad and need to sort this out. But TAM is helpful.","43":"One problem with bigbasket is if you have multiple addresses in your account, please make sure that you choose the right address manually at the beginning of your session on the app. Also please make sure that the right address has been carried forward to the order summary page just before payment.

Being a low-income country, folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too in-disciplined to adopt productivity apps (let alone pay subscription fees for them!). Furthermore, if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is - people spend hours in local trains & buses. It is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments (Instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports, betting apps, etc. looking for instant gratification or 'quick' money). Neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps.\n\nTo summarize: Low-income population + Indiscipline + Poor public transportation\/infrastructure --> Instant gratification apps (such as betting, gaming apps).\n[deleted]","47":"","48":"","49":"Then don't call it a toy maintain the marketed nomenclature of a massager. \n\nI don't think anyone gives a damn even if they get to know that you're using a massager for toe curling fun.

In it's abscene, it's just burning VC money. \n\nUnlike your typical Kirana store, you have a mobile application to maintain (iOS + Android), marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees. Your usual Kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do.\nLike it depends if people in that city prefer convience, & also has high spending power. Than it'll work.\nTier 2-3 cities usually don\u2019t have that kind of spending power. They would go out and buy it. Tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra. \n\nBlinkit and Zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them. At any day I would save 5-10rs if I find a better price in either of the platforms. \n\nTier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit. Unless you don\u2019t have money to burn forget about it\nIt depends on the people...are they aware of such things?\nRecently, I came across the Namm Yatri app and loved their business model. Unlike Ola and Uber, which take a commission on every ride, NammaYatri uses a subscription-based SaaS approach. Drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app, and the rest of the money goes directly to them. It made me think: what if we applied this to grocery delivery? Instead of relying on dark warehouses like Zepto, we could use the existing network of local kirana stores. Consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store. The app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock, and delivery agents (who pay a small subscription fee) would pick up the items and deliver them. Payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth.\n\nBut of course, there are some challenges:\n\t\u2022\tStock availability\n\t\u2022\tStore hours limitations\n\t\u2022\tPrice inconsistency (can be solved with in-app payments)\n\t\u2022\tProduct quality\n\nIt\u2019s a simple idea, but I think it could really work if executed well.","73":"The concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up.\n\nIt's the After sales support I'm worried about.

I have always had terrible experience with Amazon Fresh and hence never used to order from Amazon Fresh. Lately, I have learnt that the so called \"rush delivery\" whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by Amazon Fresh.\n\nTwice I opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs. Today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and I contacted Amazon, I later learnt that all these so called \"rush deliveries\" are handled by Amazon Fresh. I then realized why they were getting delayed. Amazon Fresh has always been crap since Day 1. The worst part is they won't even let you cancel an Amazon Fresh order even if it has not been dispatched. \n\nSo if you are ordering something from Amazon, **never choose any of the time slots**, your order will be then handled by Amazon Fresh and you will be sorry you chose them.\n\nAs a side note, always check the item on Blinkit before ordering from Amazon. Their SKU has expanded significantly. The order which was delayed by Amazon Fresh, I checked it on Blinkit and got it in 5 minutes. Meanwhile the original Amazon order is now more than 36 hrs. old and there is no option to cancel it on Amazon.

I was looking forward to throwing away my useless towel from blinkit that keeps attaching little fibres on my body everytime I fucking use it. I ordered new, good towels, with great expectation, so that I don't have to deal with that sensory nightmare.\n\nI waited till 12pm. Checked. Still not out for delivery.\nI waited till 4pm. Checked. Nuh uh still no luck.\nI was getting impatient and tired of fucking waiting. Whatever maybe it's just coming tomorrow, I thought.\n\n7pm I resorted to taking a shower and using my towel, the worst towel in the entire universe. Got dressed, towel fibers attached to my fucking body, I'm lotioning myself and I can feel those fibres, I felt so irritated, I waited so long, why aren't my fucking towels here yet? Whatever, I'll be eating dinner outside with my friend and I'll be happy.\n\nIt's 7:30pm now, already ate 4 sushi and downed 1 bottle of soju, having a good conversation with my friend that I haven't seen in years. And that's your cue. \n\nThat's your fucking timing to deliver my fucking towels. While I'm out to a place with low cell service, that's when you had to show up to my building, when there's literally no way I can receive my goddamn towels. Aren't you amazing? Well I'm getting too heated up, you can just skip your delivery today and come tomorrow right? I mean that's what always happens anyway, it's not a big deal right? RIGHT?\n\nNO. YOU LITTLE SHIT. YOU LYING CHEATING PIECE OF SHIT. YOU GOT SO TRIGGERED AT ME NOT PICKING UP YOUR CALL. IT HURT YOUR EGO DIDN'T IT. THAT'S WHY YOU MARKED MY ORDER AS \"REJECTED BY CUSTOMER\". YOU LIED ABOUT ME NOT WANTING MY FUCKINH ORDER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY. BECAUSE YOU WERE OFFENDED THAT I DIDNT PICK UP YOUR CALL.\n\nWHY THE FUCK WOULD I REJECT IT?

I worked as developer in TD. \n\nI migrated to Canada and really struggled badly in Toronto. Lived there from 2018-2022. Since  2022 am living in India. I feel life here is much more relaxed I can afford much stuff here, delivery apps like Blinkit and Zepto are bliss. I can afford eating out in restaurants and bar. Toronto I couldn\u2019t afford most of the Resturant. Also am a typical middle class Indian guy so my eating habits are not westernized but again continental and other cuisines were very expensive. I don\u2019t eat pork\/beef or seafood so that was a challenge in finding variety. Restaurants were very expensive + forced tipping. \n\nI got treated with some prolong health issue in India as I couldn\u2019t  get appointment for 6 months in Toronto . Wondering why people consider Canada having high living standard ?  Is this false picture painted by 90s NRI family. At work I see everyone wants to move to Canada . \nI stayed in Scarborough and drivers were crazy crime rate was high. in my life first time I heard gun shots on Lawrence and Don mills. In Pune I never heard of  gun violence or shooting. \n \nAm thinking should I go back to Canada or just stay in India? When I see in India everyone is crazy to migrate to Canada . Maybe I couldn\u2019t adjust to Canadian culture but in first place I never knew what\u2019s Canadian culture ? I faced lot of racism as well in Toronto. As I worked with lot of immigrants who recently migrated 2-3 years so couldn\u2019t learn anything Canadian . I tried going to meetup to mingle felt I wasn\u2019t welcome. I don\u2019t have a single front Toronto. Everyone is so calculative. \n\nI only met one person in 8 years who told he was born in Toronto !  This post is all about my experience so don\u2019t think about saying negative about Canada. ","10":"QuickCommerce business in Guwahati, need tech partner. I am a businessperson in Guwahati and been doing business for the last 8yrs. \n\nSo i have been researching on starting a business of quick-commerce. Been to Bengaluru for it and got a first hand experience with BlinkIt and Zepto. I know it will be a tough place to compete but i have a few ideas which will give my business some advantages over them. I have this whole thing planned out and i believe this can be made into a huge business because there is a huge demand for it. I have planned the supple chain, recruitment, the cashflows, delivery and almost all aspects of this business. \n\nThe only thing i am stuck at is the tech part. I need an app. But i have limited knowledge about creating and mostly about maintaining the app. \n\nI dont want to make an app by a third party(which is very easy) - not because i need to pay them, but i want someone who is equally passionate about this and want someone who can concentrate and give enough time to this. \n\n\nSo i hv been looking for someone who is knowledgeable, passionate hardworking and serious about doing this business. \n\nIf you are serious and professional, i m ready to discuss about sharing ownership and do the necessary paperwork.

The apartment next to us doesn't have a name but the people from that apartment flat no. 101 use my apartment name n my flat number for all their online deliveries. All the orders they place come to us, disturb my elders by ringing bell and when we say it's not ours...the delivery person calls them and they say not ABC, come to 101 of adjacent building which is nameless. This has been happening since months, we told them multiple times not to use our address, but they aren't listening. \n\nCan we get into any trouble because of them using my address? Because my NRI family members have passport, bank accounts with this address. Those idiots usually order from blinkit zepto. But I'm scared, what if they order drug meds or any such stuff?

Thanks","13":" Found price differences across grocery delivery apps \u2013 building a solution!  So, I was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting. The price on BigBasket was \u20b989, on Blinkit it was \u20b9105, and Zepto had it for \u20b998. Naturally, I wondered \u2013 if the prices for one item differ this much, what about other groceries? I checked a few more items and, sure enough, almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts, promotions, or delivery fees.\n\nThat got me thinking: why isn\u2019t there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps?\n\nImagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get real-time price comparisons from Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, Swiggy Instamart, and others. You\u2019d see all the discounts, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times in one place, allowing you to make informed decisions and save money, just like you do when booking a hotel on Trivago.\n\nI\u2019m planning to build this app and would love feedback, suggestions, or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting. Let\u2019s make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent!  \n\nThe real motive behind this idea is to help people. With rising costs of living, every rupee saved counts. I want to empower people to shop smarter, save time, and make more informed choices. This app isn\u2019t just about convenience \u2013 it\u2019s about making sure everyone has access to the best deals, no matter what they\u2019re buying or where they live.\n\n","14":"Sanitary pads at NDLS \nI recently noticed a facility at New Delhi Railway Station that I felt was worth sharing. At the exit, there is a washroom where free sanitary pads are provided for women.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because it could be helpful for someone in need. A while ago, I faced a similar situation at Kashmere Gate Metro Station when my periods unexpectedly started. I tried ordering pads through Zepto and Blinkit, but the delivery was taking too long. Desperate, I walked almost 2-3 km to find a shop that sold them.\n\nHad I known about this facility at New Delhi Railway Station, it would have saved me so much time and energy. I hope this information reaches those who might need it and makes their day a little easier.","15":"Is it just me or have the delivery services significantly degraded in the past month? Average order times have gone up to 45-50 mins. I've had to cancel deliveries because no agent was found for upto 90 mins. Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto seem to have stopped services after midnight. Zomato's pricing is madness, unless you select the 19 rupee priority delivery your order will take an hour.

He said store doesn't have paper bags since two days. Delivery guy requested to raise the concern to Blinkit so that he can atleast get a delivery bag. \n\nAfter few hours, I spoke to their representative and informed them regarding the same and asked them to provide the delivery bag to the poor delivery guy coz the bag he was using is not hygenic. I have also requested them to arrange the return of the items if possible coz It had veggies, milk etc. and i don't feel like using it as it wasn't delivered in a hygenic bag. To my surprise, the customer service representative refused to arrange the return stating that they don't have any option of return in such cases.

( Found this community much more active and understanding, so posting my concern here ) I've done a Diploma in Computer Engineering but had to drop out from my B. Tech 2nd Year due to some personal reasons. I don't have any high-paying jobs since I have any skills that can get me a decent job. But with some basic skills, I'm making good enough to pay my bills. Currently, I'm trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else. And the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap.\n\n**How I fall into a debt trap:**\u00a0I tried to be a nice guy in Covid times and I helped my brother-like best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black Covid days. But I never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life. I helped him with all my savings and investments from Stokes. I was a fool, and for the sake of friendship, I helped him. He never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates. This stupidity made me fall into a 15X bigger debt trap than what I had helped him with. Other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap. My dog met with an accident, the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didn't give us deposit amount in return, Broker ran away with our money, I met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine, got scammed by someone worth of \u20b910,000 and still never got it back since the bank is SBI and we know how it works, recently my $160 worth of Crypto got stolen which I had received for completing tasks, and that was literally my last money in hand. :( Such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this.\n\n**What's my current status:**\u00a0I was in total debt of \u20b915 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me, I called my father and told him about my situation. I couldn't tell him everything because, in a conversation over a call, he thought that I was too stressed and might harm myself. I didn't wanted to give him more stress so I didn't tell him everything. But he still managed me around 5 lakhs and I paid my over dues. Now he thinks everything is clear but it's not. I cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as I was capable of. I worked as a Blinkit delivery partner, I worked for one YouTuber, and so on.\n\nNow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only \u20b990,000 is what I need on urgent basis. The rest amount is from some close people who're never gonna ask for it back but I'll return it asap I save something.\n\n**What's in that \u20b990,000:**\n\n**\u20b916,000:**\u00a0Ring Power Loan ( From Instant Loan App ) Overdue of 15+ Days and they're constantly calling every 5 min and knocking on my door every day. If I don't repay it tonight by 9, they'll reach my parent's house in my hometown and that would be a disaster for my life. My father will never talk to me again and my Girlfriend who has supported me in this bad time, I won't be able to marry without my parent's permission. I don't want to lose the love of my life and neither the respect of my parent's just for a small amount of money.\n\n**\u20b913,000 + \u20b919,000 + \u20b913,000:**\u00a0I had borrowed this from known people but as I promised them to pay last month, I couldn't pay them and now they're constantly calling me and want their money back. I can't keep them ignoring or they might talk to any of my brothers or father about this. Yes, I know I'm late and I'm really capable of paying them this amount instantly and they're not ready to wait for a few days.\n\nThe rest is small fractions of the amounts and that will take a very long paragraph to explain the story.\n\n**How I'll pay back:**\u00a0I've applied for the Rapido captain job. No matter what happens, I'll do my best to make \u20b91500 a day from Rapido. It might sound hard but I've to do it and I'll do it. Along with that I've a small work from one YouTuber that pays me \u20b99000 a month, and a small source of Income is Affiliate Income which can pay my daily bills. So whatever I'll earn from Rapido and other Gigs, I'll keep on paying it every week. Within 3-4 months I'll surely clear this with whoever kind-hearted person hear to help me.\n\nMen can understand the pain and shame of asking for money from your father or someone else when you're all capable of earning. Writing this post makes me feel so guilty but if I had any other option, I wouldn't be writing here, right? I'm all on my own, I'm trying my best but the pressure of paying for everything on time and the stress of other stuff is not letting me focus on my learnings. I don't blame anyone for this situation. I'm the only person who's responsible for this. I'm not really a fraud person. I'm seeking genuine help, please help me out and I won't forget you guys for my life.\n\nEven today when I call my parents, they never fails to ask me that \"Ab toh sab thik hai na?\", Mummy is like \"Kuch ho toh bata dena, aur bada mat kar dena wapis, tere papa befizul ka tension lete rehte hai.\" How I'm supposed to say her that nothing is okay, I'm stuck at the last stage. I've come really far and almost at the door step of a Stress-Free life. All I need is a saviour who can hold my hand and pull me up inside that stress-free world.\n\nIf you've come so far and read the whole post, I appreciate your patience. Thank you so much for giving your valuable time. You can reach me out for more info in my DMs. I would be happy to share everything you want to know. Even I'm ready to give you my ID details as well.","24":"Zepto\u2019s \u201c5-Minute\u201d Delivery: A Satirical Tale of Varna Minutes and Vanishing Riders \nYesterday, I had the honor of discovering Zepto\u2019s unique interpretation of time.

Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices?

Ever since Amazon stopped allowing partial payments with Amazon Pay and changed their return policy to be less lenient (which I suppose was a long time coming), I decided to diversify my e-commerce spending to other websites with my CB card since it offers the same benefits as the ICICI APAY card.\n\nAnyways, getting to my point: I spent over 60k on my SBI CB card this month due to high expenses in my household. I went through my spend analyzer, and most of my transactions are as follows:\n\n1. Food Delivery: Approx. 16k+ (using Park+ to get vouchers for Zomato or buying directly from Swiggy or MagicPin)\n\n2. Groceries: 6k (from Zepto, Blinkit, BB etc.)\n\n3. Traveling: 10k (RedBus, IRCTC and GOIBIO)\n\n4. E-commerce: 15k (mostly on Cred, Amazon, FKor various websites, often paying through gateways like Razorpay, Mobikwik, and Amazon Pay)\n\n5. The rest are just offline spends , petrol and maybe utility \n\nI only received Rs. 1,200 as cashback when it should be over 2000. Something is wrong, and I cannot see how much cashback each transaction has earned, like I can on ICICI or HDFC card statements.\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed with this.

Recently, the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company Zomato announced an initiative, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, to limit food wastage because of canceled orders.\n\nRight after Zomato\u2019s cofounder Deepinder Goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media, a Bengaluru-based product manager, suggested potential improvements on Twitter for the feature to prevent misuse.\n\nThe man named Bhanu proposed that Zomato\u2019s Food Rescue option should exclude cash-on-delivery orders, and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500-metre radius of their location.\n\nHe opined that customers can misuse the discounts, where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices. Further, the Bengaluru man recommended that Zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer, capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature.\n\nThoroughly impressed, the Zomato boss responded directly to Bhanu\u2019s post, saying that these suggestions, among others, had already been incorporated into the feature. Goyal praised Bhanu\u2019s \u201cgood thinking,\u201d and inquired about Bhanu\u2019s background expressing the desire to work together in the future.\n\n\u201cWho are you and what do you do?\u201d the Zomato cofounder wrote. \u201cWould love to know you more, and see if we can work together.\u201d\n\nBhanu replied that he is a product manager based in Bengaluru, working for a startup. He also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media, particularly tagging Zomato\u2019s sister company, Blinkit. \n\nIncidentally, with Zomato\u2019s new feature, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order. To maintain the quality and freshness of the food, the option will remain open only for a short time. ","29":"Looking for decent 2nd credit card? To give some context:\n\nI graduated from college last year, and have been working for 1.5 years in Bangalore.\n\nI got an SBI SimplySave card once I started full-time, since I didn't have a credit score (760+ rn) , and it has been pretty useful so far. Since it's a RuPay card, I use it for UPI and I don't have any issues fulfilling the reversal spend. SBI card offers on Amazon seem to be good as well.\n\nOther than the regular UPI merchant spends, my major spends are on Zomato, Blinkit,Eatsure (around 5-7k per month) and once in a while Amazon. I usually pay the bill using the 15% off on Rupay CC on Zomato dining, whenever I go out with friends, so that's also helpful. I dont have any airline or hotel expenses over the year.\n\nSo I have the following questions:\n\n- Are there any good cards which would suit my usecase without any major yearly fees? ( Can stretch if needed )\n\n- Is SimplySave a good card for me? Or should I close it and get something else? (Have seen people say it's a terrible card in this sub, however it's decent for my usecase)\n\n- Any good ways to optimise on the food delivery spends?\n\n\n\n","30":"Delivery apps analysis What are your thoughts on quality and cost: Amazon Fresh vs Blinkit vs Swiggy Instamart vs BigBasket vs Zepto?\n\nI was ordering groceries today and had some free time, so I did a quick comparison of these services.

Flipkart has re-entered the QC space with its new \u2018Minutes\u2019 offering.3. Zepto raised nearly $1 billion in funding this year.  \n  \nQC companies are expanding into new categories, including restaurant food, fashion, and electronics.  \n  \nThe QC business model is straightforward: Revenue = GMV x Margin + Fees  \nGMV is growing as average order values increase with new categories and customer frequency rises as people become more comfortable with QC.Margins are improving with the introduction of private labels and newer brands that are willing to pay a premium.Fees are increasing through platform charges, advertising, and listing fees from brands.On the cost side, expenses like wastage, delivery, and warehousing are becoming more efficient and should decrease over time.","33":"Blinkit bigbasket zepto scam(chor) I wanna address something here i was noticing from very long time.

So i tried to return it but i missed the delivery guy call in which they made my order not returnable. Then i again order something and i told the delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused. when i said let me talk to your manager. he also refused to give me number, since there was language barrier between us, my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening. In the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it. So after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders. My friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them. So after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there. It was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language. They even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me. After we talked to manager. The manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry. The another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it. I said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue. then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian. So they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them.\n\nThen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry. Then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen. They asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless. They asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money. Somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused. Then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it. I am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","41":"Hey Everyone, I want to work on this Idea, If any interested folks to invest or want to share the feedback I am open.

When the agency\/shop\/etc., receive any order they will put the order in the drone baggage compartment.\n2. The drone is automatically receives customer destination and how to reach there.\n3. The path drone follows is the main USP for this total project.\n4. The backend algorithm collabs with the ride apps such as Uber\/ola, etc.,\n   1. The algorithm works as follows\n   2. The algorithms, gets track of all the live rides going on with the ride apps(ref. Point4)\n   3. Then calculates the nearest point where drone can get on the vehicles participating in the live rides.\n   4. The drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicle(auto\/cab\/etc.,) to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top.\n   5. During the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone.\n      1. Scenario 1: If vehicle stuck in traffic, then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer.\n      2. Scenario 2: When vehicle is taking different route than the destination, then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle.\n\n\u00a0\n\n* This method is useful in cases of emergencies, medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time.\n* The business like zepto\/blinkit can reduce their dark stores.\n* The delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part.\n* The complications happens from the drones can be reduced.\n\nI hope I can get lot of insights from talented people out there.","42":"Is assessing TAM overrated ?  Of course, TAM is the most crucial aspect to assess before you invest your money and time in a venture in the unknown, but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche, yet in the grand scheme of things, it can be a brilliant product\/service. Users probably don't know they needed it, but they do if it's executed correctly.\n\nI have been building a peer-to-peer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market, for pennies. For example, renting the Apple Vision Pro (a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since it's not a very refined product) for a day for just 30-40 USD.(Sorry for the dumbed down explanation) \n\nAnd I have been told that it's a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities, especially in the Indian market, because Indian users are very different from those in the USA or European countries. First, it's a trust deficit market; people here believe in ownership. Although the population might look very huge, if you look at the TAM based on monetary value, it's a very small chunk, less than 0.5% of the population, but still a huge number and growing every day.\n\nAnd finally, my assessment is, if there is no way to avail this service, how would users know that it can be done? Quick commerce (10-minute grocery delivery) seemed to be a very absurd idea in the Indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store (grocery store) owners, and in every street, you can find multiple stores. Yet, it's a billion-dollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift. People are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas (operations limited to a few cities with high target population), and availing credit has become easier than anything. So one thing leads to another, and it's shaping an industry that still looks very absurd  . However, one of the many companies in the market, Blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion USD and threatening the business of giants like Amazon and Flipkart. \n\nI'm a first-time founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when I needed a camera for a project and couldn't find the one I wanted. So, I came up with this idea, but it took five years to finally execute it. We now have a few users on version 1.0 of our MVP. The biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trust-deficit market, and sometimes it feels like I'm working on a vetting company more than a P2P rental marketplace. We have learned so much in building it so far that I believe if this doesn't work, the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity.\n\nPlease share your thoughts or concerns. \n\nThank you for reading ","43":"Opinion on the service offered by bigbasket\/blinkit\/instamart etc.?

From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","54":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.  ","55":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Feb 26th, 2024 Hi r\/ecommerce \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry pretty closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Each week I post a summary recap of the week's top stories, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in...  \n.\n\n1. **Walmart** surpassed $100B in online sales last year for the first time. Walmart is still not making money from e-commerce, but it's getting close. They've lowered e-commerce losses by more than 40% compared to last year\u2019s level and plans for online sales to become profitable with the help of its ancillary businesses like its advertising and fulfillment services to brands that sell on its marketplace. In the U.S., approximately 30% of Walmart\u2019s Marketplace sellers currently use Walmart Fulfillment Services.  \n.\n2. **Shein** launched its spring and summer collection yesterday via a livestream, working with celebrity influencers to attract attention to its shoppable livestream show \u201cShein Live: Front Row.\u201d This is the second time they've leveraged livestream to launch new collections. Last September, Shein showcased apparel from its fall-winter collection during a shoppable livestream event as well. Shoppers were able to view the three-hour livestream on YouTube, X, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as on Shein's app. Noticeably TikTok was not included on that list of channels, which could be because their livestream software doesn't yet integrate with TikTok, as I've recently learned that TikTok doesn't make it easy for 3rd party streaming platforms to connect.  \n.\n3. **Google** and **Reddit** negotiated a $60M content licensing deal to allow Reddit's data to be used to train their AI models, and they announced it in the weirdest way possible. Google wrote, \u201cReddit plays a unique role on the open internet as a large platform with an incredible breadth of authentic, human conversations and experiences, and we\u2019re excited to partner to make it even easier for people to benefit from that useful information.\u201d LOL \u2014 *human conversations*? Did Gemini write that announcement? As part of the deal, Reddit will integrate Google's Vertex AI to enhance its search capabilities on the platform, and Google now has access to Reddit's Data API, which delivers real-time content from their platform.  \n.\n4. **Amazon** is working on a new e-commerce marketplace to reach Indian shoppers called Bazaar, which it hopes will help the company further compete against Walmart-owned Flipkart, Reliance-owned Ajio, and SoftBank-backed Meesho. Bazaar will only feature unbranded fashion and lifestyle products that are priced below 600 Indian rupees ($7.20 USD), and Amazon will take no referral fee on sales. They will instead solely earn through their advertising and fulfillment services.  \n.\n5. **Wix** is tapping into Shopify's ecosystem for cross-border sales Okay, well technically Wix is partnering up with **Global-e** to help merchants sell internationally. However, Shopify acquired a 6.5% stake in Global-e back in 2021, which it increased to 10.20% in 2022, and most recently to 12.8% \u2014 so that makes it part of Shopify's ecosystem, right? Same as if Wix tapped into Flexport's fulfillment network or Klaviyo's e-mail and SMS services? The partnership will enable Wix merchants to price and sell in more than 100 countries, create customized local welcome messages and checkout flows, adhere to local tax and duty requirements, offer flexible pricing by country, and more.  \n.\n6. After retaking day-to-day control of **Square** last fall, Jack Dorsey is planning to overhaul the 15-year-old app so that it works more cleanly with Block's other products. His goal is to make Cash App one of the top providers of banking services to US households earning up to $150k annually by beefing up financial tools and making the P2P app the go-to banking source for Square sellers. A top priority this year will be tightening the integrations across Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, while eliminating up to five versions of the Square app that previously targeted different user groups and instead creating a single app called Square, with tabs for users to access various services.  \n.\n7. **Spotify** is following in the footsteps of Meta, Snap, YouTube, and TikTok by launching a new program to connect creators with brands. AUX, its new in-house \u201cmusic advisory agency\u201d for brands, will facilitate connections between brands and emerging artists for campaigns benefiting both parties. Coca-Cola is AUX's first client, which will team up with Peggy Gou, a South Korean DJ and songwriter, for a long-term partnership that will include live concerts, events, social media content, a branded playlist, and on-platform promotional support.  \n.\n8. **ShipBob** is now offering Amazon Shipping as a new delivery option for eligible US orders, according to its Winter '24 Release. It will now appear as a shipping option next to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, and ShipBob's other fulfillment partners. Amazon Shipping is the company's shipping service for external deliveries that competes directly with FedEx and UPS. The service launched in 2018, but was paused in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic because Amazon was flooded with its own orders that it could barely keep up with during lockdown. However in August 2023, Amazon relaunched Amazon Shipping in the U.S. for both packages sold on Amazon's website and items from other marketplaces and selling channels.  \n.\n9. **62 million tons of paper and cardboard waste** in the US ends up in landfills, which accounts for around 56% of the 110 million tons manufactured each year, according to a study from the US Department of Energy. The estimated market value of paper and cardboard lost to landfilling in 2019 was $4B.   \n.\n10. **Walmart's PhonePe** launched an India mobile app store called \u201cIndus Appstore\u201d to challenge the dominance of Google's Play Store in the country. Indus Appstore features over 200k apps including Flipkart, Spotify, and Paytm, supports third-party payments and will not levy any listing fees for one year.   \n.\n11. Google stopped allowing users to generate images of humans with its **Gemini AI** tool last week after people complained that it produced pictures of Black founding fathers, a female pope, and gay couples when you asked it to create images of straight couples. Google aims to avoid bias in the output of its AI tools, but attempting to remove stereotypes has caused them to \u201cmiss the mark,\u201d according to Google.   \n.\n12. In other AI news at Google, the company introduced **Gemma**, a family of lightweight open AI models built from the same research and technology used to create Gemini, to compete with Meta's Llama 2 and other open source large language models. While Gemini is a closed AI model that directly competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the lightweight Gemma will be suitable for smaller tasks like simple chatbots or summarizations.   \n.\n13. **Cart.com** began offering its order management software solution as a standalone product. The Constellation Order Management System allows merchants to unify orders and inventory across multiple channels and was previously only available as part of Cart.com's unified commerce and logistics solution, but is now available to merchants on all e-commerce platforms.   \n.\n14. **DoorDash** agreed to pay $375k to settle claims that it broke California's privacy laws by giving away customers' info without their consent and without giving them the opportunity to opt-out. The company also agreed to review its technology and contracts with marketing and analytics vendors to confirm it's sharing or selling information legally.   \n.\n15. **BigCommerce** launched a new video series called B2B Bites, which will offer a curated collection of videos featuring wisdom from B2B industry leaders. The new series will feature expert interviews, how-to guides, trend analysis, and success stories with topics ranging from how to prepare your business for an exit to how to optimize your site for SEO.   \n.\n16. **Zilch**, the UK-based BNPL firm, launched a new credit payment product called \u201cPay Over 3 Months,\u201d which is designed for larger purchases such as buying electronics, car tires, or home repairs. The new offering has already been tested by over 100k customers, and the company plans to roll it out to 3.6M users in April.   \n.\n17. **AfterShip** enabled Apple Wallet Order Tracking, which allows users to receive delivery updates in real time through their Apple Wallets. Customers can activate the new feature by clicking the Track with Apple Wallet button on a merchant's order confirmation page or within e-mail and SMS order confirmations.   \n.\n18. **Walmart** and **Amazon** are facing legal trouble over the points-based attendance systems (which are kinda like Shrute Bucks) they use to track worker absences, which resulted in the firing of multiple employees. In the lawsuit, fired workers accuse the companies of violating their employment rights by terminating them after they took legally protected time for sick, medical, or pregnancy-related leave.   \n.\n19. **Zomato**, the Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, is planning to expand its 10-minute delivery platform, Blinkit, by adding products from various categories, which would put the company in direct competition with Amazon and Flipkart. The company plans to build its supply chain to directly source products and manage stock and is already in talks with individual brand owners to stock up on inventory.   \n.\n20. **Meta** expanded its Instagram Creator Marketplace tool to eight new markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Japan, India, Brazil, and Chinese export brands. The Creator Marketplace initially launched in 2022 as a means to help connect US-based brands with Instagram influencers for in-app partnership opportunities, and now advertisers will gain access to a wider variety of creators who can help expand their target audiences.   \n.\n21. **Google** confirmed a bug with using negative search operators within Google Shopping, which is a way to exclude words from your search results. Google is aware of the issue and working on a fix, but as of now, it's not resolved.   \n.\n22. **Credit card debt in the US** is now at record levels, reaching over $1.13 trillion, and interest rates on those cards have soared. This number does not include the growing debt of BNPL platforms, since these loans are often not reported to credit agencies.   \n.\n23. **Indonesia** issued regulation requiring digital platforms like Meta and Google to pay media outlets that provide them with content, which the country says is part of its efforts to ensure media companies \u201care not eroded\u201d by digital platforms. A committee will be formed to ensure digital platforms fulfill their responsibilities to the media companies. Google said it will review the regulation, and Facebook did not respond to comment.   \n.\n24. **Amazon** is now offering new gifts bags with handles in the US and EU, which are made from 100% recycled material and can be reused for future uses. The new bags still have the dual drawstrings, and you can stuff the handles down inside the bag, since they are attached from the inside, if you prefer the classic gift bag look.   \n.\n25. **Klarna** is launching a digital verification service called \u201cSign in with Klarna\u201d that is designed to speed up consumer login to e-commerce sites and apps in 23 countries including the US. On registration, the customer chooses what data they'd like to share with the store and if they want to join their membership or loyalty programs.   \n.\n26. **Chinese livestreaming agencies** promised rising influencers fame and money, but ended up trapping them in multi-year contracts without giving the influencers the support they promised. Legal disputes are now on the rise as livestreamers attempt to leave their contracts, resulting in the agencies demanding money.   \n.\n27. **The US Department of Commerce** announced the designation of 31 Tech Hubs in regions across the country, as part of the first phase of its new economic development initiative designed to drive regional innovation and job creation. The program invests directly in burgeoning, high-potential US regions and aims to transform them into globally competitive innovation centers.   \n.\n28. **TikTok** is launching a \u201cStar Creator\u201d team to focus on finding and developing influencers who can drive sales to TikTok Shop. According to its job portal, the company is hiring for several new roles in the US and UK including a \u201cstar creator manager\u201d and a team lead focused on Shop creators who are good at selling fashion items.   \n.\n29. **UPS** is cutting sorting shifts in New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, as the delivery company continues to adjust to volume declines. The company did not say exactly how many employees would be let go, but stressed that the layoffs help them deliver \u201cindustry-leading service\u201d and maintain \u201ccompetitive prices.\u201d   \n.\n30. **Overstock.com** is planning to relaunch its store on Shopify in about five weeks, which it shut down last year after acquiring Bed Bath & Beyond's intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction for $20M in favor of operating on its business on BedBathandBeyond.com instead. Marcus Lemonis, executive chairman of the board, said that in hindsight, shutting down their website was a \u201cfatal mistake.\u201d  \n.\n31. Plus 8 e-commerce **seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions** of interest including Carewell, an e-commerce platform for caregiving products, raising $24.7M in a Series B round led by MBF Healthcare.  \n.\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Marcus Lemonis, executive chairman of the board, said that in hindsight, shutting down their website was a \u201cfatal mistake.\u201d  \n.\n31.

I couldn't find a flair that matched.\n\nI ordered some groceries on Blinkit, and the order, which was  supposed to be delivered in 17 minutes, was late by 10 or so minutes. The guy called me and told me he was outside my apartment, near a white car. I asked him to wait there, and went down. There was nobody there. I waited for 2 minutes and then went back home, because I had something on the stove. I called him back, and asked him where he was. He told me the name of a different apartment. I told him that wasn't the location, and gave him directions. While I'm on the phone, I can hear him getting directions from someone on the road. In between all of this, he kept apologizing, and starting every sentence with 'thappa nenachukkaadheenga...'\n\nA couple of minutes later, I open the door randomly to see if he's there yet, and see a college-aged guy standing right outside, hesitating. He apologizes again, tells me he's new, and starts taking out my things from his bag. That's when I notice his brand new Blinkit bag and realise how new he is. I ask him if today's his first day, and he smiles and says yes. As soon as he handed over everything, he asks me whether I've paid online, again with the customary 'thappa nenachukkaadheenga...'. I tell him I have, and show him my phone. He thanks me, and tells me this was his first delivery ever. I wish him all the best, and as he turns to leave, I see him smiling to himself. Not the normal smile. You know how sometimes when you're pleased with yourself, or thinking of something really nice, and there's nobody to see you, you smile this really happy smile to yourself, right? That smile. \n\nThis was a young man joining the workforce, and feeling excited and nervous about it. Everyone has to start somewhere, and he was proud of himself after delivering his first order. Praveen, if you're reading this - All the best again!\n\nI know the story is pointless, but just wanted to share it because it felt weirdly wholesome and heart warming.","61":"Got scammed by Blinkit Today I ordered 1 gm gold coin with blinkit, along with the 1gm silver coin. It was all prepaid. I wasn\u2019t there at home to receive the order, so I gave the otp to my younger brother to get it received. After 20 mins I reached home and saw wrong item was delivered l. I got 0.5gm Malabar gold coin ( rose design ). What I ordered was 1 gm Mata lakshmi gold coin. Aur 20 mins baad return window has been closed, I can\u2019t contact any support executive. Maine delivery waale ko call lagaya, I literally cried while talking to him. Uske paas delivery karne se pehle woh coin ke pictures hai par usne kaha woh kuch nhi kar skta even after knowing he delivered me wrong item. Subah subah 4700 ka scam hogya. Someone here please help.","62":"Humbled by this delivery guy So i was walking back home after dinner and saw this delivery guy with 3-4 bags of zepto blinkit etc, staring into the opening of this cafe\n\nIt was very cold ~10 degrees and he was standing still with eerie silence. There were quite a few people inside this cafe of the same age as that of the delivery guy and they were partying, playing snooker and drinking coffee right in front of that window opening\n\nHe must have completed his last deliveries nearby, as his electric scooter was parked nearby. I passed just next to him and he didn't even flinch or even notice.\n\nThere was music and noise coming from inside of the cafe but there was absolute silence outside where he was standing.\n\nReminds me to stay humble and appreciate little things in life. Hope i stay grateful for the things this universe has provided me.\n\nI hope he gets to visit this cafe someday with his friends (if he has any) and enjoy a good day there. \n\nPs: i couldn't do anything to help him, im a student and hes better off earning by working hard as delivery person, so there's nothing i could have really done","63":"Blinkit, which was acquired by Zomato in a 2022 deal valued at $568 million, is now evaluated at a staggering $13 billion by Goldman Sachs, surpassing Deepinder Goyal-led Zomato's core food delivery business ","64":"Blinkit Launches Bistro, a Quick Food Delivery App Bistro.

Kiranas struggle to keep up with quick commerce Not surprisingly, [mini warehouses are sprouting up in residential neighbourhoods, replacing kiranas](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/OKkhQVeK1R4?si=A8q31IQqb7LAawmR)\n\nSon of a former shopkeeper in our area is now a BlinkIt delivery guy ","67":"Instead of worrying whether Swiggy or Zomata or other quick commerce companies will perform, I just sit back and invest in companies that provide packaging papers to these companies(Proxy Companies) Seriously, why ruin my mental health by having misgivings about the rise\/downfall of certain quick commerce companies(whether swiggy,blinkit or zepto will ultimately become the market leader) when I can just invest in a proxy company?\n\nSeeing the rise in quick commerce in India, I decided to invest in a paper company(which I will not name). This is a multi-bagger in the making(from my POV)  \n  \nYou know how you get your *products\/food* by an amazon\/swiggy delivery boy in a package right? They supply this packaging paper and is a fundamentally strong company(the stock is also undervalued). While these quick commerce companies fight tooth and nail for market share in this competitive industry, pudumjee provides the supply of paper to carry out their deliveries which has resulted in an explosion in their their earnings\n\nThis post is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Its just to share the benefits of investing in proxy companies","68":"Qcomm vs Madiwala Market price comparison. The price we pay for convenience is not so small. TL;DR: Quick commerce is charging too much, sometimes double the price for essential vegetables when compared to local market.\n\nLike most of us I used to order everything on Blinkit. I was so used to the convenience Q comm offered, I never bothered going to Madiwala market which is hardly 500 meters from where I stay.\u00a0\n\nOwing to scale of operations and purchasing power I always assumed these players will be able to give at a price comparable with the local market. Maybe charge a small premium for the convenience.\u00a0\n\nBut today a casual stroll through Madiwala market was a huge surprise to me\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe I was paying more than 100% of the market price for onions, green chillies and lemon. Almost all the vegetables which I buy regularly were being sold at upwards of 40% premium.  On top of this they charge delivery fees and all the absurd convenience fees \n\nThis is ridiculous. With inflation at a 15 month high, frequent visits to your local market can go a long way in protecting and growing your savings.\u00a0\n\nMy analysis in comments as imgur link.","69":"Starting my new venture that helps D2C brands deliver products in 30-60 mins like Blinkit and Zepto in India Hi Guys,\n\nI am launching a new venture to help D2C brands offer 30-60 minute deliveries directly from brand website and app \u2014 bringing the speed and convenience customers crave!\n\nWhy it's a win for your brand:\n\n1.

I am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app. We already have zomato, swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery. Does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city ? ","73":"Swiggy Instamart is really helpful Sorry for off topic. But I wanted to share this. I usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit, zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy. This incident made me reconsider my thoughts.\n\nI typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab. Since it's raining in Bengaluru, I need an umbrella for tomorrow's office travel. But all shops were closed as I searched nearby. Suddenly I got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart. \n\nAnd surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 Rs. Since I have the Swiggy HDFC CC, I used that too and got additional 28RS cashback. \n\nThen I realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else I would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella.\n\n","74":"Is it weird how safe I felt in blinkit bhaiyas arms? \n\nSo basically I wanted to go to zudio for buying some clothes and was feeling lazy to walk till main gate from h hostel .  thankfully one delivery bhaiya from blinkit agreed to take me till Gate.

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","78":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0[r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/\/)\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software.

","80":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, \u201cWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use \u2013 things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.\u201d\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0offering\u00a0an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 \u2014 excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items. (What's considered a \u2018luxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, \u201cHold my beer\u2026\u201d\n___\n**WhatsApp**\u00a0is\u00a0getting a new chat memory feature\u00a0that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service. Sellers do not need to sign up to be eligible to receive the label, which does not have a cost. Alongside the change, eBay Germany is dropping its \u201ceBay Guarantee\u201d and \u201ceBay Plus\u201d logos.\n___\n**Bestbuy Baby**, which has nothing to do with Best Buy the electronics retailer and is actually a baby retailer that had been part of the Bed Bath & Beyond group, is\u00a0closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores\u00a0to relaunch as a strictly online platform. The retailer previously closed and liquidated 115 locations last year when its parent company went bankrupt, but then months later announced a new strategy and the opening of 11 new stores, which will soon be shuttered.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing the sale\u00a0of refurbished electronics from select sellers on its platform, all which are required to meet specific performance standards. For example, sellers must provide reports from an approved 3rd party like PhoneCheck, Blancco, or BlackBelt, who inspect and rate the quality of the refurbished products. Currently only \u201cpremium\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d items can be sold.\n___\nPlus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Klarna** selling most of its portfolio of short-term, interest-free loans to Elliott Advisors, a London-based hedge fund, for \u00a330B.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","82":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/ - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did.

Apologies if this is a stupid question, I cannot seem to frame the question such that Google would answer it for me. \n\nI was looking at setting up my own \"dark store\" (a place where q-commerce companies like Blinkit store goods to be able to deliver quickly). I believe I have found a building in an otherwise densely populated area that has a terrace that satisfies the basic requirements of a dark store (including quick access by delivery men). \n\nThe building secretary seems keen, but I have been wondering if there could be legal issues. For example, I know you cannot make a home in a commercial building, and sometimes you cannot run a business from your home in a residential building. \n\nAny guidance on the laws\/statutes would be helpful. \n\nI live in Mumbai btw, if you required that info.","84":"Blinkit\/Zepto\/BigBasket using NRI number? Anyone had any luck with any of the quick delivery apps using their individual NRI numbers? ","85":"Starting to see the end of affordable grocery delivery apps? Came on here after hearing and seeing Zepto's plan to become profitable. I'm starting to see rs. 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members. This could be across India, but I'm seeing it already here in Bengaluru where lots of people order groceries. Even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs. 599 which isn't something I'll be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase. Seems to me that if this starts making them enough money, other apps will follow. Zepto is currently the only one without big backing - blinkit has zomato, bigbasket has tata, instamart has swiggy, and milkbasket has reliance, and they're facing difficulty in getting funding, but seems to me like I'd rather go to a grocery store now, where I can get better discounts, which I've been doing since they've started rolling this out. \n\nIs it just me? Or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes? Is the market too saturated with choices? \n\nWhat do you all think? How popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here? \n\nEdit: I was born and brought up in Bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown. For urgent needs I've always gone to the local store next to my apartment, or other stores nearby. However, when I'm coming back home late at night after work around 9-10, I've been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like Zepto. I'm saying it's a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible. That's what I meant. ","86":"Swiggy has released its FY24 results (Unlisted Share)\n **Revenue and Profitability:**\u00a0Swiggy has demonstrated strong financials ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The Bengaluru-based firm reported a 33% jump in its revenue to Rs 11,634 crore in FY24 from Rs 8,714 crore in FY23. Swiggy has also managed to reduce its losses by 44% to Rs 2,350 crore in the last fiscal year.\u00a0\n\n**Business Growth:**\u00a0Swiggy said that its food delivery business grew 17% to Rs 6,100 crore while its quick commerce vertical Instamart registered Rs 1,100 crore gross revenue in the last fiscal year. When compared, Zomato's overall revenue in FY24 jumped 71% to Rs 12,114 crore. This includes Rs 6,161 crore from the food business and Rs 2,301 crore via the grocery business, Blinkit. Swiggy was neck and neck with Zomato in terms of food delivery whereas it was behind in terms of grocery business.\n\n**Business Prospects:**\u00a0Swiggy's consumer-facing business comprising food delivery, Instamart, and dining recorded a total gross order value (GOV) of Rs 35,000 crore driven by its 14.3 million monthly transacting users. Continuous improvements in contribution margin across segments is driven by rising take rates and higher contribution of advertisement revenues, cost optimization, and reduction of discounts. Instamart's rapid expansion was on the back of the increased density of dark stores in existing cities and expansion to new cities.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bki5873mybrd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8032a3245de0ddb97e92383805810ea08ea706\n\n","87":"Quick Commerce haul \u2728\ufe0f  Got my first set of Hot Wheels from Blinkit (a quick delivery app here in India) at INR 179 per piece, which is 2.14 USD per piece. \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8 ","90":"Zomato stock drops 5% as Macquarie sees nearly 50% downside due to fierce competition.  https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0mjnqstwwp3d1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=35ac53a30a3e09955cdedb20a7320fbcf60f2bfd\n\nMacquarie cautioned that rising competitive intensity in the quick commerce segment, especially with the entry of Jio Mart's 30-min grocery delivery, may hurt Blinkit, Zomato's quick commerce arm.","91":"Experiences of Indians Returning from Abroad: Life-Changing Perks and Services ndians who have lived abroad and returned to India: What are some perks, products, or services that you find drastically life-changing or that you would consider returning to the previous country for?\n\nAdditionally, what are the mind-blowing apps or services from other countries that disrupt industries, similar to how BlinkIT has transformed quick commerce grocery delivery in India?

Yesterday one of the delivery partner was robbed by the customer who ordered the product. He came in a car, he was with two women, all three seems to be drunk. He took the product, beat up the delivery guy, abused him and took his phone as well and ran off. The delivery partner had two phones, both the phones were robbed by the customer. \n\nThe delivery guy would be in his 30s and has a small family. \nThis delivery guy came running in the morning to tell the ordeal to the Manager, the case Sint being looked into without any seriousness. He was told to come after half an hour by the manager and told actions will be taken.

Aap please apna location change krdo. \n\nI: show me. (He did show his phone for a microsecond and was trying his best to hide it.I said show me again).

What could they do it I changed my location.","99":"Blinkit delivery fee scam I needed some urgent printouts today, so tried blinkit print. I required 10 pages and blinkit was showing 30 rupee for it. \n\nAfter filling up cart order of 200+ to save on delivery fee, I made the payment, but the payment failed.\n\nNow I repaid immediately and cart value was same, however on delivery, they didn't give the printouts. On checking the invoice, instead of printout, they have added 30 rupee as delivery fee.\n\nNow when I called them, they said since payment failed once, the printouts were automatically removed, however no notification was given to me and the invoice remained same. Even the final payment page didn't show anything new.\n\nNow they are refusing any compensation and saying it's the bank's fault. I had urgent need of those printouts, but instead of getting that, I got filler items with a delivery charge.","101":"After Swiggy, Blinkit now wants to delivery food in 10 mins Blinkit has announced it would launch a service called Bistro to deliver food in 10 mins.

instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free delivery\nhere to stay but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other channels highly possible that we will see more logistics companies coming up soon to deliver locally for restaurants mncs directly instead of working with q commerce","1":"is it normal for blinkit delivery people to ask for a photo i ordered for the first time from blinkit and when i went to take the other the delivery person asked to take a photo of me with the bag i opposed to it but he said its required as they have to upload it on the app or something at last they clicked a picture of package i thought i wasnt in the photo but now i think that the camera angle definitely got me i just want to know am i going to be kidnapped now while going out or is it a normal thing  yes some people do as there could be expensive items or for some orders they are asked to click a picture\n\nit happened to me twice but they clicked a picture of my hand basically holding that stuff not full picture\nthey are allowed to take the picture of the goods they deliver but you dont need to be included in the photo\nit is not normal inform this to the blinkit support just in case

deliverytime slot delivery from amazon  it gets delivered by amazon fresh which is crap so earlier amazon used to clearly demarcate if your order will be delivered by amazon fresh or amazon i have always had terrible experience with amazon fresh and hence never used to order from amazon fresh lately i have learnt that the so called rush delivery whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by amazon fresh\n\ntwice i opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so called rush deliveries are handled by amazon fresh i then realized why they were getting delayed amazon fresh has always been crap since day 1 the worst part is they wont even let you cancel an amazon fresh order even if it has not been dispatched \n\nso if you are ordering something from amazon never choose any of the time slots your order will be then handled by amazon fresh and you will be sorry you chose them\n\nas a side note always check the item on blinkit before ordering from amazon their sku has expanded significantly the order which was delayed by amazon fresh i checked it on blinkit and got it in 5 minutes meanwhile the original amazon order is now more than 36 hrs old and there is no option to cancel it on amazon i really wonder how they amazon fresh are still alive as a division never had good experience with amazon fresh better stick to blinkit or bb","5":"indias grocery wars a deloitte

pune i never heard of  gun violence or shooting \n \nam thinking should i go back to canada or just stay in india when i see in india everyone is crazy to migrate to canada  maybe i couldnt adjust to canadian culture but in first place i never knew whats canadian culture  i faced lot of racism as well in toronto as i worked with lot of immigrants who recently migrated 23 years so couldnt learn anything canadian  i tried going to meetup to mingle felt i wasnt welcome i dont have a single front toronto everyone is so calculative \n\ni only met one person in 8 years who told he was born in toronto   this post is all about my experience so dont think about saying negative about canada  why would you want to leave your happy place  \n\nyou are a citizen and have the option to move when it make sense to you canada has other cities and provinces though tech jobs and climate might not be to your liking \n\nif you have wfh options look at the wider gta areas where indian communities have come up over the last few years good luck \nsame experience here despite high paying job make 67 times more than avg canadian income mid 6 digit \nthere are racism undertones lack of opportunities to progress further due to immigrant status no culture the multicultural claim is a boogie no history except that they invaded first nation lands and buried them lack of innovation tell me one company similar to apple google or microsoft that was born jn canada free healthcare is delayed stressed out and most people working in healthcare burnt out i work directly in healthcare and many times you may be denied certain important medicines because they are not provincially funded and your extended healthcare coverage do not cover it eg weygovi and several newer cancer drugs\nmost public schools are subpar and you will have to fight with them so that your kids are not bullied or ignored because of their skin color \n\nthe only business or i may even call it scam they do here is immigration bring in young people who have bigger dreams these young people then invest their time and money read educational loans and mortgage in this country so they usually cant go back they then work hard to earn because they have loans to pay back right they pay higher taxes as they earn more but still get blamed for using up infrastructure and healthcare resources research from canada shows that immigrants have significantly lesser healthcare dollar usage compared to nonimmigrants as they are younger and healthier when they immigrate but this fact is hidden from general public\n\njust yesterday my dad asked me he lives jn india but there must be a lot of innovation in canada right my answer was dad the only innovation they have is immigration a dubious scheme of luring young desperate people into this country to take up loans so that banks become richer builders become wealthy and real estate agents can buy 200k worth cars from your money pay exorbitant taxes and then get nothing in return except 56 months of freezing cold and a dream of good life that never materializes because you have to keep on hustling and grinding\n\nstay where you are if you are happy in india this place is deteriorating compared to when i came here a decade ago i am in a similar predicament myself recently\nwell canada didnt work for you so why seek validation from others who may have had a different experience clearly youre happy in india so just continue to pursue what your heart desires\nwell thats cause india is a wonderful place if you have money but if youre a middle class worker in india youre not going to be able to afford the things you afford now nor is your degree from an indian college unless its iit or something as prestigious therefore higher salary than the one you got from canada \n\nmost importantly you have a stronger passport now you have options you can earn in  spend in rupees and dont have to wait an eon and a day for visas and you can afford to travel \n\nas for healthcare again thats cause you have money the avg middle class family has 12 workers supporting children and elderly the healthcare system you scoff at although slow for non emergencies provides high quality care while in india there are good govt hospitals that provide quality medical treatment but youll probably be on a mat in the corridors again unless you have money \n\nso the qol you and other nris enjoy isnt because india is a magical place that others dont recognize its because you just dont live in india even when you do live in india youre living in a bougie bubble wrap india not jostling in the local for 3hrs a day to and from work \n\nthats not to say india is bad or dont move back jsut maybe dont sound so judgmental  others want what you have so that the can live the life youre living theres no need for the oh why do people chase foreign countries our lifestyle here is great a bit hypocritical no \ncanada is not the place it used to be poor migration strategies just made the country worse it was never ready or equipped to handle such mass migration it will take years to recover what has been done you are blessed with a canadian passport so now world is your limit try different countries see what suites you the best and take that decision\n\nalso dont blame indians for dreaming migration its easier to say this with a first world passport in hand many others cant even go to their dream destination on holidays because of the passport just be grateful for what you have and let other dream for what they want","10":"quickcommerce business in

everyday vegetables from station while coming rest remaining prices are so high on mrp that zepto and blinkit give same things at 2030 off directly to home\n\nliving in well developed like thane u get all this dmart zepto buying groceries on kolshet road is easy dozens of road side vendors all the new restaurants like foo jimis burger 4 malls in a city if in dombivli its either 12km away xperia or 56km away metro infact in mumbai also u wont get 23 malls within 23kms 2 halls to watch drama one comdey club decent clubs so many theaters all this matter becoz at night 12pm u can come home if u live in thane \n\nmany cities dont have anything kdmc have 2 decent theater only one drama hall no comdey club at night if u wanna catch long journey train starting or getting off thane would be by far easy than getting down at thane and then going dombivli \n\nalso u can catch early flights 45am with 300400rs by cab from thane but for dombivli it shows 12001500 anytime no cabs even wants to drop at kdmc also \n\nso jokes in on you becoz vasant vihar and pokhran road are too expensive 22k per sq start but u can get home at affordable rest at kolshet also near by metros options are 2 manpada kapurbawdi which are not bad \n\nrest i agree the lodha amara is the worst project among this list i have seen rooms and parking is such a mess but rest kolshet starting projects godrej ascend puranik with dmart near buy are great u get flats with 1415k per sq which is much better than paying 1012k in dombivlikalyan\n\nps  upgrade yourself if you can 1 bhk 5065 2bhk 1  12 cr if u get anywhere till kolshet 6km radius from thane station newold check papers old less than 10yrs buy it\n\nthane is much better package in terms of lifestyle  changes and facilities than kdmc or i cant

name n my flat nofor their online deliveries will i get into any trouble bcz of them using my address i stay in a apartment say abc flat no 101 the apartment next to us doesnt have a name but the people from that apartment flat no 101 use my apartment name n my flat number for all their online deliveries all the orders they place come to us disturb my elders by ringing bell and when we say its not oursthe delivery person calls them and they say not abc come to 101 of adjacent building which is nameless this has been happening since months we told them multiple times not to use our address but they arent listening \n\ncan we get into any trouble because of them using my address because my nri family members have passport bank accounts with this address those idiots usually order from blinkit zepto but im scared what if they order drug meds or any such stuff because the record shows those items are delivered to my address any other suggestions to solve this issue thanks bro 12 times just take their prepaid orders they will stop problem is that you are being too nice\nif the package is prepaid keep it if its cod have it cancelled do this a bunch of times and theyll stop\nyou know talk to them tell them if there is any contraband well have word with police see how they reactif they still do ask the police to come theyll warn and leave\nall delivery apps have a map pin function for delivery house location even if the apartment has no name which is strange how was that flat registration done they can do a drop pin with landmark as besides abc apartment even if this is a genuine difficulty for them they have no right to push their issue to a complete stranger\n\ndefinately withhold items that are delivered to your house if your neighbours look like they dont mind making your house the pickup address then stop giving things to them completely after all legally they have done a gifting delivery to your address enjoy the free items as compensation \ud83d\ude01\neven when delivery guys call to take the parcel back why do you give it\n\njust tip him and give the food back as the order was to your address\n\nask delivery guy to have pics taken with your address door no as proof that way only they will be at loss\nopen the pre paid parcel take them item and send them empty boxes\n\nand write a thank you note inside as they have been so gracious to order for you and you have been rejecting their offerings\n\nfor cod just cancel it saying ordered by mistake\n\nafter 24 cod cancels their account will be blocked for cod in

89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can do it and using ai could even make it better but its difficult to monetize lots of companies have failed to do such things and pivoted into other ideas\n\nthe puzzle to crack here is monetization the feature in itself can be built easily","14":"sanitary pads at ndls \ni recently noticed a facility

significantly degraded in the past month average order times have gone up to 4550 mins ive had to cancel deliveries because no agent was found for upto 90 mins instamart blinkit and zepto seem to have stopped services after midnight zomatos pricing is madness unless you select the 19 rupee priority delivery your order will take an hour  edited comment from earlier\n\nthe services provided by delivery companies has more marginal cost than what we are pay because vcs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden quick refunds more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup\n\nmany vcs now know that the market size for these services in india is small so vc funding is drying up to remain alive these companies now need to become profitable for that they need to try and extract that marginal cost this can be through\n\n1 smaller fleets to reduce cost this causes delivery times to go up\n2 bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size this again causes delivery times to go up\n3 asking extra money if bunching isnt opted by customers\n4 saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons this causes customer support quality to go down extra checks on claims asking for pics emails etc\n5 increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue\n6 hiking prices on subscriptions because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service it is counter intuitive but true\n\nthe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies i use swiggy and bbinstant a lot it has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak\nthey are grouping order nowadays in last 34 months ive had delivery person going in opposite direction coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls trying to search through my order in their bag turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me\u00a0\nat least blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem their warehouse is very close to my apartment less than 500 meters and folks are sitting idle on their bikes usually but when i try to order on app it says over 2 hours due to high transactions\nyeah they are getting worse \n\nwatch this videoenshittification\nthey is different between business and

can atleast get a delivery bag \n\nafter few hours i spoke to their representative and informed them regarding the same and asked them to provide the delivery bag to the poor delivery guy coz the bag he was using is not hygenic i have also requested them to arrange the return of the items if possible coz it had veggies milk etc and i dont feel like using it as it wasnt delivered in a hygenic bag

him he never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates this stupidity made me fall into a 15x bigger debt trap than what i had helped him with other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap my dog met with an accident the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didnt give us deposit amount in return broker ran away with our money

ever let me stand up and come out of this\n\nwhats my current status\u00a0i was in total debt of 15 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me i called my father and told him about my situation i couldnt tell him everything because in a conversation over a call he thought that i was too stressed and might harm myself i didnt wanted to give him more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks everything is clear but its not i cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as i was capable of i

spent over 60k on my sbi cb card this month due to high expenses in my household i went through my spend analyzer and most of my transactions are as follows\n\n1 food delivery approx 16k using park to get vouchers for zomato or buying directly from swiggy or magicpin\n\n2 groceries 6k from zepto blinkit bb etc\n\n3 traveling 10k redbus irctc and goibio\n\n4 ecommerce 15k mostly on cred amazon fkor various websites often paying through gateways like razorpay mobikwik and amazon pay\n\n5 the rest are just offline spends  petrol and maybe utility \n\ni only received rs 1200 as cashback when it should be over 2000 something is wrong and i cannot see how much cashback each transaction has earned like i can on icici or hdfc card statements\n\nplease let me know how to proceed with this any advice is appreciated you need to do manual calculation this is what i do you get the cashback amount in the app after 2 days from the date of transaction thats the only way to keep a track of cashback you can maybe share the statement screenshot here for this month and then only people would be able to help you with it\nyoull have to post your statement only then someone can say anything in this regard\ni simply use this card only online merchants were i know i get 5 cb\n\nso if my bill is 40k i just check whether it is roughly 5 of 40k  2k\nbuilt a chrome extension for this

saturday on okies suggestion and a lot of discussion i got the l55 must say nicely made razor \n\nwhen you compare the knurling its quite smooth isnt as rough as the ricardo anyways coming to the shave\n\nblade  7 oclock super platinum \nrazor  l55 oc \ncream  heavenly sandalwood by pink wolf \nafsl  pink wolf nice cooling burn \npre shave oil  coconut oil  navaranthana thanda thanda cool cool oil  awesome feel tho and great slickness \nface wash  vetiver soap by kpn \n\nso as usually whipped the cream and man the cooling effect just because of the camphor menthol in the oil brilliant plus menthol in the cream real good feel \n\nwashed the razor and plugged the stroke and i immediately notice something it isnt aggressive at all for me despite a open comb its so gentle that it just glides even with a 7 oclock \n\ndidnt feel the blade at all so 3 passes as usual wtg  xtg atg finished it with alum and took a bath and finally finished with pink woolf afsl \n\nbbs shave but definitely not a aggressive razor real mild tbh \n\nalso decided to make a stand for the brush failed miserably looks shaby tho \n\nin my opening of its your first time getting a razor go for this any day \n\nbut if you want that kurr kurr feedback get a kenem x adjustable except for the fact that its grip is pathetic and if have to keep your hands dry most of the shave with this its always a sure grip \n\nout of the topic of shave  still ricardo hasnt reached kamlesh well thats the state of package delivery in this country slow and pathetic unless its amazon or blinkit   awesome shave glad that you finally have a second razor in hand and also that you liked it so much the l55 is such a cool razor brilliantly benign and yet so efficient it is incredible\n\nwe have to have a bonfire in the woods in honour of your ricardo the day when it finally gets delivered well all dress like tribals and dance around the fire all night hehehehehe\nsuperb shave\n\numurkystrike  looks like pearl has changed the open comb head as well both heads are milder now \n\nhow intriguing thanks for the review\n\nlove the effort for the brush holder\nnice shave  writeup    \nill suggest to use good quality oils as its ur face eg virgin coconut oil if coconut only you want almonds oil or whatever suits you but not possibly chemical laden like navratan\nnice shave and you have a great idea and

to my doorstep with my essentials reality a solid 1520 varna minutes later for the uninitiated varna time works like dog yearsmultiply by three my order finally arrived\n\nthinking this was a oneoff glitch i reached out to zeptos customer service big mistake heres how that went\n\t1\tcustomer service attempt 1 were trying to contact the rider\ntranslation weve lost the rider please send thoughts and prayers\n\t2\tcustomer service attempt 2 the rider went to the wrong location\ntranslation our gps works about as well as our delivery times\n\t3\tcustomer service attempt 3 crickets\ntranslation weve decided to ghost you\n\nto add insult to injury the apps order history mysteriously stopped loadingeverything else worked fine but not the one feature i needed coincidence i think not\n\ndetermined to validate my experience i ran a little experiment today same order same 5minute promise result a 35minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport meanwhile blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutesand actually deliver within that timeframe shocking i know\n\nso dear zepto is this your new business strategy lure us in with false promises frustrate us with disappearing riders and then leave us questioning our life choices if so its working brilliantly\n\nscreenshots enclosed because sometimes you just need receipts to cope both are 15 mins apart but see the time difference on the app they are very clever to ensure the phones time is not displayed while youre on the app \ud83d\ude42 its the same case with blinkit and instamart they say 7 of 9 mins delivery and then your order will come whenever convenient to them not that i didnt mind getting my order in 15  20 mins but why promise such a false time of delivery","28":"zomato ceo offering job to a bengaluru manager from a tweet   recently the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company zomato announced an initiative food rescue to limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their mamma got \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udca2\nthose were such basic observations\nif zomato didnt even think about those before implementing the feature god save them","29":"looking for decent 2nd credit card

delivery guy call in which they made my order not returnable then i again order something and i told the delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it i am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead they even hit us and tried to fight with us i just wanted to share this bc the thing havent gone this far if the zomato had improved there customer support you did kinda wrong by placing multiple orders and refusing it \n\nim not saying they were right what they did also

conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the

suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be

interested folks to invest or want to share the feedback i am open my idea is as follows\n\ngoal to deliver goodsurgent supplements within the city with reduced time and reduced delivery cost\n\n\u00a0\n\nthis can be done by using drones as follows\n\n1 when the agencyshopetc receive any order they will put the order in the drone baggage compartment\n2 the drone is automatically receives customer destination and how to reach there\n3 the path drone follows is the main usp for this total project\n4 the backend algorithm collabs with the ride apps such as uberola etc\n   1 the algorithm works as follows\n   2 the algorithms gets track of all the live rides going on with the ride appsref point4\n   3 then calculates the nearest point where drone can get on the vehicles participating in the live rides\n   4 the drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicleautocabetc to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top\n   5 during the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone\n      1 scenario 1 if vehicle stuck in traffic then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer\n      2 scenario 2 when vehicle is taking different route than the destination then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle\n\n\u00a0\n\n this method is useful in cases of emergencies medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time\n the business like zeptoblinkit can reduce their dark stores\n the delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part\n the complications happens from the drones can be reduced\n\ni hope i can get lot of insights from talented people out there nopes will not work indians would just shoot the drone down and steal the packages\ndeleted\ni have practical exposure to this industry though i dont have funds to invest but can execute operations for you if help is needed get in touch\nnah dont even try in this space too many many ppl tried and failed after spending too many millions\nwhy does a drone need to be mounted on top of the car what is the core problem youre solving \n\nyoure providing a complicated solution but not focussing on the core problem

a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading  in general i hate the tam discussion because vcs use it to kill investment right away its an easylogical no from them \n\nin reality its a double edged sword airbnb and uber both started with tiny tams and found ways to grow into massive businesses cocacola expanded their tam once they started to view themselves as a fnb company not just a soda company \n\nbut its hard to build a big business with a nonexistent tam you should run some numberswhat is a reasonable som obtainable market how big can that business be \n\nthen you need a story on how youll expand into a larger tam\nunderstanding your tam is important as is your unit economics\u00a0\n\ndo you want to build a startup as opposed to just starting a business where you dont need to raise capital and dont intend to hire more than a handful of people\n\nif you want to build a startup your tam needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage but not too big that theres a tonne of competition\n\nyour unit economics need to stack up against the tam in your example lets say theres a pool of 1m people that would pay 30 twice a year to try a new tech toy your tam is 60m\n\nthis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 3050 of the market\n\nso lets look at unit economics required to win millions of customers  eg youd be getting 60 per customer per year but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer\u00a0you probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers whats it cost to get your ad in front of a million people\n\nand then how long do they stay a customer eg what is the ltv\n\nwe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework youre in the low importance low frequency box this is the worst box to be in\n\nso its a small tam high cost of customer acquisition high churn \u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions\n\nso would i get hung up on tam no but if the tam is small you want the other factors to be good if everything is bad then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea\ndepending on what stage of the startup youre on tams can work however the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if youre revenue model makes sense and youre able to show low acquisition costs high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real tam assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe som however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular  its really the calculation of what if any the series a will look like\n\nat early stage 1 should get you something stupid like 1 in revenue if they are asking for 1m seed to hit 1m in revenue you have a series a candidate if their som is something bigger like 100m and all they need is 5 m preseed but the dont have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their som is 1m but need 2m to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nthe tam for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\ncltv and cac are probably a much more telling exercise than the tam sam som\n\nbtw nearly 90 of our nos are based on our assessment of a weak founding team 9 of our nos are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand call back when you get some 1 may include the tam discussion posited in the post\nneed to know tam as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale easier to be a 100m company with a tam of 100b than a tam of 200m\n\nbut in reality tam is very easy to manipulate and enlarge if you are airbnb you may have picked the private bb market as your tam but the expand to private shortterm rentals and tam is much bigger then expand into hotels and its huge now go global\n\nto me a tam is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything\n\ni am working on an ai  human chat serviceplatform i am broadening the focus to service support and sales that expands potential market significantly then adding a human layer likely means i can also cater to enterprise so from smb to large enterprise i am actually too broad and need to sort this out but tam is helpful","43":"opinion on the service offered by bigbasketblinkitinstamart etc how was the service are the fruits and vegetables are selected properly before delivery i want to try bigbasket anything to keep in mind before ordering do they accept upi at the time of delivery one problem with bigbasket is if you have multiple addresses in your account please make sure that you choose the right address manually at the beginning of your session on the app also please make sure that the right address has been carried forward to the order summary page just before payment bigbasket isnt as intuitive as the other apps and so one assumes that the right address based on ones location is correctly selected but that isnt the case happy shopping \nabout the other two theyve got exorbitantly priced broccoli lettuce and other exotic veggies that are reasonably priced in other cities theyve got to work on improving their selection of veggies\nnone available in my area","44":"guys did i got scam  today i order first time on blinkit i ordered icecream and sweetbut when the delivery boy came he was a man

guys im a developer whos looking to work on some app which would be useful to a lot of day to day indians but cant seem to come up with any fruitful idea so far since most of the major ideas seem to be quite congested and taken up by major players such as social media ig facebook twitter ordering food zomato swiggy ride hailing uber ola namma yatri rapido groceries delivery zepto blinkit etc wanted to know your opinion on what could be ideas for apps which an indian audience would need in todays time theres an app called ground news its relatively new and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication how many times the story has been shared by known conservative or liberal media how each side of the spectrum showsheadlines the news and tries to catch misinformation \nits made in the us and our landscape is quite different to theirs so im not sure how it fares here but something like that for india i think would do well with the younger crowd i personally find it very intriguing \n\nexecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe itll help spark something new\ncan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust  also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the coaching containing video streaming chats question solving etc feature\nhow about an app that compares prizes in real time hailing a ride compare prices from uber vs ola ordering food compare prices from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant similarly for grocery delivery i dont know if any of these platforms have apis that you can utilize for this and that could make this idea a little tricky to implement\nan app to pay all bills in one shot every month\nyou should try faith tech such as astrology applications its a huge space in india and have immense pull factor\nyou can use vision tech to do palmistry and and signatures","46":"ideas upon which an app can be built for an indian

vast majority of the indian audience ie india ii  india iii  would suggest gaming andor betting apps being a lowincome country folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too indisciplined to adopt productivity apps let alone pay subscription fees for them furthermore if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is  people spend hours in local trains  buses it is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports betting apps etc looking for instant gratification or quick money neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use

anyone gives a damn even if they get to know that youre using a massager for toe curling fun unless they get ideas of forcibly including themselves into the scene with yourself  for which the only

couldnt find a flair that matched\n\ni ordered some groceries on blinkit and the order which was  supposed to be delivered in 17 minutes was late by 10 or so minutes the guy called me and told me he was outside my apartment near a white car i asked him to wait there and went down there was nobody there i waited for 2 minutes and then went back home because i had something on the stove i called him back and asked him where he was he told me the name of a different apartment i told him that wasnt the location and gave him directions while im on the phone i can hear him getting directions from someone on the road in between all of this he kept apologizing and starting every sentence with thappa nenachukkaadheenga\n\na couple of minutes later i open the door randomly to see if hes there yet and see a collegeaged guy standing right outside hesitating he apologizes again tells me hes new and starts taking out my things from his bag thats when i notice his brand new blinkit bag and realise how new he is i ask him if todays his first day and he smiles and says yes as soon as he handed over everything he asks me whether ive paid online again with the customary thappa nenachukkaadheenga i tell him i have and show him my phone he thanks me and tells me this was his first delivery ever i wish him all the best and as he turns to leave i see him smiling to himself not the normal smile you know how sometimes when youre pleased with yourself or thinking of something really nice and theres nobody to see you you smile this really happy smile to yourself right that smile \n\nthis was a

opening of this cafe\n\nit was very cold 10 degrees and he was standing still with eerie silence there were quite a few people inside this cafe of the same age as that of the delivery guy and they were partying playing snooker and drinking coffee right in front of that window opening\n\nhe must have completed his last deliveries nearby as his electric scooter was parked nearby i passed just next to him and he didnt even flinch or even notice\n\nthere was music and noise coming from inside of the cafe but there was absolute silence outside where he was standing\n\nreminds me to stay humble and appreciate little things in life hope i stay grateful for the things this universe has provided me\n\ni hope he gets to visit this cafe someday with his friends if he has any and enjoy a good day there \n\nps i couldnt do anything to help him im a student and hes better off earning by working hard as delivery person so theres nothing i could have really done its crazy how many of us take things for granted whether its money relationships or anything else gratitude is what we need because there is always someone else praying for the life we already have we have food clothes a house to live in while a homeless person is sleeping under a bridge with an empty stomach\n\ngratitude people gratitude\na punch of motivation for me whenever i feel low i remember \n\n\napna hi dukh dekha hai tumne\nbot kam dekha hai tumne\nreminds me of a line i read somewhere that went like do not mock a pain you havent endured\nlife is never fair there is always someone better than  you and always someone below you just today only i was feeling jealous of my friend whose parents sent him abroad  while i couldnt afford that but this picture now humbled me sometimes we become so busy in creating unnecessary problems that we forgot to appreciate what we have and its dream of so many to just be where you are now\nwhat a deep picture \ud83e\udd7a","63":"blinkit which was acquired by zomato in a 2022 deal valued at 568 million is now evaluated at a staggering 13 billion by goldman sachs surpassing deepinder goyalled zomatos core food delivery business  why is the picture showing deepinder shocked if its more valuable its good for zomato also\nthis maybe similar to what happened to byjus the valuation seems absurd the quick delivery companies wont be profitable in the near future \nthe valuation will definitely fall\nare they profitable now\nits like saying iphone 15 has higher sales than iphone 15 pro max \n\nboth the phone sales money goes to apple so it doesnt matter which model generate more money \ud83e\udd11 only thing matters is the phones are getting sold\nbasically blinkit is now more valued than zomato","64":"blinkit launches bistro a quick food delivery

mini warehouses are sprouting up in residential neighbourhoods replacing kiranas\n\nson of a former shopkeeper in our area is now a blinkit delivery guy  my local kirana shop has started his own quick commerce brand through whatsapp he has a guy who delivers milk paneer vegetables and rations to our houses\ni think kiranas will be fine quick commerce is burning cash to build customer base they will start becoming expensive which we have seen with swiggyzomato kiranas have to ride the storm\ni remember reading similar news items predicting dooms day for mom and pop stores throughout the last decade keep in mind  flipkart was founded in 2007 it had its first big billion day sales 2014 we are in 2024 and still the share of ecom is 10 of total retail spend in india\na week ago i read somewhere blinkit is about to start a service where you can buy clothes that will be delivered in 10 mins and if you want to return them it will take 30 mins \n\nwe are doomed\nfssai sucks at keeping track of and punishing people who copy brands and deliver fake goods the blinkit store near my house has been giving us fake goods we just realised if theres no regulation the wise customers will move back to the local kirana stores \nthats my hope anyway\n\neta i knew from monaco one packet was from the salt flats of bolivia the kirana store one was from the actual company tasted normal","67":"instead of worrying whether swiggy or zomata or other quick commerce companies will perform i just sit back and invest in companies that provide packaging papers to these companiesproxy companies seriously why ruin my mental health by having misgivings about the risedownfall of certain quick commerce companieswhether swiggyblinkit or zepto will ultimately become the market leader when i can just invest in a proxy company\n\nseeing the rise in quick commerce in india i decided to invest in a paper companywhich i will not name this is a multibagger in the makingfrom my pov  \n  \nyou know how you get your productsfood by an amazonswiggy delivery boy in a package right they supply this packaging paper and is a fundamentally strong companythe stock is also undervalued while these quick commerce companies fight tooth and nail for market share in this competitive industry pudumjee provides the supply of paper to carry out their deliveries which has resulted in an explosion in their their earnings\n\nthis post is not a recommendation to buy or sell its just to share the benefits of investing in proxy companies \nif you havent already please add your own analysisopinions

approach like more than the vaccine look out for ancillaries providing the glass and syringe for it \nwhen everyone is digging for gold this guy is selling shovels\nquiet wrong or correct approach means you need to understand\n\n1wrong approach  what can go wrong\n\n1when ever market goes down  the backend companies are most affected by recession\n\n2 the proxy companies can change there supplier anyday depending on there cost\n\n3 growth of suppliers is not as good as the proxy companies had\n\n4imp finding these companies is pretty hard and tricky most of the time you can get targeted by scams or hit by low performing asset\n\n2 the correct approach\n\n1the best way it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is not affected by the operations of a single one\n\n3good and well connected management unlike big companies here connections matter the most as the vendor need huge friend network inside big corporates to reach for there products\n\n3 benefits\n\n1 once business is well settled it will give really good benefits in long run\nso does it mean that pudumjee\u00a0is a monopoly or are there are also other players in the race\n\nanyhow i took a similar approach for ddev plastiks since the company makes cable compounds and plastic compounds that are used in cable and wire packaging footwear pipes automobiles consumer durables electrical appliances electrical and light fittings and electronics\n\nits also the only domestic player manufacturing coating compounds for 132 kv cables with rest being imported increasing house sales and infrastructures such as metro stations hospitals schools are the growth opportunities for this industry and company\n\nbut the share price is not going up and instead steadily decreasing any ideassuggestions regarding what approach i should take here\n\nim hoping for decent q2 results so that the share price increases a little and at least does not fall further","68":"qcomm vs madiwala market price comparison the price we pay for convenience is not so small tldr quick commerce is charging too much sometimes double the price for essential vegetables when compared to local market\n\nlike most of us i used to order everything on blinkit i was so used to the convenience q comm offered i never bothered going to madiwala market which is hardly 500 meters from where i stay\u00a0\n\nowing to scale of operations and purchasing power i always assumed these players will be able to give at a price comparable with the local market maybe charge a small premium for the convenience\u00a0\n\nbut today a casual stroll through madiwala market was a huge surprise to me\n\ni couldnt believe i was paying more than 100 of the market price for onions green chillies and lemon almost all the vegetables which i buy regularly were being sold at upwards of 40 premium  on top of this they charge delivery fees and all the absurd convenience fees \n\nthis is ridiculous with inflation at a 15 month high frequent visits to your local market can go a long way in protecting and growing your savings\u00a0\n\nmy analysis in comments as imgur link is it just me who read qualcomm\nnow youll tell that the prices in the menu in restaurants are lower compared to the one in swiggyzomato \n\nthats the basics of quick commerce you are paying a premium for the convenience of sitting at home and having stuff delivered at your doorstep in some cases its 20 and others 100\nquick commerce is really good for every item other than fruits and vegetable madivalabommahalli was anyway always cheaper local shops near sarjapur bellandur and hsr charge almost same price as quick commerce\n\ni will suggest you to start using zepto super saver you will stopped doing any groceryfruits shopping from outside only cons is min 1000 order\ni tried ordering an ice cream cake from ibaco for which

i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with inapp payments\n\t\tproduct quality\n\nits a simple idea but i think it could really work if executed well","73":"swiggy instamart is really helpful sorry for off topic but i wanted to share this i usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy this incident made me reconsider my thoughts\n\ni typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab since its raining in bengaluru i need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else i would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella\n\n the concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up\n\nits the after sales support im worried about no checking or returns at doorstep selling old expired or near expiry items returned and repackaged or seal broken and used items irresponsible customer care agents\n\nthats sorta things\neverything is worth it if you have money and people like those on this sub often can trade money for convenience\nwell of course billions of dollars are being poured by vcs into this industry theyre not fools to be so bullish on this for no reason \n\nside note how are you able to walk the distance thats equivalent to almost 300 cab fare\nyeah we had a 40hour power outage here because of the cyclone so i ordered a power bank from instamart with extra discount and 10 cashback  fully charged saved my phones battery from dying\nmy dad works on a laptop which doesnt have a functioning keyboard so he uses external keyboard one day that stopped working as well my dad wasnt well and i work in another city i could have purchased from amazon but even with prime they hardly ever deliver within a day other option was to go to market  \ni dont use instant delivery services much but somehow decided to look up on blinkit and found several options keyboard got delivered within 8 minutes","74":"is it weird how safe i felt in blinkit bhaiyas arms \n\nso basically i wanted to go to zudio for buying some clothes and was feeling lazy

plan to become profitable im starting to see rs 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members this could be across india but im seeing it already here in bengaluru where lots of people order groceries even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs 599 which isnt something ill be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase seems to me that if this starts making them enough money other apps will follow zepto is currently the only one without big backing  blinkit has zomato bigbasket has tata instamart has swiggy and milkbasket has reliance and theyre facing difficulty in getting funding but seems to me like id rather go to a grocery store now where i can get better discounts which ive been doing since theyve

grocery delivery among families and bachelors here \n\nedit i was born and brought up in bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown for urgent needs ive always gone to

pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like zepto im saying its a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy zepto was making losses and they were burning vc pe money\n\nbut that era is coming to an end\n\nit is never possible to deliver at the costs they did earlier forgot profits extreme losses but they had backing of vc pe money\n\nthat money is drying out fast\ni agree for small purchases now ive gone back to visiting local shops and buying from there not gonna pay 2x the orders cost in delivery fees and platform fees and

these quick delivery apps like blinkit and zepto survive longterm so i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free delivery\nhere to stay but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other channels highly possible that we will see more logistics companies coming up soon to deliver locally for restaurants mncs directly instead of working with q commerce"}]],"1":[[{"negative":0.9317483902,"neutral":0.0606274344,"positive":0.0076241512,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"is it normal for blinkit

for delivery are actually handled by amazon fresh\n\ntwice i opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so called rush deliveries are handled by amazon fresh i then realized why they were getting delayed amazon fresh has always been crap since day 1 the worst part is they wont even let you cancel an amazon fresh order even if it has not been dispatched \n\nso if you are ordering something from amazon never choose any of the time slots your order will be then handled by amazon fresh and you will be sorry you chose them\n\nas a side note always check the item on blinkit before ordering from amazon their sku has expanded significantly the order which was delayed by amazon fresh i checked it on blinkit and got it in 5 minutes meanwhile the original amazon order is now more than 36 hrs old and there is no option to

\n\nam indian middle class who came as a student and the got job of 90k my english is not good i worked as developer in td \n\ni migrated to canada and really struggled badly in toronto lived there from 20182022 since  2022 am living in india i feel life here is much more relaxed i can afford much stuff here delivery apps like blinkit and zepto are bliss i can afford eating out in restaurants and bar toronto i couldnt afford most of the resturant also am a typical middle class indian guy so my eating habits are not westernized but again continental and other cuisines were very expensive i dont eat porkbeef or seafood so that was a challenge in finding variety restaurants were very expensive  forced tipping \n\ni got treated with some prolong health issue in india as i couldnt  get appointment for 6 months in toronto  wondering why people consider canada having high living standard   is this false picture painted by 90s nri family at work i see everyone wants to move to canada  \ni stayed in scarborough and drivers were crazy crime rate was high in my life first time i heard gun shots on lawrence and don mills in pune i never heard of  gun violence or shooting \n \nam thinking should i go back to canada or just stay in india when i see in india everyone is crazy to migrate to canada  maybe i couldnt adjust to canadian culture but in first place i never knew whats canadian culture  i faced lot of racism as well in toronto as i worked with lot of immigrants who recently migrated 23 years so couldnt learn anything canadian  i tried going to meetup to mingle felt i wasnt welcome i dont have a single front toronto everyone is so calculative \n\ni only met one person in 8 years who told he was born in toronto   this post is all about my experience so dont think about saying negative about canada  why would you want to leave your happy place  \n\nyou are a citizen and have the option to move when it make sense to you canada has other cities and provinces though tech jobs and climate might not be to your liking \n\nif you have wfh options look at the wider gta areas where indian communities have come up over the last few years good luck \nsame experience here despite high paying job make 67 times more than avg canadian income mid 6 digit \nthere are racism undertones lack of opportunities to progress further due to immigrant status no culture the multicultural claim is a boogie no history except that they invaded first nation lands and buried them lack of innovation tell me one company similar to apple google or microsoft that was born jn canada free healthcare is delayed stressed out and most people working in healthcare burnt out i work directly in healthcare and many times you may be denied certain important medicines because they are not provincially funded and your extended healthcare coverage do not cover it eg weygovi and several newer cancer drugs\nmost public schools are subpar and you will have to fight with them so that your kids are not bullied or ignored because of their skin color \n\nthe only business or i may even call it scam they do here is immigration bring in young people who have bigger dreams these young people then invest their time and money read educational loans and mortgage in this country so they usually cant go back they then work hard to earn because they have loans to pay back right they pay higher taxes as they earn more but still get blamed for using up infrastructure and healthcare resources research from canada shows that immigrants have significantly lesser healthcare dollar usage compared to nonimmigrants as they are younger and healthier when they immigrate but this fact is hidden from general public\n\njust yesterday my dad asked me he lives jn india but there must be a lot of innovation in canada right my answer was dad the only innovation they have is immigration a dubious scheme of luring young desperate people into this country to take up loans so that banks become richer builders become wealthy and real estate agents can buy 200k worth cars from your money pay exorbitant taxes and then get nothing in return except 56 months of freezing cold and a dream of good life that never materializes because you have to keep on hustling and grinding\n\nstay where you are if you are happy in india this place is deteriorating compared to when i came here a decade ago i am in a similar predicament myself recently\nwell canada didnt work for you so why seek validation from others who may have had a different experience clearly youre happy in india so just continue to pursue what your heart desires\nwell thats cause india is a wonderful place if you have money but if youre a middle class worker in india youre not going to be able to afford the things you afford now nor is your degree from an indian college unless its iit or something as prestigious therefore higher salary than the one you got from canada \n\nmost importantly you have a stronger passport now you have options you can earn in  spend in rupees and dont have to wait an eon and a day for visas and you can afford to travel \n\nas for healthcare again thats cause you have money the avg middle class family has 12 workers supporting children and elderly the healthcare system you scoff at although slow for non emergencies provides high quality care while in india there are good govt hospitals that provide quality medical treatment but youll probably be on a mat in the corridors again unless you have money \n\nso the qol you and other nris enjoy isnt because india is a magical place that others dont recognize its because you just dont live in india even when you do live in india youre living in a bougie bubble wrap india not jostling in the local for 3hrs a day to and from work \n\nthats not to say india is bad or dont move back jsut maybe dont sound so judgmental  others want what you have so that the can live the life youre living theres no need for the oh why do people chase foreign countries our lifestyle here is great a bit hypocritical no \ncanada is not the place it used to be poor migration strategies just made the country worse it was never ready or equipped to handle such mass migration it will take years to recover what has been done you are blessed with a canadian passport so now world is your limit try different countries see what suites you the best and take that decision\n\nalso dont blame indians for dreaming migration its easier to say this with a first world passport in hand many others cant even go to their dream destination on holidays because of the passport just be grateful for what you have and let other dream for what they want"}]],"10":[[{"negative":0.5353189707,"neutral":0.206946522,"positive":0.2577344775,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"quickcommerce business in guwahati need tech partner i am a businessperson in guwahati

guwahatithe problem is that when big players like zepto blinkit or instamart enters guwahati you will cease to exist moreover its not tech only its ops heavy and building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party api costs would be huge and also i think you are familiar with their warehouse models too so theres another huge expense tbh so good luck\n\ncoming to tech part its not a single guy work if its gonna be in a small period of time u need a proper team atleast one senior guy and some devs and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate so initial funding is therefore needed anyways good luck on your journey and feel free to dm im mostly in tech part anyways\nthere are whitelabel food delivery apps that you

was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can

now know that the market size for these services in india is small so vc funding is drying up to remain alive these companies now need to become profitable for that they need to try and extract that

up\n3 asking extra money if bunching isnt opted by customers\n4 saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons this causes customer support quality to go down extra checks on claims asking for pics emails etc\n5 increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue\n6 hiking prices on subscriptions because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more

me\u00a0im a 24yearold from ahmedabad gujarat  found this community much more active and understanding so posting my concern here  ive done a diploma in computer engineering but had to drop out from my b tech 2nd year due to some personal reasons i dont have any highpaying jobs since i have any skills that can get me a decent job but with some basic skills im making good enough to pay my bills currently im trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else and the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap\n\nhow i fall into a debt trap\u00a0i tried to be a nice guy in covid times and i helped my brotherlike best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black covid days but i never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life i helped him with all my savings and investments from stokes i was a fool and for the sake of friendship i helped him he never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates this stupidity made me fall into a 15x bigger debt trap than what i had helped him with other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap my dog met with an accident the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didnt give us deposit amount in return broker ran away with our money i met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine got scammed by someone worth of 10000 and still never got it back since the bank is sbi and we know how it works recently my 160 worth of crypto got stolen which i had received for completing tasks and that was literally my last money in hand  such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this\n\nwhats my current status\u00a0i was in total debt of 15 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me i called my father and told him about my situation i couldnt tell him everything because in a conversation over a call he thought that i was too stressed and might harm myself i didnt wanted to give him more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks everything is clear but its not i cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as i was capable of i worked as a blinkit delivery partner i worked for one youtuber and so on\n\nnow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only 90000 is what i need on urgent basis the rest amount is from some close people whore never gonna ask for it back but ill return it asap i save something\n\nwhats in that 90000\n\n16000\u00a0ring power loan  from instant loan app  overdue of 15 days and theyre constantly calling every 5 min and knocking on my door every day if i dont repay it tonight by 9 theyll reach my parents house in my hometown and that would be a disaster for my life my father will never talk to me again and my girlfriend who has supported me in this bad time i wont be able to marry without my parents permission i dont want to lose the love of my life and neither the respect of my parents just for a small amount of money\n\n13000  19000  13000\u00a0i had borrowed this from known people but as i promised them to pay last month i couldnt pay them and now theyre constantly calling me and want their money back i cant keep them ignoring or they might talk to any of my brothers or father about this yes i know im late and im really capable of paying them this amount instantly and theyre not ready to wait for a few days\n\nthe rest is small fractions of the amounts and that will take a very long paragraph to explain the story\n\nhow ill pay back\u00a0ive applied for the rapido captain job no matter what happens ill do my best to make 1500 a day from rapido it might sound hard but ive to do it and ill do it along with that ive a small work from one youtuber that pays me 9000 a month and a small source of income is affiliate income which can pay my daily bills so whatever ill earn from rapido and other gigs ill keep on paying it every week within 34 months ill surely clear this with whoever kindhearted person hear to help me\n\nmen can understand the pain and shame of asking for money from your father or someone else when youre all capable of earning writing this post makes me feel so guilty but if i had any other option i wouldnt be writing here right im all on my own im trying my best but the pressure of paying for everything on time and the stress of other stuff is not letting me focus on my learnings i dont blame anyone for this situation im the only person whos responsible for this im not really a fraud person im seeking genuine help please help me out and i wont forget you guys for my life\n\neven today when i call my parents they never fails to ask me that ab toh sab thik hai na mummy is like kuch ho toh bata dena aur bada mat kar dena wapis tere papa befizul ka tension lete rehte hai how im supposed to say her that nothing is okay im stuck at the last stage ive come really far and almost at the door step of a

received rs 1200 as cashback when it should be over 2000 something is wrong and i cannot see how much cashback each transaction has earned like i can on icici or hdfc card statements\n\nplease let me know how to proceed with this any advice is appreciated you need to do manual calculation this is what i do you get the cashback amount in the app after 2 days from the date of transaction thats the only way to keep a track of cashback you can maybe share the statement screenshot here for this month and then only people would be able to help you with it\nyoull have to post your statement only

bengaluru manager from a tweet   recently the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company zomato announced an initiative food rescue to limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their

delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the

for system design interviews and created a hld for instamartblinkit please review it and suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n namaste\nthanks for submitting to

want to work on this idea if any interested folks to invest or want to share the feedback i am open my idea is as follows\n\ngoal to deliver goodsurgent supplements within the city with reduced time and reduced delivery cost\n\n\u00a0\n\nthis can be done by using drones as follows\n\n1 when the agencyshopetc receive any order they will put the order in the drone baggage compartment\n2 the drone is automatically receives customer destination and how to reach there\n3 the path drone follows is the main usp for this total project\n4 the backend algorithm collabs with the ride apps such as uberola etc\n   1 the algorithm works as follows\n   2 the algorithms gets track of all the live rides going on with the ride appsref point4\n   3 then calculates the nearest point where drone can get on the vehicles participating in the live rides\n   4 the drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicleautocabetc to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top\n   5 during the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone\n      1 scenario 1 if vehicle stuck in traffic then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer\n      2 scenario 2 when vehicle is taking different route than the destination then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle\n\n\u00a0\n\n this method is useful in cases of emergencies medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time\n the business like zeptoblinkit can reduce their dark stores\n the delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part\n the complications happens from the drones can be reduced\n\ni hope i can get lot of insights from talented people out there nopes will not work indians would just shoot the drone down and steal the packages\ndeleted\ni have practical exposure

assess before you invest your money and time in a venture in the unknown but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche yet in the grand scheme of things it can be a brilliant productservice users probably dont know they needed it but they do if its executed correctly\n\ni have been building a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading  in general i hate the tam discussion because vcs use it to kill investment right away its an easylogical no from them \n\nin reality its a double edged sword airbnb and uber both started with tiny tams and found ways to grow into massive businesses cocacola expanded their tam once they started to view themselves as a fnb company not just a soda company \n\nbut its hard to build a big business with a nonexistent tam you should run some numberswhat is a reasonable som obtainable market how big can that business be \n\nthen you need a story on how youll expand into a larger tam\nunderstanding your tam is important as is your unit economics\u00a0\n\ndo you want to build a startup as opposed to just starting a business where you dont need to raise capital and dont intend to hire more than a handful of people\n\nif you want to build a startup your tam needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage but not too big that theres a tonne of competition\n\nyour unit economics need to stack up against the tam in your example lets say theres a pool of 1m people that would pay 30 twice a year to try a new tech toy your tam is 60m\n\nthis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 3050 of the market\n\nso lets look at unit economics required to win millions of customers  eg youd be getting 60 per customer per year but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer\u00a0you probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers whats it cost to get your ad in front of a million people\n\nand then how long do they stay a customer eg what is the ltv\n\nwe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework youre in the low importance low frequency box this is the worst box to be in\n\nso its a small tam high cost of customer acquisition high churn \u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions\n\nso would i get hung up on tam no but if the tam is small you want the other factors to be good if everything is bad then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea\ndepending on what stage of the startup youre on tams can work however the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if youre revenue model makes sense and youre able to show low acquisition costs high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real tam assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe som however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular  its really the calculation of what if any the series a will look like\n\nat early stage 1 should get you something stupid like 1 in revenue if they are asking for 1m seed to hit 1m in revenue you have a series a candidate if their som is something bigger like 100m and all they need is 5 m preseed but the dont have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their som is 1m but need 2m to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nthe tam for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\ncltv and cac are probably a much more telling exercise than the tam sam som\n\nbtw nearly 90 of our nos are based on our assessment of a weak founding team 9 of our nos are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand call back when you get some 1 may include the tam discussion posited in the post\nneed to know tam as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale easier to be a 100m company with a tam of 100b than a tam of 200m\n\nbut in reality tam is very easy to manipulate and enlarge if you are airbnb you may have picked the private bb market as your tam but the expand to private shortterm rentals and tam is much bigger then expand into hotels and its huge now go global\n\nto me a tam is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything\n\ni am working on an ai  human chat serviceplatform i am broadening the focus to service support and sales that expands potential market significantly then adding a human layer likely means i can also cater to enterprise so from smb to large enterprise i am actually too broad and need to sort this

youre using a massager for toe curling fun unless they get ideas of forcibly including themselves into the scene with yourself  for which the only solution is to contact the seller and ensuring that they have a discreet packing\n\nand whats more important than the toy is that you get a good anti bacterial lotion to regularly clean it\nhave you checked amazon it would be in a sealed box if they

a startup or not but i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with

affordable grocery delivery apps came on here after hearing and seeing zeptos plan to become profitable im starting to see rs 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members this could be across india but im seeing it already here in bengaluru where lots of people order groceries even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs 599 which isnt something ill be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase seems to me that if this starts making them enough money other apps will follow zepto is currently the only one without big backing  blinkit has zomato bigbasket has tata instamart has swiggy and milkbasket has reliance and theyre facing difficulty in getting funding but seems to me like id rather go to a grocery store now where i can get better discounts which ive been doing since theyve started rolling this out \n\nis it just me or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes is the market too saturated with choices \n\nwhat do you all think how popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here \n\nedit i was born and brought up in bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown for urgent needs ive always gone to the local store next to my apartment or other stores nearby however when im coming back home late at night after work around 910 ive been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like zepto im saying its a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy zepto was making losses and they were burning vc pe money\n\nbut that era is coming to an end\n\nit is never possible to deliver at the costs they did earlier forgot profits extreme losses but they had backing of vc pe money\n\nthat money is drying out fast\ni agree for small purchases now ive gone back to visiting local shops and buying from there not gonna pay 2x the orders cost in delivery fees and platform fees and whatnot"}]],"86":[[{"negative":0.0412188023,"neutral":0.3104771972,"positive":0.6483040452,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"swiggy has released its
