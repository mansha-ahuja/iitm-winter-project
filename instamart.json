And here we are\u2026","1":"Bought Malabar 1g 999 gold @\u20b98299 during the gold sale on Swiggy using HDFC Swiggy card. Received full 10% cashback today, so it worked.

","4":"Sorry for off topic. But I wanted to share this. I usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit, zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy. This incident made me reconsider my thoughts.\n\nI typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab. Since it's raining in Bengaluru, I need an umbrella for tomorrow's office travel. But all shops were closed as I searched nearby. Suddenly I got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart. \n\nAnd surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 Rs. Since I have the Swiggy HDFC CC, I used that too and got additional 28RS cashback. \n\nThen I realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else I would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella.\n\n","5":"Pretty much the title\n\nI am a college student and this is my very first cc, so I am still learning how to make the best use of this card.\nAny other tips or tricks would also be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you","6":"As u can see for all other transactions except zepto I have got 10perc i.e \n17.9+28.9+10.9+11.8 = 69.5rs \nAnd zeptos 5.36 + 1.24 (last transaction) = 6.6rs\n\nBut my question why am I not getting 10perc cashback for last transaction.. It's instamart order only.. \nBut I bought milk? So is it because of that are they any exclusion on the items we buy for cashback \n\n\nPleaseee helppppp!!!

All transactions are on Swiggy. I had two Instamart transaction. The second one seems to be counter for the 1% cashback instead of 10%. The first instamart transaction had a different merchant name though.\nWhat could be the reason for this? I would have understood if the transaction was done near the end of the cycle by that time it would have hit the 1.5K cashback limit.","9":"I have a swiggy hdfc card with my swiggy account for past few months.. \n\nWhen i checked for gold coins in instamart from yesterday night it is showing it as sold out.\n\nJust now i noticed in my sister and wife's swiggy account same gold coins are available.. but they don't have swiggy hdfc card.\n \nAll three account's delivery locations are same.\n\nNot sure why for me it is showing it as sold out.","10":"While doing payment of any Swiggy order, a message is shown how much cashback i will get.   \nThere is no such message while doing the payment for Instamart.   \nHas anyone confirmed if they are receiving cashback on instamart orders as well or not?","11":"","12":"Hi \ud83d\udc4b,\n\nI have seen today that there is an excellent offer on 24kt gold coin on Swiggy instamart -Dhanteras offer on HDFC Swiggy wherein we are able to get an already discounted gold coin at a net effective price of 7389 per coin (after cashback) which is a great price. But can see two challenges one the cashback limit for the card is 1500 so how come it shows 1642. Secondly the 10% cashback is not applicable on jewellery purchase as mentioned in the exclusion. So is it just a mistake from Swiggy side or possible to go through ???","13":"When I use Swiggy for food\/ dineout I see the \u201cextra cashback\u201d option pop up (picture 1) when I pay with CC but it\u2019s NOT giving me that on Instamart (picture 2). Has anyone else faced this? Does it still credit the cashback? \n\nThis is my first month with the card, so will have to wait for the statement in any case.","14":"FYI folks:  \nSaw a post a week ago by someone where an Axis nodal officer clarified that Instamart spends will be eligible.

HDFC Swiggy (LTF) \u2014 For Swiggy, Instamart, and Dineout spends.\n\n3. Axis Ace (FYF then \u20b9590\/year) \u2014 Primarily for offline and utility payments. My monthly utility bills are around \u20b912-15k, so this card is perfect. (Skipped the Airtel card since we don\u2019t use their services.)\n\n4. SBI Cashback (\u20b91180\/year) \u2014 This one will handle all my online transactions.\n\nThanks for the wake-up call, r\/CreditCardsIndia \u2014 you all motivated me to step up my game faster than I thought possible. Now, I\u2019d love to hear any pro tips to maximize the benefits of these cards!\n\n*PS: ICICI Amazon Pay and HDFC Swiggy cards are in my girlfriend\u2019s name.*\n\nLink to my previous post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CreditCardsIndia\/comments\/1gr1rae\/finally_the_beast_is_approved\/","18":"Just opened the Swiggy app to check if I am offered the HDFC Swiggy LTF, but got greeted with an immediately useful offer! \n\nThought you guys would also appreciate 4 months of Swiggy One membership being offered at just 10 rupees cuz it's Swiggy's Birthday. \n","19":"Prioritising my card usage ","20":"Monthly spends on Swiggy is 1.5-2k, Cibil score 784 and yet stuck with this.

I was approved for the card in July, but since then, I haven\u2019t received the correct cashback based on the card\u2019s cashback policy. I\u2019ve raised the issue multiple times, but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nFirst Month: I spent about \u20b92,500 on Swiggy but only received \u20b9140 in cashback(not yet credited in account).As per the 10% cashback policy, I should have received at least \u20b9200.\n\nSeptember Statement: I earned \u20b9420 in cashback(not yet credited in account)but based on my calculations, I should have received \u20b9640.\n\nSwiggy Transactions Issue: Some Swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as Instamart orders, which likely use a different MCC (Merchant Category Code). Because of this, I\u2019m not getting the right cashback, which is unfair. It seems like a Swiggy issue, but I\u2019m the one being penalized.\n\nMoreover, since I got the card, I haven\u2019t received a single rupee cashback in my statement! I\u2019ve emailed Axis twice about this, and here\u2019s what they replied:\n\n \"We would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldn't be shared since there is category-wise capping. We don't have the function to send the breakup of cashback. Cashbacks are system-generated, and hence, a breakup is not available. Please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less.\nWe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the Swiggy App for Food Delivery and Dineout. If you make a transaction on Instamart, Genie, etc., you will not be eligible for cashback.\"\n\nIt feels like I\u2019m being tossed around here, and I don\u2019t know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else. I\u2019m wondering if I can escalate this issue to the RBI Ombudsman, at least regarding the cashback credit issue. Has anyone gone this route before, or can someone guide me on how to proceed?","33":"Got this card LTF and I wanted to know does this card gives cashback on payment like utilities payment through Amazon app. Also while ordering from swiggy before payment on food section is shows me how much cashback i can earn whereas in instamart it doesn't. \nDoes this mean I am not eligible for instamart cashback or is it just a Bug?","34":"I have been eyeing on Swiggy HDFC card for sometime as I use Swiggy massively and many a times I exhaust other card offers on Swiggy within 15-20 days of the month.\n\nThe card was being offered to me as FYF for a month or so but I kept checking and hit \"Apply Now\". I was just going through this sub and found few recent comments about HDFC-Swiggy being offered to some of the fellow reddittors as LTF this week.\n\nI just fire up Swiggy app and there you go - I was welcomed by 2 surprises:\n1. Swiggy extended my membership by 1 month\n2.

I visited the branch and requested them and was given this card. It has pathetic rewards, but I got MMT Black Membership with this card and It helped me save some money. Mostly i use this for bank offers at various websites and for lounge access. It has only first year fee (2499 + taxes) and is LTF from second year.\n2. **ICICI Amzon Pay-** Got after 3 months after getting ICICI MMT. Was instantly approved. Good for using on Amazon and considering it is life time free.\n3. **Axis Flipkart-** Good card as it gives 1.5% cashback on all offline transactions and 5% on Flipkart and Myntra. Now Myntra cashback is reduced but still decent for flipkart and offline. Fee-(500+taxes)\n4. **BOB Premier-** I applied for Eterna but they gave me Premier. I got it LTF. It is useless card for me but after UPI linkage I am able to use is somewhat. i found that BOB customer care is pathetic and also the points are not credited on the accelerated categories.\n5. **CITI Bank Rewards Card**\\- This card I got as first year free and considering it has only spend milestone of 30k per year it can be considered kind of LTF. This card has been really rewarding for me despite its poor reward structure. I got 5k joining voucher from amazon with this card during promotional offer last year. I used it mainly for its accelerated category like shopping, retail. Accelerated rewards also work on Bigbasket, Swiggy Instamart and Big local kirana store. Also I always got more bonus points with this card every month even though I didn't spend much. It allows us to get 1k amazon voucher for 3300 points without any redemption fee and it also works great in malls and stores for shopping offline and roughly gives a reward rate of 2.7%. Also I was able to use this card on many sales on MMT, Cleartrip etc for discount.\n6. **IDFC Wealth Credit Card-** I opened new account with IDFC  last year and maintained 10L plus bank balance for more than 10 months due to personal use reasons. Basis this consideration  I was offered this card. It is awesome for its 1 + 1 movie ticket offer on Paytm upto 500 rs. Apart from that I used this for foreign transactions as it only has a forex markup fee of 1.5% and it offers 2.5% flat reward rate post 30k\/month transactions. The reward rate below 30k is poor, but I use mainly for movie offer and considering its lifetime free, its a good card. Also it is great for lounge access.\n7. **SBI cashback-** I got this card when it was launched as I thought it would be my go to card for online transactions. But it has been heavily devalued. Still good for online shopping but the list of exemptions is increasing day by day.\n8. **HDFC Moneyback+**\\- I wanted a cheap HDFC card for using during sales, so I got this, it gives 10x rewards on Reliance Smart where I shop often so I get good return value. Also it has only spend milestone of 50k\/year which can be achieved easily.\n9. **SBI Prime-** (Closed)Got it during initial days was scammed by the agent. He told me it was lifetime free but it was not. I was able to break even the value somehow and then closed it. \n10. **AMEX MRCC-** (Closed) Wasn't able to use this much so closed it within 2 months of use, It has low acceptability offline.\n\nSpend Recommendations with cards:\n\n1. I use CITI Card on Swiggy Instamart as it gives 125Rs discount on orders above 750.\n2. I buy swiggy vouchers from Axis grabdeals using axis flipkart card (7% off +5% cashback) or from amazon using SBI cash back card(8% off+5% cashback). I load swiggy monthly with 5000Rs voucher, from either source and save upto 12-13% on swiggy food orders.\n3. For travel I use MMT site and cleartrip and have found the best value there. Usually I set price aleart on Skyscanner and wait for price drop and buy using any of the cards basis the day. MMT offers card coupons basis days like ICICI on monday, AXIS on Wednesday, SBI on Thursday etc Just read the offer page before you book. I always compare prices on skyscanner and buy which ever is cheaper.\n4. Nowadays, whenever I go to mall and shop at Pantaloons, Westside etc after I have got the stuff, I quickly check for vouchers on amazon and grabdeals while waiting in the billing line and buy the voucher basis my cart value and save upto 12-15% on the purchase.\n5. I use eazydiner for eating out and book the restaurants that support payeasy and pay using the relevant card offer applicable and save some money there also.\n6. On uber, I use my SBI cashback card as well as for all relevant online shopping, where no other card gives good discount and get 5% cashback.\n7. I pay utility bills using amazon pay card as it gives 2% on utility. Using other cards is always a catch as most cards are exempting utility and are also not giving points on amazon pay gift card and now amazon pay balance has become equivalent to real money.\n8. Train booking can be done on amazon pay if you're able to buy amazon vouchers from somewhere at 5% cashback. \n9. I use paytm to pay my credit card bills and get cashback points, which I can use to buy some vouchers. \n10. I have cred installed and have added my cards there, I use it just to check offers on cards under offers section.\n\nGeneral Tips for emerging credit card users:\n\n1. Not necessary to run after super premium cards, you can get decent value back with cheap cards also which are either lifetime free or have small fee. Understand the strength and weakness of each card and use it to its full potential.\n2. Try to get LTF cards wherever possible and always pay the fees on time.\n3. Always have a SBI, ICICI and HDFC card as most online sale offers are on these cards,\n4. Keep 1 decent card for lounge access which offers atleast 2 lounge access\/quarter.\n5. Use rupay cards with UPI and you can pay even basis needs on credit cards like local kirana stores etc. They don't give points but you are also able to utilize credit for your daily needs.\n6. SBI and BOB have pathetic customer care, ICICI makes us wait too long during calls, IDFC has been good so far, have not needed to contact Axis, CITI and HDFC till now so don't klnow about that.\n\nThere is a scope for optimizing my usage even more but I shared what I currently do. I am always learning and adapting my usage. I encourage others also to share similar tips and offers in the subreddit.\n\nHope this is helpful to all.","43":"Seems like HDFC is handing out LTF Swiggy credit cards to everyone now. \nGot scratch cards in Swiggy order.\n","44":"It has been a month since I started using LTF Swiggy HDFC credit card. It's my first credit card and I applied for it just after I started my first job. The bank agent came to my residence for in person KYC but I was at office and after a few days it was approved nevertheless without any income proof. I got a credit limit of 35k.\n\nAfter using for a month, I got an average of 8% cashback on my total spends which seems pretty good to me. 10% on food, instamart and dineout is pretty amazing! And 5% on amazon, flipkart, myntra, uber, ola, netflix - almost all the necessary and popular platforms! It also seems to offer 5% cb on flight and hotel bookings from HDFC Smartbuy (haven't tried it yet). Plus it's a Mastercard World card!\n","45":"**TL;DR (though I insist, pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a): The Flipkart Axis card, despite its bad reputation, offers significant benefits for frequent Flipkart  shoppers, including  beyond 5% cashback and additional perks. Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S. Don't judge me as some marketing agent of Flipkart or Axis. I'm an ardent member of this sub, always looking for those tips and hacks. Also, I'm not against SBI CB, HDFC swiggy or millenia, I too have SBI CB, it's a beast that I happily use for other purposes. It's just that I haven't closed my FK Axis rn, bearing that \u20b9590 annually \ud83d\ude05, cuz who knows. And Axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past. If you can use and keep it all, better. But, always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robo-thinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber.","46":"Initially it was paid\n\nThen for the longest time, probably 2-3 months, it was FYF\n\nI used to open Swiggy daily and check the status.

Then, this month I am noticing that they have added a 2.5% processing fee for Amazon shopping vouchers which was not there till last month. This effectively reduces the actual benefit derived from the reward points for an Amazon voucher. For example, previously buying 10000\/- worth voucher would give you 1650 points giving value of 10k in voucher and 1650 to be redeemed but now, you have to pay 10290\/- to get the same thing effectively still only giving you a value of 10k as a voucher and 1650 as points but 290\/- has been taken from you from the sum total in the beginning it self. This example is for Amazon vouchers where they are now charging 2.5% as processing fee and forAmazon gift card , the processing fee is 3% (i think processing fee was always there for gift card)\nFor Swiggy\/Instamart there seems to be no monthly limit or processing fee as of yet, same goes for Blinkit.\n\nAny other such sneaky moves, that you are noticing for this supposedly premium card?","58":"This is my (20M) collection. all of the above cards are mine and none of them is an add-on card (exempt mrcc).

Just sharing with the community to check, they might have got it as well.","76":"After many years, I decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet. I've used various cards in the past, including HSBC, HDFC, and Amex, but I canceled most of them around 2019, keeping only one HDFC and Citibank card for increased financial discipline. My main card is the HDFC Regalia Gold. As an Imperia customer, I purposely keep the credit limit 'limited' and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f. The Citi card moved to Axis, which I use as my 'beat-up card' in places where I'm not comfortable using the premium card, keeping its limit below 1L. So, just these 2 cards and all the points go to Regalia gold and use in Smartbuy for all my guilt spends, flights etc\n\nRecently noticed that, I need an ICICI card, SBI card as these are preferred by many e-comm sites for discounts.\n\n**My Details:**\n\n* **Credit Score:**\u00a0835 (Experian), 844 (CRIF) as per CRED\n* **Current Credit Cards:**\u00a0HDFC Regalia Gold, Axis Rupay (UPI enabled)\n* **Annual ITR (last 3 years):**\u00a0Avg INR 80L+\n\n**SBI Cashback Card:**\u00a0(Got *Rejected!*)\n\nBeing an SBI customer for over two decades with a Platinum profile, I saw a 'pre-approved' credit card offer on the online SBI site. After logging in, I completed the online application and KYC using Digilocker data. Despite receiving an email from Aadhar confirming successful KYC, the SBI card site didn't respond. The next day, an SBI card agent called, and someone came to my address for KYC. After filling out a paper form and taking my picture, the KYC was done. However, my application was later rejected. Being in the top 0.1% of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by SBI\u2014guess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club! Now I understand the grin on MS Dhoni's face when he says  \"Jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\"\ud83d\ude06\n\n**HDFC Swiggy Card:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nI applied for this card through HDFC net banking. The online KYC process was smooth, with no physical verification needed. I received the HDFC Swiggy Cashback card in 3-4 days. Since we order a lot on Swiggy, Instamart, and Zomato, this card will replace my other cards for online transactions.\n\n**ICICI HPCL Super Saver:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nWith no prior relationship with ICICI, I applied for this card directly on their site. I chose this card because I spend around 6-7K monthly on HPCL fuel. ICICI cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to HDFC. The application process was smooth, with an option for Video KYC. Despite some initial issues with browser compatibility, the KYC was completed successfully using Google Chrome. The application was approved the next day, and I received the card in 3 days. I promptly disabled Chrome afterward!\n\n**Learnings**:\n\n1. **Digital Efficiency**: HDFC stands out for its smooth, fully online process, setting a benchmark for digital efficiency.\n2. **Customer Experience**: ICICI's process was also efficient, though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues. Their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3. **Service Gaps**: SBI needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses, the overall experience has been enlightening. It's clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customer-centric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process.","77":"Got the Swiggy HDFC CC LTF on the app so I applied.

For many of us, AmazonPay ICICI gets rejected upon application. \n\nThere is one way where you will most probably be successful in getting the card:\n\n- *Get any card from ICICI* :\nI had HPCL Super Saver that I got from college, but you can try getting either Sapphiro LTF through Alumni Offer, if you are a graduate from a top university, or otherwise get a basic ICICI Platinum Credit Card)\n- Now, go to Amazon app. Make sure your Amazon account has the same phone number as your ICICI account\/credit card, and have a decent shopping history on Amazon through that account. Email ID can be different, it's okay. Being a Prime Member is an advantage.\n- Activate AmazonPay Wallet with Full KYC, so that you have good limit. (This will also ensure that you actually get your cashback in this wallet every month)\n- Now, Wait for 3-6 months, keep checking your iMobile Pay app every month. \n- Mostly, you will get an offer to generate a Lifetime Free Coral RuPay Card. This means you have a significant banking history with ICICI Bank, such that the bank is ready to give you more cards on a shared limit. \n- Now, go to Amazon and Apply for the Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card \n- Once it asks you for OTP on SMS, if it asks you to enter your existing ICICI card's last 4 digits, _et viola_, you're in! \n- Give them the basic details (they won't ask you anything much, no kyc, no salary details, nothing, as the bank got it all from you when you applied for the first card)\n- Your AmazonPay ICICI Credit Card will get generated in the next hour, and you can get it delivered in post within a week depending on your location and the speed of Blue Dart.\n- This didn't create a cibil enquiry as this newly generated card will share your existing limit!\n- Might as well generate the Coral RuPay card later if you don't have an LTF RuPay card and your usage is minimal... \n\nDo note, the issuance of AmazonPay ICICI card also depends on Pincode and other factors, but this is the easiest way to get this card.\n\nHowever, even after all this, you don't get this card, there are alternative cards, that ofcourse restrict the cashback categories and the amount monthly. \n\n1) SBI Cashback (999+GST) - 5% upto 5k every month on almost all online websites. \n2) HDFC Millenia (999+GST) - 5% upto 1k every month on top websites & apps, 5% upto 1k every month on SmartBuy, 1% on all purchases upto 1k every month. \n3) HDFC Swiggy (499+GST) - 10% upto 1500 on all swiggy transactions (incl. instamart), 5% upto 1500 on top website\/apps, and 1% upto 500 on all other spends, but the cashback is in form of Swiggy Money ","91":"I have spent more than 9k on swiggy online delivery, instamart, dineout, Zomato.

I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback?

Using them as loan service is not what i am looking for. My purpose is to find cards that can give cashback or similar rewards.\n\nHere's more about me-\n\n- 25M, earning 17LPA. My salary account is with canara bank simply because it's at walking distance from my house. Will I lose out on much by not switching it to a different bank?\n\n- Not a big spender at all, i live with parents and save majority of my money. My monthly expenses are about 15-20k unless I buy some expensive piece of tech or some computer parts\n\n- The above mentioned gadgets and tech stuff is usually bought from third party local vendors who know their products and customers. Basically I don't order much from Amazon, it's just stuff like hair trimmer, rechargable batteries etc. I'd say monthly i spend about 2k or less on Amazon so not sure if their card would make much sense for me. My dad orders on the behalf of his office friends so he has an active account on both Amazon and Flipkart but unfortunately he said no for either of their credit cards.\n\n- I buy expensive stuff like ANC headphones or high end phone from Croma, offline. Planning to buy a mirrorless camera from their store in future.\n\n- Not a traveller but I am planning to go on international trips once my friend gets settled properly. Domestic trips are extremely rare for me. Not exactly dying for lounge access but it'd be nice to have it ig?\n\n- I mostly use Swiggy, for both instamart and food deliveries. Recently tried Dineout and it seemed fine too. I'd say I spend around 6-7k monthly on Swiggy only. This made me consider getting the Swiggy HDFC card cause it showed there won't be any extra charges, basically what people here call LTF. Reason why I didn't get it yet is people here don't recommend getting a co branded card first. \n\n- I don't go out to to eat in restaraunts often, I'd say about once in 2 months.\n\n- Not really interested in buying stuff on EMI but i won't mind no cost EMI if there are additional discounts. (i don't know if that is the case generally or if the additional discounts are what give it the meaning \"no cost\")\n\n- I don't travel much within Delhi either. i do use Uber on occasions. My work is mostly WFH and even if i have to go to the office, we have transport provided by the office.\n\n- I am very sketchy of credit cards in general as they basically let you spend money that you don't have. Which means if it gets lost of stolen, someone can put me in massive debt. I also see posts of people finding out about loans against there account that they didn't apply for. idk how it happens but i'd definitely like to make sure my information is safe and i don't fall prey to such things.\n\n- I am not loyal to a brand like Apple or Samsung. I don't have any eco system and neither am i aiming to build one.\n\n- Don't have a car yet. Might own one in the future but again my fuel expenses won't be a lot.\n\n- Don't have any loans or pending EMI.\n\n- Don't have any netflix, prime or similar subscriptions. I rarely buy PC games. Mostly sail the high seas.\n\n- I occasionally buy clothes from HnM, Uniqlo and Myntraa.\n\n- My mother is really into buying gold stuff but I doubt if there's anything for that?\n\n- I personally don't use Airtel but my parents have a sim card each. They also use Airtel DTH. I read about Airtel Axis card so i can consider getting it and paying for my parent's bills.\n\n- I don't have experience of dealing with banks and stuff. as of now, i don't even know how to get a credit card. Is it just an online process? Do I need to visit bank? Do i need to call bank? I'd prefer to avoid frequent bank visits and getting on calls.\n\n- I don't know much about credit score, or limit and all that stuff.\n\nIn the end, i only want to use credit cards like my debit card while optimizing cashback rewards. Swiggy HDFC card showed that i'd get about 7-8k cashback per year based on how much i spend on swiggy monthly and that's pretty much what made me consider having one and get to know more about this rabit hole.\n\nI'd be really grateful for good recommendations.","139":"Received an SMS from HDFC Bank stating that I've a LTF offer for Swiggy Credit Card but when I click on the link, it opens the Swiggy app which shows FYF only.\nHow to confirm this?","140":"","141":"What should I do ","142":"Hello everyone\r\n\r\nThese are the credit cards I own and how I spent them.

I preferably wanted the Millennia, but it isn\u2019t among the three variants on offer. \n\nBut what\u2019s even weird is that I got an offer for HDFC Swiggy LTF, when I already have it. And almost a year ago, when I got it, it wasn\u2019t being given LTF, so mine is the paid version. \n\nCan I get it? Is that possible to get the LTF one and then deactivate the older one?

For anyone who's applied and gotten it, any tips would be appreciated. (Ques: do I have to be eligible salary-wise as well? What supporting documents do they require?)\n\nI make 1 or 2 trips a year to my hometown, so I was eyeing an airline card too (maybe the Vistara ones, premium economy\/business class tickets do sound very tempting).\n\nI also don't like the idea of paying joining or annual fees. I would like to avoid that as much as possible. I know getting a fyf (subsequently, a waiver after spends) or a ltf card may prove to be difficult but I am looking for suggestions that may eventually offer the possibility at the very least.\n\nApart from this, I think HDFC Swiggy may be a good option. Sorry if this feels all over the place, at the end of the day I just want to maximise the value I can get from my expenses, in any way cashback, points etc. Any and all inputs will be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, I already bank with ICICI and HDFC if that's of any consideration. \n\nThank you for your time.","211":"Hi,  \nI have been planning to buy a scooty.

","214":"Hello fellow redditors, this is gonna be a long post. Its more like a guide for all the new cc users or who are confused between cashback cards or semi-premium card which offers reward points. Do share your opinions on it.\n\nIn this post I'll calculate the cashback\/rps one can earn basis on their spends and help you decide what is better for you. A cashback card or semi\/premium card. The cards which I will consider are Airtel Axis, ICICI Apay, Amex Plat Travel and HDFC Regalia Gold. As Airtel Axis is sometimes hard to get a good alternative will be SBI CB.\n\nMy calculations will on the basis of my yearly spends and rounding them off to 4L because waiver and milestone for both Regalia Gold and Plat Travel is at 4L. Considering the spends for which vouchers are available I'll take those in consideration.\n\n* Airtel Axis (Direct Spends - no vouchers)\/SBI CB (Park + \/ Magicpin)\n* ICICI Apay (Direct Spends - no vouchers)\n* HDFC Regalia (Smartbuy)\n* Amex Plat Travel (Amex Multiplier)\n\n**Yearly Spends considered :**\n\n* Swiggy (Instamart) - 30k\n* Utilities (Electricity\/Gas Bills) - 30k\n* Mobile recharge - 12k\n* Health Insurance - 55k\n* Other spends (rounding off to 4L) - 273k\n\n*Pairing Airtel Axis and ICICI Apay for the spends one can earn around 11k in form of cashback. (Swiggy\/Utilities\/Mobile Recharge on Airtel Axis and rest health insurance at 2% and other spends on ICICI Apay).*\n\n*Making this spends on Regalia Gold one can earn around 14800 reward points. (Swiggy\/Amazon vouchers for utilities and insurance on smartbuy and remaining points at base reward rate of 2.66%)*\n\n*Making the spends on Plat Travel one can earn 53000 reward points - including milestones. (Swiggy\/Amazon vouchers for utilities and insurance on Amex Plat Travel and remaining points earned at base reward rate of 2%)*\n\n\n\nThis are my yearly spends and based on my assumptions. I've not included travelling spends because I don't travel much and have considered them in other spends. And any other bonus offers which might be offered through the year.\n\nThe cashback value can be improved further by using SBI CB and Park + and Magic Pin.\n\n***CB is plain CB, HDFC reward points for flights and hotels and Plat Travel best for Marriott stays. I'm in no way promoting any particular card. This is just my view which might help you in selecting you card. And as your spends climb higher (then the spends most probably are travel spends) reward cards make the best value.***\n\n*So after evaluation one can consider the potential cashback value as pivot for deciding between the cashback card or a RP card. Also considering that semi\/premium card will come with host of benefits like lounge access\/meet & greet\/conceirge\/golf and other benefits and how you value them.*\n\n**Either you spend less and earn more with a CB card. Or spend more and enjoy lifestyle benefits on reward cards.**","215":"Went with the new buzz on this community & Applied for Swiggy hdfc card, got it in two days.

Any thoughts on this ? Is it a good deal?\nKind of a credit card newbie here","487":"Hey everyone, looking for a new card in addition to my existing ICICI Apay & Airtel Axis cards. Mostly looking for a card that gives some discounts on online shopping like Flipkart, Myntra, Uber, Ola, Instamart, BB etc. I don't spend much on these, maybe 2-3k combined per month. I also do spend a little offline on groceries in DMart. I have searched & have finalized these 2, but I am up for suggestions about other cards as well. I don't mind paying an annual fees upto 500 Rs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. HDFC Swiggy\n\n\\- I don't use Swiggy takeout much, maybe once or twice a month. But Instamart I use almost weeky around 200 rs per order. Considering it credits cashback as Swiggy vouchers, I can use it to order from instamart. It also gives 5% cashback on platforms like Flipkart, Myntra & Uber which means I can also use it there to get cashback. Joining fees of 500, but they are offering Swiggy One for 3 months as well as a 1,500 rs voucher (not sure of what but it says in the HDFC website), so its almost 3 years free. Though I have heard about 5% cashback not being deposited for some online platforms, so that's a concern (not sure though).\n\n2.  Myntra Kotak\n\n\\- I know its not a very loved card, but 7.5% instant discount (& 7.5% on sales) on Myntra seems pretty good. I don't shop much maybe once or twice every 2 months around 1-2k rs. Assuming an average of 1500 every 2 months, I will get around 562.2 rs as discount considering its annual fees of 500 rs  + GST, but they are also offering a 1000 rs Myntra voucher on joining so its basically two years free. They also have 5% cashback on Swiggy & Instamart, but airtel axis also has the same or more. BUT they have a Rupay variant & give 1.25% cashback on all other spends, so I can use Rupay on UPI in DMart & restaurants and else where as well & they're also giving 1 Domestic lounge access every quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS - I know the SBI Cashback card is pretty solid & gives 5% everywhere but I dont think my spending will be enough to recover the fees. I am looking for a card that complements my existing ways of spending, rather than something that will force me to spend just to recover fees or get benefits. Again, I am open to other card suggestions as well. I also have an existing Millenia DC (ik its not a credit card, but it does offer some cashbacks on gift vouchers & stuff).

I use CC for only bar\/club expenses, big orders such as gadgets from Amazon and bulk orders from Swiggy Instamart.\n\nMy CIBIL Score is 764. I have never missed a payment. I had also taken an IDFC EMI for a smartwatch with 6-month instalments which is complete now.\n\nNow I have been planning to get some gadgets online which cost me 70-90k per purchase and I am planning to make those purchases over the next 12 months. Of course, I can save that amount and then buy them, but I really don't want to do that because it's a waste of time. Also, it's a hassle to even find the right specs gadgets in showrooms with financing facilities.

I want HDFC Millenia, but their website UI is only letting me pick between Moneyback+, Indian Oil, and Tata Neu. I will try to go to the bank physically and see what happens.

When I place an instamart order, the app takes me to the bank otp screen, an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited. Even order history shows nothing, naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed, lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same. This has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if it's a tactic to inflate revenue\/sales.\n\nThe first time it happened I ignore it as an oversight on my part. \n\nThe second time, after 2 different drivers gave me the same items I contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldn't have accepted the items now we cant do anything.\n\nThe 3rd time (today) the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times. This time I made the drivers wait till I got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted Mr that if I raise a chat ticket, they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money. So, I let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said \" Sorry sir you accepted the order so now I can't give you any refund\". I am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that I was falling in the same situation. I have written an email to instamart support but I really think I'm done with this app.\n\nAttaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is.\n\nWonder if anyone else has gone through this.","1205":"Three days ago, I ordered a swimming short for \u20b91700, which I know is quite expensive. I had joined Cult Fit for swimming lessons, and the instructor informed me that as long as I had swim shorts, I could get into the water. However, when the order arrived, I received a size XL instead of the 2XL I had ordered. The product is completely untouched and unused.\n\nI reached out to Swiggy for help, asking them to look into the mistake and resolve the issue, but they responded by saying nothing could be done. Frustrated, I have now raised a grievance with the National Consumer Helpline. I am considering filing an FIR under IPC sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust).\n\n\nDo you think i am kinda overreacting and let it go just like every other indian and kind of advice is appreciated \n\nEdit 1 : I went to the police station, and they informed me to return tomorrow at 10 a.m. when the Detective Inspector will be available to handle such cases. They also mentioned that I could file a complaint online if necessary, but I am required to appear in person when requested.","1206":"Just paid 100 for these eggs and arrived broken, is there an option to put these into swiggys ass?","1207":"So today I ordered some stuff from instamart and one item was missing from my order.\n\nI complained on swiggy as soon as I saw what was missing. They said they will provide solution after 6 hours.\n\nAfter 6 hours also they did nothing and when i kept pestering them they said that compensation can't be provided coz my claims are not valid.\n\nI was really frustrated coz of the lack of proper response from them so I filed a complaint on consumer forum. I attached payment screenshot with it.\n\nAfrer a while swiggy mailed me to say that they will provide a coupon for the same amount that will be valid for a month. I wanted the item delivered or my money refunded. But I still asked them to proceed.\n\nNow what should i do? Will my complaint be taken seriously? Or can i withdraw it?\n\nWhat will happen to the complaint i filed?\n","1208":"i would like biriyani from one place and dessert from one place without having to pay extra for delivery \ud83d\ude05\n\n","1209":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wtk1e12v8f4e1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=121823ed1ddea943b2c870edb9fdecc12333a519\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/86s48ijv8f4e1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4892d19f750a7b6704e9223b6939d708d25842aa\n\nHas anyone else had issues with Swiggy and their HDFC card auto-filling OTPs? I just got scammed twice in a row! Both times, orders were placed without my consent because the OTP auto-filled.\n\nI didn't even realize anything was happening until I got two different delivery persons showing up at my door with two separate orders.\n\nI called swiggy when it happened first time they didn't help saying it won't happen in future.\n\nAgain it happened yesterday still their customer support executive and senior executive provided no help at all.\n\nHere's how it happened:  \nI added products to cart and went to payments screen:  \nSelected Swiggy HDFC Credit card and clicked continue to payment  \nOn HDFC bank's OTP screen, I manually entered OTP and clicked on submit  \nInstead of taking me back to order confirmation page, the page itself refreshed and another OTP CAME making me think that maybe I mistyped OTP  \nThis time the app auto filled the OTP and took me to order confirmation page  \nThen few minutes later there were two different delivery persons with same items who already marked order as delivered before me coming out of the door\n\nCalled their customer support which was totally of no help and wasted a lot of my time","1210":"Hello community.

By the time I reached, I knew most shops would probably be closed. I\u2019m someone who likes to plan ahead to avoid last-minute stress, so I wanted to have everything sorted before leaving. That\u2019s why I placed the order from my office.\n\nDid the receptionist actually see it?\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. As soon as I told the delivery guy to leave the package at the reception desk, I went there to pick it up. But being an overthinker, I just assumed the worst. Also, I posted about it on Reddit as a joke, and it blew up way more than I expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the real issue here?\nThe real issue isn\u2019t whether it was a condom or something else. The question is, why does anyone have to see my personal stuff at all? Whether it\u2019s a condom, a carrot, or anything else, my privacy should be respected. Imagine living in a flat where non-veg food isn\u2019t allowed. What if your landlord sees the delivery guy handing you mutton? Or imagine a girl living in a hostel and the guard sees her receiving an emergency contraceptive pill.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about condoms or carrots. It\u2019s about why anyone needs to see what I\u2019m ordering. This isn\u2019t a debate about things like black polythene bags for sanitary pads. It\u2019s simply about respecting privacy in general.\n\nAnyway, thank you all for the attention and take care!

You don\u2019t need to worry about missing ingredients or complex steps\u2014just unpack, follow the recipe card included, and cook up a delicious meal. We\u2019re building a menu that offers a variety of dishes, including ones that people don\u2019t typically make at home, so our customers can explore new flavors and meals without the hassle of sourcing ingredients.\n\nWhy Choose Our Service Over Quick Commerce?\n\nWe\u2019re not competing with services like Blinkit, Instamart, or Zepto. Our goal is to enhance the cooking experience by providing all ingredients in the right amounts and cuts\u2014perfect for anyone who loves food but finds cooking intimidating or time-consuming. Plus, we include ingredients that aren\u2019t always easy to find in small quantities (like olives, specific herbs, or international spices), so you don\u2019t have to buy a whole jar just to try out one dish.\n\nExpanding Into Health & Personalized Nutrition\n\nBeyond just meal kits for cravings, we\u2019re working on a specialized range of healthy kits. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re working towards a fitness goal, like weight loss or muscle gain. There are plenty of services that tell you how many calories to consume and burn, but none that offer meal kits tailored to your exact calorie intake and nutritional needs. Our premium service will create kits specifically for these goals, giving our customers the convenience of knowing that each meal fits their plan, without the extra planning or prep work.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWe tested our service in my hometown and saw some solid traction, all without any marketing.

I waited for 5 mins, and saw the minute count got refreshed to 15. Okay. After 7 mins or so, a delivery partner was assigned. A few minutes later, he came, handed me the package, and I carried it inside. As I was opening the package, I felt odd because I had ordered ice cream. But I didn't feel anything cold inside the package. To my surprise there was a black sports t-shirt. I opened the wrapper and saw the logo ADIDAS. Wow.

Even added a tip for the delivery agent. \n\nI had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofa's armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately. Just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where I unpack groceries, I started to faintly smell BLEACH (Harpic). \n\nI was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as I cut open the top of the bag. Delivery agent was gone by then. There was light\/no wetness on items at the top, but the more I got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items. The bleach smell from the Harpic Bleach (white bottles) fumes I had ordered was very strong, even burning my eyes slightly at this point. \n\n\nI took pictures and sent it on Swiggy Instamart chat. There is a pool of bleach at the bottom. There is even a picture where I lifted the bag up and there's so much bleach on the kitchen counter !!! It leaked through the bag\/holes in it!!\nSWIGGY INSTAMART COMPLEYELY REFUSED TO REPLACE\/REFUND\/EXCHANGE ! \n\n\nMy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point. Checked and found that the spot on my sofa's armrest where I put the bag down while taking the delivery was SOAKED in bleach ! I started to panic-clean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that we're not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical. \n\n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\n\nI offered several solutions : \n1. REVERSE PICKUP ALL ITEMS AND GIVE ME A FULL REFUND. Gurmeet Kaur (supervisor) refused. Why ?? \n2. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OK FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL ITEMS AND REPLACE IT WITH A FRESH ORDER. They didn't even want to speak about solutioning this ! \n3. I asked for an exchange\/full refund of all food products atleast, since bleach can literally hospitalize\/kill you ! She REFUSED !! I had sent 5-7 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said I need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it. I told her you can't see wetness on all products unless it's dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help ???  And I had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and we're getting exposed to it. \n4. Even if there's a chance few other items didn't make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach. Bleach FUMES are enough to contaminate any thing. I would not risk mine or anybody's health by allowing them to eat these items. Basic common sense. I had bought snacks for visiting kids today. But she refused to agree there was even a problem here !! \n5. Not only do I have to throw several of the items I ordered cause they are no longer safe, I also have to clean my counter tops, get rid of all exposed items\/bags into sealed clean bags, I also need to clean my sofa !! I don't even know how to remove bleach from a sofa !! Not to mention bleach will discolour clothes\/fabric !! It's a dark coloured sofa ! \n\n\nSwiggy thinks it's safe for their customers to use\/eat products from the same bag as leaking bleach ! They took zero responsibility for wasting my time, effort (ordering, waiting for delivery, talking to them on chat\/call, and CLEANING THE MESS AND HEALTH HAZARD they caused), my WASTED MONEY or for potentially compromising the health of others like this ! Are these their company's quality of service, standards and principles ??\n\n\nNote - I understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery I easily spend about Rs. 14,000-17,000 per month on their app for years now, very rarely raising issues. \n\n\nLessons learned\/For everybody reading this, \n1. Please don't order toxic or harmful substances like Harpic\/bathroom or toilet cleaners, floor cleaners, drain cleaners, naphthalene balls, dishwashing liquids, etc from SWIGGY INSTAMART since they use flimsy, non-leak proof bags, and don't segregate food items from chemical items while delivering. I will only order groceries from BigBasket from now onwards.\n2. Atleast order food items and other things in SEPERATE ORDERS.\n3. Check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since SWIGGY INSTAMART WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN CASE OF COMPROMISED PRODUCTS.\n4. Take pictures, videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system, or for social media. \n\n\nAm I being unreasonable expecting Swiggy to take responsibility here ? It shocks me that they didn't take any actions to correct such a health hazard ! \nPictures attached (zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom)","1865":"It was getting late and that's why I had to order couple of things so I can make myself dinner, So called instamart supposedly deliverys within 30 mins, A nearest trip to grocery store and few other stores would take me around 40 mins, thus decided to order online, Usually order from zepto but instamart was cheaper, This mother fllipin system of soo called instant service took 1 & half hours and fucked my night soo fucking badly, Zepto literally takes 20 mins max, and when I contacted the Swiggy people all they said was woops my bad here have \u20b950 coupon on next Instamart order, not gonna blame the delivery guy cuz they have lots of orders to do, But Swiggy literally gets more than 10-12 orders together it seems, That guy was going everywhere but towards my home and I am soo fucking mad at them, Can't even cancel the order or else I could have gone and got them myself or zeopted them, The system sucks and I am pissed.    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n   \nTLDR\nInstamart took 1\u00bd hours and I am pissed ","1866":"","1867":"","1868":"So today my friend bought 1 or 1.5L coke bottle from Dmart.

Customer account creation will involve all the usual details which all the apps take additionally an aadhar verification and a latest photo of customer which will be used for facial recognition while placing the order. 2.

A delivery partner would be assigned to deliver the order.

Since Suprdaily's shut down I have been using Swiggy's Instamart for milk and groceries delivery.\n\nSuprdaily had a simple, user friendly interface when compared to other apps. Instamart seems to have a monthly subscription model too but every order should be placed individually and be at least of hundred rupees to avoid additional delivery charges. Sometimes all I need is a litre or half a litre of milk and it costs less than hundred. I avoided milk\/food wastage when I used Suprdaily as I could change the next day's delivery quantity based on my need, change the delivery date or put deliveries on hold whenever I didn't need things immediately. Are there any apps like this? Which apps are similar or close enough to Suprdaily's service model? \n\nWhile fast deliveries are good sometimes, I don't want to order every day.

Add to this liquidity has vanished in the market for now. A great example to understand why pre IPO is not an investment class at least for general public. At a high level its because of following reasons\n\n1. Zomato QIO being more attractive due to better floor price\n2. Swiggy being pressurised to undergo another valuation cut to satisfy book runners\n3. Instamart valuations are not in agreement with investor sentiment\n\nGeneral consensus among pre ipo facilitators is that value can drop to 320, at which book runners and qualified buyers can step in.","2574":"As Swiggy gears up to go public, there are some interesting factors for investors to consider. On one hand, Swiggy has established itself as one of India\u2019s top two food delivery players (alongside Zomato), with a strong user base and brand loyalty. Plus, it's been diversifying with offerings like Instamart (quick commerce) and Swiggy Genie (personalized delivery services), tapping into new markets like rapid grocery delivery.\n\nHowever, Swiggy\u2019s DRHP shows persistent losses since inception and negative cash flow, though it has made recent progress in narrowing those losses. The company still relies heavily on discounts and marketing to retain users, which puts pressure on profit margins. There's also increased regulatory scrutiny on gig workers and potential tax liabilities, which could add to its costs and operational complexities in the future. Furthermore, Swiggy faces strong competition from Zomato and new entrants like the government-backed ONDC, which offers food delivery at significantly lower prices. This puts Swiggy under pressure to innovate and retain its user base while managing costs effectively.\n\nThat said, there are still reasons some investors might find Swiggy attractive. India\u2019s online food delivery and quick-commerce markets are still relatively young, and Swiggy has a solid track record of growth and brand recognition. Its quick-commerce arm, Instamart, is growing fast and could potentially become a profitable segment. Swiggy's ability to diversify beyond food delivery could make it a more resilient and versatile company in the long run.\n\nSo, the big question is whether Swiggy can achieve sustainable profitability and capitalize on its brand and market position, or if ongoing competition and operational challenges will weigh down its performance. What do you think? Are the growth prospects worth the risk?\n\n\n\n","2575":"Here are the top 5 key takeaways from Swiggy's upcoming IPO:\n\n1. IPO Details: Swiggy's IPO is open for subscription from November 6 to 8, 2024, with a price range set between \u20b9371 and \u20b9390 per share, targeting to raise around $1.35 billion.\n\n\n2. Valuation: Swiggy is expected to be valued at approximately $11.3 billion, a reduction from its earlier $15 billion valuation, reflecting current market conditions.\n\n\n3. Structure of Offering: The IPO includes a fresh issue of \u20b93,750 crore and an offer-for-sale of 185.3 million shares by existing shareholders, including notable investors like Prosus, Accel, and Tencent.\n\n\n4. Utilization of Funds: The funds raised will largely support Swiggy's expansion in its quick commerce segment, Instamart, including infrastructure enhancements like larger warehouses.\n\n\n5. Investor Interest: Despite a cautious grey market outlook, Swiggy\u2019s IPO has drawn strong interest from institutional investors, including Norges Bank and Fidelity, signaling confidence in the company's long-term growth potential.\n\n\n\n","2576":"Hey everyone! With Swiggy\u2019s IPO hitting the stock market tomorrow, I\u2019m curious to know what you all think will happen with its listing performance. Here are some points being discussed in the market:\n\n1. Valuation Concerns: Some analysts are saying Swiggy might be overvalued compared to its peer, Zomato, given its current financials and recent growth strategy focused on quick commerce. Are we looking at another Paytm-like situation, or will it surprise us?\n\n\n2. Growth Potential vs. High Cash Burn: Swiggy has been aggressive with growth, expanding beyond food delivery into Instamart and other quick commerce areas. But we all know the cash burn rate is steep, which could impact its profitability in the long run. Will this expansion help with a strong listing day, or do you think it could backfire due to sustainability concerns?\n\n\n3. Market Sentiment and IPO Fever: Given the current market conditions, will retail investors flock to it for short-term gains, or are people going to be more cautious, given the volatility of recent tech IPOs?\n\n\n4. Possible Listing Pop or Drop? With the price band set between INR 371-390, do you think it will list at a premium, or could we see it dip on debut day? We\u2019ve seen some IPOs do exceptionally well post-listing, while others have struggled initially before stabilizing.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your gut feeling? Planning to hold or flip if you got an allotment?","2577":"1. Company fundamentals:\n\nSimilar to its competitor Zomato during its IPO in 2021, Swiggy is also recording net losses year after\u00a0year. Although the losses are narrowing down with time, Swiggy faces intense competition in business from Zomato which has captured a lot of market share.\u00a0\n\nSo, Swiggy's path to profitability is filled with challenges, including Zomato catering and leading even in tier-2 and tier-3 districts. Swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its Q-commerce (quick commerce) business to become profitable.\n\n2. Issue size and split\n\nIt is preferable that the fresh\u00a0issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. Swiggy IPO is worth 11,327 crore and about 40% of it is fresh issue shares, which is just about fine to create trust among investors.\n\n3. Brand name and experienced Management\n\nA skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company\u2019s long-term growth. Swiggy is a startup and doesn't have a big conglomerate to propel the business.\n\nHowever, the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate, adapt to market trends, and execute strategies effectively.\n\n5. Valuation\n\nSwiggy's management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front.\n\n6. Clear Use of Proceeds\n\nThe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the IPO, such as for expansion, R&D, or reducing debt.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned earlier\u00a0Swiggy is looking to grow its Q-commerce business.\u00a0So a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the IPO \u2013 Rs 982 crore \u2013 is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of Instamart\u2019s dark store. The remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in Scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same Scootsy segment.\n\n7. Strong underwriting team\n\nUnderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company, scrutinizing its financial statements, business model, management team, and future prospects. This process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities. Therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO can signal credibility and thorough due diligence.\u00a0\n\nThe book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, JPMorgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Jefferies India, ICICI Securities, and Avendus Capital. Most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy.\n\nBut considering the current market sentiments and competition with Zomato, it is almost certain that Swiggy is set to list at a discount. Especially considering that the GMP of the IPO is at Rs. 12 (just a 4% premium).\n\nVerdict: If you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains (although this is far fetched), you can invest according to your risk appetite, keeping in mind that the IPO is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium.","2578":"**Revenue and Profitability:**\u00a0Swiggy has demonstrated strong financials ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The Bengaluru-based firm reported a 33% jump in its revenue to Rs 11,634 crore in FY24 from Rs 8,714 crore in FY23. Swiggy has also managed to reduce its losses by 44% to Rs 2,350 crore in the last fiscal year.\u00a0\n\n**Business Growth:**\u00a0Swiggy said that its food delivery business grew 17% to Rs 6,100 crore while its quick commerce vertical Instamart registered Rs 1,100 crore gross revenue in the last fiscal year. When compared, Zomato's overall revenue in FY24 jumped 71% to Rs 12,114 crore. This includes Rs 6,161 crore from the food business and Rs 2,301 crore via the grocery business, Blinkit. Swiggy was neck and neck with Zomato in terms of food delivery whereas it was behind in terms of grocery business.\n\n**Business Prospects:**\u00a0Swiggy's consumer-facing business comprising food delivery, Instamart, and dining recorded a total gross order value (GOV) of Rs 35,000 crore driven by its 14.3 million monthly transacting users. Continuous improvements in contribution margin across segments is driven by rising take rates and higher contribution of advertisement revenues, cost optimization, and reduction of discounts. Instamart's rapid expansion was on the back of the increased density of dark stores in existing cities and expansion to new cities.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bki5873mybrd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8032a3245de0ddb97e92383805810ea08ea706\n\n","2579":"Zee Business thinks it is good for investment with targets of Rs 250, 300, 400.\n\nZomato share has corrected up to Rs148 this month.

They are doing good generating good revenue and also they are generating employment. But what is not good?\n\nZomato is trading at about 180 TTM PE. It is about 9 times the NIFTY. So if GDP is growing at 8%, to sustain its valuation it need to grow at 30% every year and yes, it is growing!\n\nNow lets read the fineprint - Swiggy is a total wonder, it is still burning cash.\n\n|Particulars|FY22|FY23|FY24|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|\u20b95,704 crore|\u20b98,264 crore|\u20b911,247 crore|\n|Net Loss|\u20b93,628 crore|\u20b94,179 crore|\u20b92,350 crore|\n\nIt looks amazing that loss is reducing and they are about to reach profitability. Having staggering 11,247 crore revenue! The issue is market cap which is crossing 1 Lakh crore. That too on zero profit. Generally loss making companies are valued at 2X revenue, max 4X. But it is whopping 9X revenue multiple!\n\nEven in recent Q2 - it did well 30% YoY growth at loss of 625.5 crore.\n\nBut when you look at QoQ it is a different story.\n\nLoss widened from 611 crore to 625 crore. Revenue rose 11.77% from 3322 to 3601 crore. But fineprint is it came on back of very heavy competitive quick commerce business instamart. Food delivery business grown QoQ at 4%. Which is very concerning. It means food delivery revenue is flattened this quarter.\n\nConsidering 80% weightage to food business in valuation - EBIT of 122 crore, then also it is 250-300 PE higher than Zomato! Zomato profit is five times. They said will take 2 more years to be profitable! Why?\n\nThat's why I keep on saying extremely high PE means very high risk. Again it is not recommendations, it is how you analyze the fine print number, wrapped into big big business reports!","2670":"1.Company fundamentals:\n\nSimilar to its competitor Zomato during its IPO in 2021, Swiggy is also recording net losses year after year. Although the losses are narrowing down with time, Swiggy faces intense competition in business from Zomato which has captured a lot of market share. \n\nSo, Swiggy's path to profitability is filled with challenges, including Zomato catering and leading even in tier-2 and tier-3 districts. Swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its Q-commerce (quick commerce) business to become profitable.\n\nTenfold growth is expected in 2028 for the Qcommerce segment, and the quick growth in the number of dark stores in recent times are the major factors Swiggy would want to use to drive its business growth.\n\n2.

QIB subscription:\n\nWhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company.\n\nQIB subscription had zero subscription on day 1 but the number picked up at the end of day 2 to a marginal 28% of the QIB portion. This means that QIBs are showing only mild interest in the IPO unlike Bajaj Finance which was fully subscribed by QIBs on day 1 itself.\n\nBut considering the current market sentiments and competition with Zomato, it is almost certain that Swiggy is set to list at a discount.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","2731":"I am making app for my college project is it possible to access the swiggy instamart product listing data api calls?","2732":"Hi, are there any apis available  publicly available to use and if not how can I achieve this on my own.","2733":"Hey all,\n\nFor my own personal use, I want to block the food delivery option on the Swiggy app and use Swiggy only for Instamart.

By the time you clear your debt, you are already 26\/27 and you now have to marry, then kids, so no savings at all. Your expenses are only gonna go higher.

I'm working and they gave me only moneyback+ \ud83e\udd79","Some tips for millenia users.\n\n* Cashbacks are calculated for a calendar month, irrespective of the billing date, ie 1-31st of a month. \n\n* Cashback will only counted on the date it appears on the statement. ie, when the transaction is 'billed' by the system, so it may take upto 3 days for it to reflect in the statement. Consider this especially when you try to maximize during 28-31st of the month, as it may get billed in the next month, not optimising both months as a result. \n\n* Try to maximize 5% transactions. That is a only Rs20k\/- per calendar month. Also remember, if that 20k is crossed. You would be getting 0% on these transactions, not 1%. So, optimize wisely. \n\n* Use amazon gift cards\/amazon pay whenever possible. Let's say, you don't have have any purchases this month but have next month. Use this month to buy amazon gift cards\/load up amazon pay. Remember amazon pay max limits are dependent on your kyc with amazonpay. \n\n* Amazon gift cards are valid for 1 year from date of issue. You cannot use amazon gift cards to buy other gift cards such as dominos\/lifestyle\/croma\/mmt etc.","I'm not sure about that.\n\nBut the best way to use Millennia on swiggy is to buy swiggy money vouchers from smartbuy.

Thanks for putting the efforts to write this detailed.\n\nI'd also love to contribute a tons of tips & tricks later, as it's midnight..putting only a few from the top of my mind for now:\n\n* For cc bill payments, you can get straight 1% cb or even more easily instead of paytm points.  Hdfc dc gives 1% upto 75K\/month directly into account, Jupiter does the same with 15k\/month, including mobikwik can give double (2% with either supercoins or cb in wallet) etc. Consider these if you have the resources. Since you already use cred, using 1k trick can also give 1-2% cb upto 12k\/month\n* SBI cashback (visa) can also be used to scan & pay bharatQR codes, which can also give 5% cb ;) Try your luck if haven't already.\n* I'm also a Jio user like you and still recommend airtel axis, if you're eligible you can consider taking it. With its 300 caps, it's easier to max out the 25% category in 1 or 2 recharges (you just need a friend's or relative's Airtel xtream or just sim). Then 10% on utility bills you won't get anywhere else. 40% on swiggy is another bonus.\n* To track cc bill, if you've given cred the access to your primary email, you can simply create\/use a separate email instead & make a filter to fwd only statements there.\n* You can also pay your other credit card bills using rupay cc. Though this an unethical trick & can be patched anytime so won't recommend. Would like to read other's thoughts though.\n\nThere's so much more on optimising spendings, general tips, exploiting bugs etc. Would love to discuss & learn from each other.","why are you still on moneyback btw? just close it and apply c2c using your other cards with highest limit.","Excellent post and from my limited experience i agree with all the points that you have mentioned as i am also using my icici coral, amazon pay and flipkart axis cards the same way(will soon be receiving my hdfc moneyback+ card also).\n\nCan you answer some of my questions?\n1.

I think the powerbank is working fine. If you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left, it is fine.\n20k maH Powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure. Thats all.","Let me see if I can explain this.\nSee what is the voltage of your powerbank. These are normally 3.7 V. So, the total wattage is 3.7 v * 20000 mah = 3.7 V * 20 Ah = 74 Wh.\n\nPhones operate at 5 V. So, a single full charge of the phone need wattage = 5 V * 4500 mAh = 5 V * 4.5 Ah = 22.5 Wh\n\nSo, number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank = 74 \/ 22.5 = 3.28 times. Considering 10-15% wastage, you will be able to charge it around 2.8 times. So, after 2 charges, if it is having some more charge, then I think that the powerbank is fine. You are expecting too much from the powerbank. You can buy another powerbank from Amazon \/ Flipkart, but you will probably get similar results.","What were your expectations though?","It's not a scam, it's working as expected.

At certain times the product delivered  is either beyond expiry or is stale, has mold\/fungus or infested. This happens with both food and instamart orders.\n2. Non veg food is provided even though vegetarian product wad ordered.\n3. Listing issues where non vegetarian food is listed under vegetarian only items.\n4. Delivery issues where the delivery executive picked up the order and then switched off the phone or refuses to deliver the food.\n5. Delivery executive trying to takeover a customer account by initiating OTP for login and once have access to it, they change the phone number and email and then order bulk food and groceries at their preferred location with cash on delivery without paying.(happy to share more information on this as this happened a while back with me and wife).\n6. Under weight items delivered vs promised weight.\n\nEarlier swiggy used to own all such issues and help out customers by either replacing items, banning a restaurant or giving a full refund and used to charge a lot less. Ofcourse they wanted to onboard more customers and hence were helpful.\n\nNow they charge high amount of different fees, surcharge etc. But when you report an issue there responses are:-\n1. Swiggy is only an aggrigator, use Google to put in a negative review.\n2. A user waiting for their food or groceries for few hours and support tells them they cannot cancel the order, if cancelled all charges will be paid by user. This too when delivery executive is not picking calls or refusing to deliver the order.\n3.

I want to list a few less obvious dark patterns:\n\n\n\n**Variable Pricing**: The pricing for Swiggy One and Zomato Gold varies from user to user. The more frequently you order food, the higher the price for you. This is because the platforms are compensating for the loss of profit on delivery charges. Some users even have a negative score, meaning they aren't shown the option to buy Zomato Gold.\n\n\n\n**Limited Options in Bad Weather**: If you buy Swiggy One, you might find yourself at a disadvantage during rainy weather, which is common in Bangalore. When it rains, you'll be shown fewer restaurant options, and many become undeliverable. You can test this yourself the next time it rains. Many restaurants are available for non-Swiggy One users but are not available for Swiggy One users, possibly due to the delivery charge.\n\n\n\n**Increasing Prices at Favorite Restaurants**: The more often you order from your favorite restaurant, the higher the prices become. You'll receive fewer discounts with each order.\n\n\n\n**Packing Charges**: Charging \u20b950 for packing is outrageous; it's robbery.","Delivery distance - I have a post here https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swiggy\/s\/uiF0pMmSLj.","Platform fees.

Customers get attracted to the numbers which look healthy.\nAnd if you can't sell at a bakery you can try selling near the gym or yoga centres if the owner is buying product from you great otherwise you can try to be outside of gym and showcase the benefits of products they will buy.\n\nHope this helps!","Digital marketing would be good","I\u2019d suggest you stick to Amazon . \nIndia is a trust deficit society  and people trust buying from Amazon more than independent sites . \n\nAnd focus on building a social media presence and brand first . \nFirst focus on why someone would buy your product and once that is strongly established . \nWork on your usp , and see which category it is in , is it a premium product .\nIs it one of those organic , less sugar or transfat products .\nPlay on that .\nIf you crack the taste and texture and it feels like value for money , \nPeople \u2018d pay for that .\n\nYou can learn how to run ads and direct customers to Amazon . \n\nAlso see if you can work with quick delivery apps like Blinkit,Zepto , instamart .\n\nChocolates are in the wants category and people usually buy it to gift or as an impulsive spend , \nAnd quick delivery apps make it more convenient.\n\nOnce you reach a certain amount of sales , the category managers at Amazon will give you the time and guidance .","So, here\u2019s what\u2019s standing out to me - your products are clearly good (repeat customers and good reviews prove that), but it feels like you\u2019re stuck in the classic \u201cgreat product, low visibility\u201d loop. \n\nLet Amazon do more work for you. Try tweaking your product titles and descriptions with keywords people actually search for. In that price segment, gifting seems to be the only fitting category, else shift yourself to Fresh. Doing this is free, just time-consuming, but it can help your products show up higher in relevant search results.\n\nIf you can spare a bit of cash, Amazon ads might be worth a shot but tiny, hyper-focused budgets only. Target just a few keywords that match your niche, monitor them weekly, and pause anything that\u2019s wasting money. It\u2019s not a magic bullet, but it might push some extra sales your way.\n\nD2C definitely isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s doable. Instagram could be your discovery platform. Lean into reels showing how you make your chocolates or chips. People love that \u201cmade with care\u201d vibe. See what competing brands are doing, what\u2019s working for them. Partner with micro-influencers in the foodie\/health niche who\u2019ll work for free samples or a barter deal. Also, get a basic free Shopify store or even just an Instagram shop going so customers can buy directly from you (less platform fees).\n\nFor B2B, approach local cafes or gourmet stores. Your margins look decent, so offer them bulk rates where they still get to mark up your product. Shoot them an email or drop in with a sample. Cafes especially are often looking for unique, artisanal snacks to upsell.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take hustle, but you\u2019re already doing the hard part by making great products. It\u2019s about squeezing every ounce of value from what\u2019s already working and getting your brand in front of more eyeballs. \n\nI personally think your margins make B2B a smart move. Start with local cafes and bakeries, pitch your chocolate bars as premium accompaniments to coffee or your chips as upscale sides. Bring samples to owners or managers, and offer a trial batch at discounted rates to get your foot in the door.\n\nGourmet and organic stores are another solid avenue. Visit in person with a pitch highlighting the quality and unique appeal of your snacks. Position them as artisanal, small-batch products that stand out from mass-market options. Some of these stores might even take stock on a consignment basis, so you only pay once sales come through.\n\nCorporate gifting is worth exploring too. Small businesses often want unique gifts for employees or clients, especially around festive seasons. Put together a sample pack and reach out via email or LinkedIn, should work. \n\nIf you can handle bulk production, reach out to catering services or event planners who need premium snacks for weddings or corporate events. It\u2019s a different scale of sales but can drive bigger orders.\n\nI think you\u2019re in a niche market with a product market misfit. B2B will take persistence, but once you land a few steady partners, it\u2019ll ease the strain of relying solely on Amazon or D2C.\n\nHope this helps.

I understand swiggy might purchase the entire stock and distribute but that doesn't mean the entire sale is profit right ?","Sale of food <2%? Isn't that the core business of Swiggy?","Happy to explain some parts I understand after seeing the finances of some restaurants.\n\n* Swiggy takes around 20% of the order value as its commission. This is why you find different pricing when you eat at the restaurant and you order online- the mark up is to facilitate Swiggy's commission and the 18% GST thereon (Restaurants file under composition scheme and therefore can't claim GST- therefore this needs to be picked up from the customer).\n* Over and above this, you may see a platform fee on the Swiggy app. While this must be a very small portion, the commission income and this platform fee together are Income from Platform Services.\n* They also obtain delivery charges (delivery partner fee) from customers which as per the app, goes to the delivery agent to ensure he gets a fair wage. However, whether this gets reflected in the above revenue or not cannot be seen. Curiously when I reverse work the GST on an order, I find that GST on platform fee at 18% and food charges at 5% is what tallies with the GST as per invoice. Since delivery partner fee does not have a GST Component which does not reflect in the invoice, I would take the assumption that Swiggy does not see this as its own revenue. But, I don't know how they account for this- as an escrow mechanism?\n* I agree with u\/The-_-Conquerer on his comments on revenue recognition. I must also mention that when I pursued previous year financials, they made gross losses on Instamart (cost of purchase was greater than sales). I hope that has reversed and they have at least an operating profit for the division. Of course, the loss is because they have invested in growth. But these businesses are difficult to survive because they have wafer thin margins (things like wastage, a delayed truck and another hundred parameters) and therefore your costs need to be under control from Day 1.","does platform services include income from advertising ?","Makes money?

Because VCs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden. Quick refunds, more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup.\n\nMany VCs now know that the market size for these services in India is small. So, VC funding is drying up. To remain alive these companies now need to become profitable. For that they need to try and extract that marginal cost. This can be through:\n\n1. Smaller fleets to reduce cost. This causes delivery times to go up.\n2. Bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size. This again causes delivery times to go up.\n3. Asking extra money if bunching isn't opted by customers.\n4. Saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons. This causes customer support quality to go down. Extra checks on claims, asking for pics, emails etc.\n5. Increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue.\n6. Hiking prices on subscriptions. Because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service. It is counter intuitive but true.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies. I use Swiggy and Bbinstant a lot. It has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak.","They are grouping order nowadays, in last 3-4 months I've had delivery person going in opposite direction, coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls, trying to search through my order in their bag, turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me.\u00a0","At least Blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem.

Yes, black looks cool on Insta and other socials but piss poor visibility in the rains. Riding gear that is bright, and has sufficient reflection panels to get noticed in the rain and darker conditions is a must. Hell, you may get more visibility in bright PINK.\n\nRiding gloves that are rain resistant is now a norm vs. a luxury feature. Don't cheap out here. Wet hands, cold hands, etc. will mean loss of control and grip on the control surface.\n\nGet riding boots. No decathlon or woodlands stuff plz. A good pair of riding boots that offer ankle and toe protection is a must given the crappy road conditions. Injury to your feet will take longer to heal and impact more than your mobility. Don't cheap out here. Riding boots for the most part are rain resistant. Don't go for comfort. Go for protection.\n\nCheck if your helmet has the option to fit a visor with a pinlock. Helps a lot to reduce fogging on the inside. For those who wear glasses, any sprays that reduce fogging on the lenses plus shampoo can help but not the definitive way sadly. In slow-moving traffic, you will fog up regardless.\n\nOld school rain cover which goes down to your ankles is a nice thing to have. Often, the jackets will let water into your back, thru the neck or trousers. A cheap bright rain cover to go over the riding gear can keep you dry from the neck down.\n\nIf your office bag does not have a rain cover, get one. These are just a few hundred bucks and can keep things dry. Any bright colors again are a must-have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the bike:\n\nKeep the brakes in good condition. Sudden applications will be the norm with hidden potholes in the puddles and others changing direction without warning.\n\nI'd keep tire pressures a couple of PSI lower than OEM to help with more traction on the wet and slippery roads. This is subjective and depends on the rider's experience and skill level.\n\nWhile riding, stay on the right side of the vehicle in front. Drivers often swerve to avoid potholes on their side vs. the passenger side. If they swerve, you do the same but maintain a good distance.\n\nNo tailgating in the rain. Your stopping distance will be more than double vs. in the dry. If another Activa or Auto gets in between, let them. You keep a safe distance and reach your destination safely.\n\nI'd avoid rain covers for phones unless really necessary for navigation. Often, the phones can overheat inside quite fast. Charging while on the move in the rain is risky moisture or water can go along the cable and into the port.\n\nAfter reaching home safely, give the bike a quick wash, especially around the wheels, brakes, and chain. Dirt and other debris can collect if the roads are inundated and affect the bike later on, if not cleaned.","Get the phone protection cover and also please use a waterproof laptop cover\/bags with a raincoat to protect your laptops inside the bag.","Wear gloves so your hands don't slip, buy the ones with grips.","Buy a second hand nano :)","1.)Proper helmet and full body raincoat. \n\n2.) Reduce your speed and maintain a safe \ndistance from other vehicles. Brake carefully. \n\n3.) Avoid puddles as you can\u2019t judge their depth. \n\n4.) Watch out for slippery surfaces like sand, oil as they become more slippery when wet.","Buy a crocs type footwear and keep in your 2 wheeler or bag.

Here are few other things that I think are very important. \n\n1. Ride slower than what you feel would be okay. The roads are slippery as hell and braking distance is almost always more than what you expect, especially under emergency braking. More so if your vehicle does not have ABS. \nRule of thumb: while braking squeeze the lever gently and slowly build pressure. \n\n2. Check you tires, they should have sufficient depth in the grooves. \n\n3. Coat you spectacles or visors of the helmet with shaving cream or shampoo to avoid fogging.\nEdit: For point 3, coat and dry wipe with a soft cloth.

These friendships are the backbone of our lives\u2014unsung heroes that quietly support us through every high and low. And maintaining that bond despite the miles is no small feat.\n\nWhen I read this quote, it hit me hard. I cried, thinking about how much I miss her and how important our friendship is to me. It's not easy being far away from someone who knows you inside out, who shares your dreams, and who has been there through thick and thin.\n\nEven though we may not see each other often, I believe our friendship is just as strong, if not stronger. Every call, message, and shared memory bridges the distance between us.\n\nI just wanted to share this and remind everyone to cherish their long-distance friendships.

Swiggy One has given a decent service since 6 months now. Also as mentioned in other post, you get benefits on Instamart as well. Apparently..I have used Instamart more than Swiggy !","Zomato pro plus (I think you need to be invited to buy this)","Swiggy one. Any day.","Zomato Pro Plus. For groceries blinkit(Rs 5 delivery charge) and big basket now(free delivery) are more than enough.","I have saved over 35k in a year because of Zomato Pro discount on dining. Swiggy one doesn't extend to dining which is a major drawback. Find restaurants where they have pro discount on dining and go there. Totally worth it.","Swiggy Super came first when it comes to delivery discount. It was amazing at that time, free delivery for every order above 99, including long distance ones, almost like Amazon Prime. Too good to be true.  \n\nThey also had 1+1 offers on delivery (as a coupon), although Instamart wasn't free (which was fine, 5rs is nothing compared to 35rs-60rs food delivery fees).    \n\nThen they downgraded Swiggy Super to Swiggy One, which includes Instamart for free but removed a lot of restaurants from free delivery and all the 1+1 offers were also gone (only 2+1 or similar offers). And free delivery is above 149 now. They have been extending it for free for me since 4 months now (I paid last time in October, when it was called Super).  \n\nI've almost stopped using Swiggy after I got Zomato Pro Plus.\n\n___\n\nAs for Zomato - Zomato Gold was awesome for dining, straight up 1+1\/2+2 offers which would save thousands.  \n \nBut Zomato Pro only offers a flat discount now for most restaurants. Their restaurant selection is also a bit on the less expensive side (so you save less overall).  \n\nRecently though, Zomato introduced Pro Plus which makes all deliveries free, I paid 399 for 3 months. Which is just like old Swiggy Super. So I have less reason to use Swiggy apart from different discounts and delivery time (Swiggy is faster on avg.) \n\nHowever I have a feeling that this is a limited time offer just so people like me have a reason to use Zomato.  \n\n___\n\nHonorable mention is Dineout, I used to go to restaurants and abuse Dineout with friends. It was amazing before COVID. Flat cashbacks, 1+1 (which could be redeemed by 2 people per table), etc. Now they have some pathetic PromoCash thing which limits cashback usage, some restaurants are stingy to accept Dineout Pay, etc.\n\n___\n\nIn short, you can get Swiggy One for food+grocery (and they also deliver faster than Zomato here, I think they have better algorithms). And Zomato Pro Plus for what is not covered by Swiggy One, IF you are invited to it. It's good value right now as it covers both dine in and delivery.   \n\nAnd it's a fight between Dineout Passport and Zomato Pro for dine in although these days Zomato Pro is probably better. \n\nLooking at the discounts, I \"saved\" around 60k (supposedly) in delivery fees between Swiggy Super, Swiggy One and Zomato Pro Plus in the past 4 years (yes, I order a LOT). For Dine in, maybe 5-15k per year (averaged due to COVID) on Dineout Passport and not a lot on Zomato Pro (because I didn't dine in a lot).    \n\nI have Swiggy One (it's been extended for free since 4 months now, don't know the cost. Last paid 399 in October 2021) and Pro Plus (399 for 3 months). Apart from that, Amazon Prime. Will get Dineout Passport if I start going out (honestly not anytime soon until metro line 7 launches until Andheri).  \n\nAnyway, as of recently, all of my food deliveries keep getting delayed (I have a suspicion that \"delivery partners\" are double dipping to make up for fuel prices) so I am considering ordering less.  \n\nAnyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk.","Zomato."],"2165":["Just get in touch with the customer care.

English\/Hindi works in most of the places (some auto drivers too speak English). In other places you can just say that you don't understand Malayalam, they politely connect with someone who can speak English\/Hindi. And some Malayalam you will learn gradually.\n2. I hope this has been answered by many people.\n3. Getting an independent house with garden will be tough within your budget. Property rates in Kakkanad is min 20k\/month for a semi furnished 2bhk in gated societies.\n4. All grocery apps work. Sweet shops are less, so if you have capital, do start a bengali sweet shop.\n5. I have had 5-6 different house helps and cooks till now, all of them were from North.\n\nIt's a metro in making. Peaceful with clean air. Good people everywhere.\n\nSome cons:\n\n1. Festivals of North aren't celebrated with equal zeal except in a few places. For ex- Unless you are in a Holi event , you won't even know it's Holi.\n2. No pubs\n3. Very narrow roads and traffic jams during peak hours in city hotspots.","1. Not an issue\n2. Pet healthcare scene is great. But I don\u2019t think 24*7 hospitals are there.\n3. Most of kochi is peaceful. You should come down and look at flats. Kakkanad might be a good bet.\n4. Apps are there but supermarkets are ubiquitous and much more convenient. They also deliver.\n5. Many North Indian housemaids are available and most Malayali maids speak basic English but broken.","1. Wont be an issue in most cases if you can speak in English to most people, and Hindi to many less. Minor inconvenience, but you will pickup basic malayalam to survive pretty soon. \n2. There are many reliable Vets and few 24\/7 hospitals. You can network with other pet parents from community and Subhash park on certain weekdays.\n3. The whole Kerala is pretty well connected with decent internet. Fiber connectivity exists everywhere in city and suburbs.\n4. Instamart cover 100% of city and Kakkanad. Blinkit just started last month and is ramping up.\n5. Hindi speaking maids are plenty. There is a reliable agency called maidinkochi (not sure name is right) who provide only vetted Hindi speaking maids. I have tried them before.","I have seen others give you good advice regarding moving to Kochi. I have something to ask that's on the other end of the spectrum, per se.\n\nWhy exactly are you moving to Kochi? You guys have Wfh, are non-malayalis, have 3 dogs. So, why choose Kochi?\nPlease don't take this in any other way; I'm just curious.\n\nThe kerala weather is nothing to boast of. The heat is unbearable at times, and Kochi is slowly becoming polluted and the air quality is decreasing per year.\n\nIf you have the option to relocate to any place, why choose Kochi? Why not somewhere near the mountains where the air is purer and the facilities, though may be few, do exist?\nYou'll get better environment for your budget, and better space for your dogs. So, why Kochi? :)","1. Neither of us speak Malayalam\u2014will that be a problem?  \n- it won't be a problem as Kochi has all kinds of people living here. \n\n2. How\u2019s the pet healthcare scene in Kochi? Like, are there reliable vets and 24x7 hospitals?  \n- yes, we do have many good pet hospitals, both public and pvt. But I doubt if there are any 24x7 pet hospitals.\n\n3. We're homebodies who love our peace and WiFi. Any areas you\u2019d recommend with good neighbourhood and uninterrupted internet connectivity?\n- There are many good neighbourhoods in and around the city, especially in Kaloor, Kadavantra, Panampilly, Changampuzha park, MG road etc. and connectivity won't be a problem here in Kochi, imo. But for renting an independent house with a garden where you can accommodate 3 dogs can be a tough task. I rarely see house owners renting out their properties to people with pets. Even if you need an independent house with garden, you'll have to pay 30k+ per month.\n\n4. Are apps like Zepto, Blinkit, or Swiggy Instamart a thing there for groceries and supplies?  \nBlinkit, Instamart and bb has got good service here. I don't know if zepto is available.\n\n5. What about house help? Since we don\u2019t know the language (yet!), would it be tough to find reliable help in the beginning?  \nYou can find part time househelp with the help of some agencies. But I think a full time house help would be hard to find, but still you can manage to get it if you're ready to pay.","Hey we're North Indians been living in Kochi suburbs (a village) for 8 years now... \n-Language isn't an issue... We still don't speak Malayalam (it's a hard tongue and we northies anyway get corrected when we try to speak)\n- Pet hospitals are aplenty and pet supply shops are also many... We liked Cochin Pet Hospital \n- Independent houses are a better bet, many societies are not allowing pets, especially dogs (ours didn't) ...so make sure you check\n- Look for suburban areas, cheaper, cleaner and even cooler\n- if you are moving for your dogs, assess the areas to see if other people have pets in the area...

But I just can't wrap my head around it. Kuch gadbad hai. \n\nI am soooo happy someone else also feels that there's something heavily wrong with Zomato. \n\nMein akele pagal nahi hoon","Ever since they posted \u201cadjusted EBIDTA\u201d I\u2019ve steered away from the company.","Also a huge chunk of their revenue comes from hyperpure. Have you factored in that? Thats around 27% of Zomato's total revenue.","For some reason, i have never not good vibes from deepinder goyal. Obv this is a random statement but over the years i have realised that our gut instinct is generally right!","Infoedge is one of the largest shareholders of Zomato and Sanjeev sits on the board. I would like to believe that if Deepinder is the crazy one, Sanjeev would have a steady hand. \n\nCo-founders come and go in Zomato and come back again. Eg. Dhindsa was working with Zomato before he started Grofers. \n\nAs long as Sanjeev is on the Board and InfoEdge is not selling their shares, I will be long on Zomato. \n\nI do agree though that valuations are largely thanks to Blinkit and now District.   \n  \nIt will come down one day. When the noise settles, I will relook the stock and maybe add more of it.","\n>With 5L orders per day and Value per order Rs. 640, Gross order value per Q in Crs is Rs. 2880 Crs. against the company claim of 4950 Cr.\n\nGOV soared from 2100Cr to 4950Cr from Q1 to Q4, its unlikely growth but still possible considering rapid expansion to T2 cities.     \nThe Times numbers might just be from Q1 or Q2.     \n\n\n\n\n>on top of this Co-founder of zomato is wife of Blinkit CEO and she has resigned today\n\nI mean she probably has more money than she can imagine with these share prices lol.    \n\n\n>Further in 2 years the company turned from 1200 Cr loss to 351 Cr profit with the same business model and nominal increase in charges.\n\nHyperpure has been very good for them, and the charges have increased considerably.    \nDiscounts are lower, blinkit charges delivery for all, platform fee has been raised practically every quarter (and that's legit pure profit), gold benefits have reduced. With the scale that Zomato operates in(1.3M orders a day) even 2\u20b9 difference per order is a lot.    \nNot to mention a logistics company, if operating in selected locations, will always benefit with increase in order numbers in terms of efficiency of delivery. Delivery routes get cheaoer to operate, admin\/IT costs vs reveue ratio gets much better, the developer or admin team isn't expanding as much.     \nAlso rise in share prices gives them a lot more flexibility while hiring top talent.    \n\nZomato is now a highly scrutinized public company, I doubt they're cooking their books.","https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c0m6v184nhrd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be281d3bdafdda0059fb7b4030bade007a34163\n\nIf we look at the source of cash, then its visible that they are generating cash from operations only, as their **cash from investments is negative** and they turned profitable from operations only in previous FY. So unless some \"creative accounting\" is done it could be **legit**","Omg. How is SEBI missing what a random redditor found out from back of a napkin calculations. All those CAs doing accounting, all those private investors doing diligence and a random redditor found how Zomato has been lieing.\/s\n\nOn a serious note, dude these numbers are scrutinized over a lot more than you think. And if they really were cooking their numbers, they won't be stupid to not cook their AOV or daily order numbers.

Swiggy is one of India's leading food and grocery delivery platforms with a strong market position\\[1\\]\\[2\\].\n\n\n\n2. The company has shown steady revenue growth, with FY24 revenues at Rs 11,634 crore, up 36.1% year-on-year\\[6\\].\n\n\n\n3. Swiggy has expanded into quick commerce through Instamart, which now accounts for 40% of its revenue\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n4. The IPO pricing appears reasonable compared to competitor Zomato, with Swiggy valued at 7.8 times Price\/Sales\\[4\\].\n\n\n\n5. There is strong investor interest, with big investors placing bids worth over $15 billion\\[5\\].\n\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n1. Swiggy is still unprofitable, with a net loss of Rs 2,350 crore in FY24\\[6\\]. Analysts estimate it may take 5-6 quarters to turn profitable\\[9\\].\n\n\n\n2. The company faces intense competition from Zomato, which has outperformed Swiggy recently in revenue and profitability metrics\\[7\\].\n\n\n\n3. There are concerns about urban demand slowdown and foreign investor outflows weighing on the market\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n4. The grey market premium indicates muted listing gains of only around 5%\\[1\\]\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n5. Some analysts caution against investing due to ongoing losses and high valuation\\[4\\].\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Swiggy IPO presents a mixed picture. While the company has strong growth potential in the food delivery and quick commerce segments, its lack of profitability and intense competition are key concerns. The reasonable pricing compared to Zomato provides some comfort.\n\n\n\nFor long-term investors comfortable with high risk, the IPO may be worth considering given Swiggy's market position and growth prospects. However, more conservative investors may want to wait for signs of profitability before investing. Those looking for listing gains should likely avoid the IPO given the muted grey market premium.\n\n\n\nUltimately, investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the risks and their own risk appetite before making a decision. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended.","Verdict: you will get a better price than Amitabh Bachchan to enter the Swiggy stock..chill out right now"],"2578":["\nIf you haven't already, please add your own analysis\/opinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a Low Effort post.\n\nPlease DO NOT ask for BUY\/SELL advice without sharing your own opinions with reasons first.

Their Revenue in FY 2024 was\u00a012,961 Cr.**\n\n**Swiggy is at $13.3 Billion. Their Revenue is in FY 2024 was 11,247 Cr.**\n\n# \n\nSo with \\~80% of the Revenue, Swiggy stands at \\~50% Valuation. The 2 things which justify this discount are (1) Swiggy is not Public. (2) Swiggy is not profitable.\n\n(1) is about to change soon. So the real question is- will Swiggy turn proftiable? Do they have the ability todo what Zomato did? They have been cutting down on losses. If I remember correctly, last FY, they slashed their losses by \\~40%. But they did still lose 2,350.24 Cr. They still have a while before they turn profitable and the market is factoring that in for the valuation.\n\n\n\n\\[Opinion\\] However, the current $13 billion is justified. Comparing them to Zomato who have an identical business model. Yet Zomato is having 2x the valuation with only 1.15x revenue. The private nature of the company and non profitability show this but this isn't crazy. Both of these factors can change within a couple years. The market is discounting all this and has come to a fair valuation here. It isn't overvalued or undervalued.","In August, another US investor, Baron Capital, valued the company even higher at $14.74 billion as of June 2024.\n\nSwiggy's updated valuation comes as the company has filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).\n\nThe company plans to raise Rs 3,750 crore through a fresh issue of shares and an offer for sale of up to 18.52 crore shares. In total, the IPO could amount to around Rs 10,414 crore, or $1.25 billion.\n\nThere are plans to increase the IPO size by an additional Rs 1,250 crore, which is about $150 million. If approved, this would bring the total IPO size to Rs 11,664 crore, or $1.4 billion. The decision regarding this increase will be made at the company's extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on October 3.\n\nSwiggy's financial performance shows some encouraging signs. For the financial year 2024 (FY24), the company reduced its losses by 44%, down to Rs 2,350 crore from Rs 4,179 crore in the previous year (FY23). During the same period, Swiggy's revenue grew by 36%, reaching Rs 11,247 crore, up from Rs 8,265 crore.\n\nHowever, in the first quarter of the financial year 2025 (Q1 FY25), Swiggy reported a slight increase in losses, which rose by 8% to Rs 611 crore, compared to Rs 564 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThis increase in losses was attributed to rising expenses. On a positive note, the company's revenue from operations during this period was Rs 3,222.2 crore, marking a 35% increase from Rs 2,389.8 crore in Q1 FY24.\n\nSwiggy operates in a competitive market, with many other food delivery services also vying for customers. The company has been focusing on expanding its services beyond food delivery into quick commerce, where it aims to deliver groceries and other items quickly.","India doesn't have adequate market for EVs but it does have market for fast food delivery so anyday I would say likes of Swiggy and Zomato will have higher valuation than Ola.","Valuation doesn't matter.

As a foodie who loves to cook but don't find much time these days due to a busy schedule, I couldn't stop myself from posting about this product that I happened to order by chance when I was in Kolkata through instamart. They are instant liquid mixes so you don't have to do anything except for adding protein of your choice and cook. I've only tried these two flavours and the taste is heavenly and has that exact Bengali taste to it so for those who crave for a good Kosha Mangsho\/Paturi but can't make them, this is an amazing alternative.  \n\nPro tip:   \n\nFor the Kosha Mangsho, even though the packet says you can just add mutton with the liquid and cook instantly ,I first marinade the mutton with the mix and let it sit for six hours and then cook it in mustard oil.  \n\nFor the mustard fish liquid, a little goes a long way since it has a lot of jhaanjh and is spicy as well. So the pack lasted for a week for me and I cooked four dishes- borir jhaal, shorshe bhindi, chingri maach shorshe diye and prawn paturi with it. The paste was good for a week in the fridge.\n\nNext on my list is to try their Chingri Malaikari and Champaran Mutton paste.","Thank you for posting. We appreciate your contribution to r\/Kolkata.
