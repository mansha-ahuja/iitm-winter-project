I want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are.\n\n* Aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n* people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n* All meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n* A lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least. \n* there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30,000 inr\n* customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n* the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n* the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake. since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n* Junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n* the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n* A lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin. even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n* There are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n* at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n* yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n* many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","1":"Zepto didn\u2019t realize that saying goodbye to Mumbai and forcing half the staff to quit would lead to leaks of inside news.

Always pay 60 rupees extra on each order in the name of delivery fee, convenience etc.\n2. Overspending on these apps to reach a minimum order value. \n3. Buying vegetables is a hassle here.\n\nWhat if we had an option of getting a delivery within 15 mins of your groceries from the nearby Kirana Stores in a radius of 5km. \n\n- this increases the visibility of that store\n- and removes the convenience charge for the consumer\n- it also plays on the factor of trust, where you buy stuff from your trusted kirana store near you.\n\nHow to make money?\n\n- the consumer pays a monthly pass of 500 for using the platform with zero convenience fees and delivery charges.\n- the kirana stores pay a fee to use the platform. \n\nIs this something that would interest you?","8":"","9":"\nSo, here\u2019s the tea:\n\ud83d\udd38 Product Price on Zepto: \u20b91388\n\ud83d\udd38 Product Price on Amazon: \u20b9934\n\nThat\u2019s a \u20b9454 difference, just to get it delivered in 5 minutes.

These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns. By using a budget device, you might avoid being flagged as a high-value target.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: This is especially helpful for users in the age range of Gen Z, as they're frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns.

And till this day, I've never used it except to spend Zepto cash on something I *really* need (essentials only)\n\nAnd I spend it very carefully. I used to get almost \u20b9125 daily for a few days then it reduced to \u20b975, so I buy only the stuff that is Zepto cash eligible. I used it once for the 25% promo and \u20b9125 to almost get a free delivery and only buy stuff where I'm making minimum cutoff amount of \u20b999 and spending the bare minimum. \n\nI once just tried to fill the cart with I may or may not need, and saw this surge fee where the code leaked. (Not a coder, so if someone can make sense of it, lemme know). Ofc I deleted most items later to not spend on it.\n\nI don't have their stupid pass subscription because they just want you to activate it to show the investors, so I intentionally decline it every time, only to see a \u20b91 difference, so I just don't buy it. \n\nI also don't need any paper bags, I have plenty. But since I'm keen on Zepto failing like another byjus, I specifically untick it to add the bag to my already existing pile of bags.\n\nI only order essentials, where zepto looses money, and use the free cash to pay for it. \n\nTill date in a total of 10 orders I've not paid anything more than a total for ~200-300 max (that too because I had friends at home once), so yeah, a net order spend of ~\u20b925.\n\nSo yeah, if you hate zepto, and really want to see it fail, I'd suggest you follow this strategy.\n\nI mean ofc, this case is an exception, and not the general crowd is like this, but I thought I'll just put it out in the open for once.\n\nAnd yeah if you want 25% off on your next order (upto 200) let me know lol I'll send the referral link to you on DM. Ofc, I get something similar too, but upto 800, which I'm sure I won't spend on the app, so yeah. Idk. I just want to watch zepto burn.\n\nWhy so much hate? Because I want the VCs behind Zepto to realise that burning money isn't gonna get you anywhere. Principles of business stay the same. You're trying to cash out on a greater fool theory only to dump it to dumb retail investors and please your silent partners. It's sort of an ego thing of forcing zepto to make money by burning money, and making Aadit a puppet. Just stop doing this and be real for once.","16":"Aadit and Kaivaliya both are great founders love them but at the rate they are moving which is important that's the most common choice they have to compete in highly competitive market.\n\nThey need to highly work in the product before the marketing not having a Moat is hurting them in a long-term which I'm sure they know, in the last few months I have seen more 8-9 switch from zepto to blinkit in family and friends\n\nZepto does have a loyal customer base but it's smaller.\n\nI don't know how zepto can miss the customer behaviour point because of which they are facing the high churn rate even though it's normal for start-ups like at this stage due many factors like experimenting with pricing, user experience and more.\n\nIf the plan is selling Zepto to Zomeone or to Amazon then I have to say it's really interesting to see them moving forward so agressively which make sense.","17":"Do you think Zepto and Blinkit are good for our economy?\n\nIf not 10 mins what is the maximum time you can wait for an order to come?","18":"","19":"","20":"Recent allegations suggest Zepto charges different prices based on your phone model. While unverified, this claim opens a larger question about how India's newest unicorn is reshaping retail through data.\n\nZepto's growth is undeniable: From 50 dark stores in 2021 to over 750 today, with plans for 1,200 by March 2025. Their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from \u20b977 crore to \u20b9250-300 crore. Yet investors have poured in $1.35 billion in 2024 alone. Why?\n\nThe answer lies in what they're really building: a massive consumer behavior database. Each dark store isn't just a warehouse - it's a data collection center tracking thousands of households' purchasing patterns, brand preferences, and price sensitivities.\n\nFMCG companies are noticing. Industry sources indicate major brands are creating Zepto-specific products and packages. The power dynamic is shifting - when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers, traditional retail relationships change.\n\nThe expansion raises questions. In Mumbai alone, over 200 local retail spaces now house Zepto's dark stores. Each requires specific zoning permissions, affecting local real estate markets. Meanwhile, internal documents mention development of \"back-end mother hubs\" automation systems, even as the company aggressively hires with above-market salaries.\n\nTheir \"SuperSaver\" feature requires minimum orders of \u20b9999 - a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior. Combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics, it suggests a broader plan for market control.\n\nThe environmental impact deserves scrutiny. With 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips, the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured.\n\nZepto promises an IPO within 24 months while planning major operational changes. Their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by March 2025. These timelines create interesting questions about their long-term strategy.\n\nWhat we're witnessing might be more than quick commerce. It's potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience. Every order, every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how India shops.\n\nThe implications warrant discussion. How will this affect local retail networks? What happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value? When does convenience become control?\n\nThese aren't hypothetical concerns. The next time your phone lights up with a Zepto notification, consider: You might be feeding data into a system that's fundamentally changing India's retail landscape, one 10-minute delivery at a time.","21":"It was a shitpost. Even when I use the flair people thought I was serious. Why would I give the referral codes if I genuinely hated it. But yeah, herd mentality.

If yours didn't work, buy one. They say it to your face without an ounce of shame.\n2. The upper management was absolute worst. They micromanaged, got into EVERY thing. Be it a banner or a minor digital script. No trust on employees\n3. Extremely shitty people. Toxic af. Talked as if we owed them. One of them was also accused of #metoo. But who cares about women's safety, right? We want just profit.\n4. Nobody was on time. All the meetings were delayed without fail. Time wasted.\n5. Worked every weekend without a break. They ask you to do it as if you were a slave. Again, no shame.\n6. Put unnecessary pressure on employees. Spread panic for no reason at all. Every pitch was a nightmare.\n7. Redid decks over and over again. Every person had a different point of view. There was absolutely no care for people's mental health.\n8. The admin was shit. The lady spewed bullshit for no reason. Screaming and misbehaving with everyone. No HR to complain. No raises for two years at a time from what I know.\n9.

Here\u2019s the cool part: when the battery runs low (about 80 km range), riders can simply swap their bike for a fully charged one at designated stations around the city, so there\u2019s no downtime!\n\n**The Problem It Solves:**\n\n* High fuel costs for delivery riders using petrol bikes\n* Limited job access for people without their own bike\n* Affordable transportation options for students\n\n**Why R2R Works:**\n\n1. Cuts delivery costs by replacing fuel with low-cost electric bike rentals.\n2. Opens up delivery jobs to people without bikes (e.g., students, freshers).\n3. Provides a cheap way for students to get around the city.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nI\u2019m currently exploring fleet logistics, pricing, and partnerships with local companies to make this happen.

However if you're working on a venture with a reasonable AOV required to sustain and grow, your target market is the 10 million who can afford to.\n\nI am not talking about low cost services and products that require constant funding from VCs or some other chum to stay afloat. If you forget about these VC subsidised offerings, and focus on growing on a healthy trajectory, these are the only people you need to think about. \n\nThis is how I arrived at the 10 million. By looking at phone sales data. \n\nApple is projected to sell at least 12 million Iphones in India in 2024. Let's say 6 million are buying the high end expensive pro phones and they're doing this in India, which means they live here and will continue to live here and not run away abroad. \n\nLet's give the rest of the 4  million to Samsung and others. \nSamsung sells a lot of phones but only a few million high end ones. Those are the only ones you need to focus on. \n\nYour target market is around 10 million people and your projected market is another 10 million at best. India is experiencing mass emigration to other countries, extreme inequality, very high taxes. It is very unlikely your target market will grow past 20 million in the next 5 years. \n\nForget about the 1.5 billion people argument, 99% won't be useful for your startup.

The path drone follows is the main USP for this total project.\n4. The backend algorithm collabs with the ride apps such as Uber\/ola, etc.,\n   1. The algorithm works as follows\n   2. The algorithms, gets track of all the live rides going on with the ride apps(ref. Point4)\n   3. Then calculates the nearest point where drone can get on the vehicles participating in the live rides.\n   4. The drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicle(auto\/cab\/etc.,) to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top.\n   5. During the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone.\n      1. Scenario 1: If vehicle stuck in traffic, then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer.\n      2. Scenario 2: When vehicle is taking different route than the destination, then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle.\n\n\u00a0\n\n* This method is useful in cases of emergencies, medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time.\n* The business like zepto\/blinkit can reduce their dark stores.\n* The delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part.\n* The complications happens from the drones can be reduced.\n\nI hope I can get lot of insights from talented people out there.","62":"Why are quick commerce companies using nearby shops to deliver groceries and investing lakhs of rupees in building dark stores?","63":"I left India in my 20s lived in eu for few years & settled in US for 2 deacdes , but still travel globally every week including visits to India every month , so I observe & compare these markets very closely.\n\nIndia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017. The digital currency, ondc & several transformational initiatives. Stock Market is riding high on the modi wave , so is Inflation , purchasing power & rupee valuations (may be on purpose ) has gone down  drastically. Cost of a good meal is same or higher in India compared to US\/EU , but income isn't comparable.\n\nI keep seeing lots of startups coming up , but none are able to succeed on a global platform , several are acquired by west backed competition ,  most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west. \n\nExcept a lenskart , zoho , bookmyshow & a few more handful, none of them have succeeded in global arena. Why is that? If the product was good ,it should have , right ?  I understand some business need not go global , but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nUbers, amazons were  able to Penetrate indian markets & eat local share , but a ola or flipkart hasn't gone global .\nZomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses , Oyo has acquired lot of properties , but they just loss making properties & are still in losses.  \n\nWith the largest pie of IT engineers in the world , we haven't had a single app\/product that's globally used, we have only been a consumer market. With 12 % of world population & biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\nI remember using flipkart in the beginning once & the website design & layout itself were a mimic of Amazon forget the business model , I had doubts if they will succeed , but ended up being sold for billions. \n\nMama earth is a rip off of Babyganics including its branding &  green colors, but it's valued at 5000 cr .\n\nWe keep seeing lots of half baked products on Indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr+ . \n\nThere was a lot of VC funding coming , so valuation game was On , but lately foreign VC funding  has dried up , as most investments are yielding profits & exits are just based in hype based valuations.\n\nZepto is a great example , how a company with no unique IP is valued so much & already people are claiming its model is a failure &  not scalable. Those 2 young kids don't have the same charm or intellect that we saw in Gates or jobs when they were young. Lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nThe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success , whereas in India we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nBut how long will this circus last ? Only till VC funds dry up or when NRI\/rich Indians stop pumping into this game ?\n\n I am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent , we are capable , but the new set of Heros that are projected aren't worth it & my concern is that they don't oversell & fail ,  making it worse for future entrepreneurs","64":"Do you agree?

","69":"","296":"Time is 1:48 am right now and I decided to order some snacks while watching inception, this was my first time ordering with zepto so i got a free premium pass with this order resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products. \n\nSo, the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy I have ever talked to before. Time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app, he greeted me with \"Radhe radhe\" and i greeted him back, the order was prepaid. So, he takes out my order, making small talk and being very polite, talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever(?), then he apologized for taking so long (he didn't) and calling so often for directions wagera(he didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons) I didn't know what was coming and I just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why he's so enthusiastic about it. He said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks \"Actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h, budget toght h rasin vi nai h\", I was thinking to myself 'why wouldn't he just give me my order, he's just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture' and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me \"My dad passed away a year ago\" he said with a slight tremble in his voice, \"I am having to provide for the whole family and I am not being able to, if you could, please help me out, I promise I will return you the money next week\" he said, now completely in tears and I dont know what to do, I am terrible in those situations and I just want to take my order and get back to watching Inception, I feel sorry for the guy but I dont have shit on me, I am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and I only ordered those snacks because I have only had 2 meals in 2 days, I finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and I'm gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home (but that's a different story), I cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week, even my dad died a little more than a year ago, I can relate to his pain, and if he is really telling the truth then I cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a Delivery boy. \n\nSo anyways, he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house, and I told him that I dont have any money on me and that I can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops, but he insisted that I check my gpay to see if I have some money, I dont need to check, I have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money I'm offering him, but he just kept asking for more than just 30, 40rs and I had had it with him, I told him I am sorry but I cant help him out, that I am also in a crappy situation in life right now, that I couldn't help him out even if I wanted to and finally he said its okay, he wiped his tears, \"radhe radhe\", handed me my order and then I left.\n\nThis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and I checked to see if there's a tipping option on Zepto but I couldn't find it. I know I can send him money over through gpay but I dont know, I am skeptical of everyone ever since I got scammed.

But when I got the bill, the total came to \u20b9697.28 for the items alone. They charged an extra \u20b917.28 over the MRP! Which they say as gst on delivery charges of 27 rupees.. Bc it's mehenga bhi nahi hua Hai gst\n\nOn top of that, even though I'm a Zepto Pass member (which is supposed to give me free delivery on orders above \u20b9199), they still charged me a delivery fee of \u20b927. And here's the kicker\u2014the GST on this delivery fee was \u20b917.28. How does that make sense? GST on \u20b927 shouldn't be that high.\n\nI feel completely cheated. It's not just about a few extra rupees; it's about trust and honesty. If a company is willing to overcharge and sneak in extra fees, what else are they doing behind the scenes?\n\nI reached out to customer service, but they weren't helpful. This isn't the kind of service I expected, especially from a company that prides itself on convenience and customer satisfaction.\n\nI'm sharing this to warn others:\n\nCheck your bills carefully. Don't assume the charges are correct.\n\nSpeak up if something seems off.

Did you guys have any similar experiences today?","642":"I was a daily user of Zepto for the last two months, and I even bought their monthly pass, which offers free delivery on orders above Rs. 100. However, things started getting ridiculous after this point; for every order, they charge an extra Rs. 10 as a platform and handling fee, regardless of whether you're a pass user or a normal user. \n\nMoreover, they made free delivery an optional feature. If you don't manually apply for free delivery, they'll charge you. With these tactics, they keep charging money, and I find it absurd. As a pass user, free delivery should be automatically applied, but you must tap on the free delivery option each time. This can be easily missed when you're in a rush or if kids are placing orders. \n\nNow, let's talk about grocery, fruits, and vegetable prices. Out of all the platforms, Zepto is the most expensive, especially for fruits and vegetables compared to offline stores. Sometimes, the price differences are double! For example, if Yelleki bananas cost Rs. 50\/kg in the offline market, they'll be priced at Rs. 100 on Zepto. The same applies to watermelon and other fruits. Even daily essentials like potatoes and onions have higher prices.\n\nThese apps also encourage you to spend more once you become a pass member by showing extra discounts when you make a minimum purchase of Rs. 300. As a result, most of your orders exceed Rs. 300, and you end up buying unnecessary items.\n\nTheir main goal is to increase the Average Order Value (AOV) and daily user count to achieve profitability, which they aim to do through these pass and discounted price strategies.\n\nI understand the convenience and comfort of getting groceries delivered home, but it comes at the cost of paying higher than market rates.\n\nIn my experience, you can save up to 30% monthly by not using this app.\n\nI'm not against online shopping or e-commerce; I frequently use them. In my experience, Big Basket is better for savings if you plan weekly shopping. For fruits and vegetables, local stores are a more affordable option.","643":"Hey everyone,\n\nI'm exploring a startup idea specifically targeting the garbage collection mess in Indian cities (initially Bangalore).

Zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service; however, it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least. One day it is poor Quality Control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies \/ fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 15-20 mins minimum to even reach your community \/ apartment even during non-peak hours. Their Customer Support Team does not have any empathy to begin with. They tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie Customer Support Associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced Customer Support Associate who will start a seemingly never-ending saga of questions and unnecessary cross-checks with their internal logistics and quality control teams - all when you are still on chat with them. The whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on Zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 30-45 minutes in trying to relay their concerns and\/or reach a closure. I also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code \u201cFree Delivery\u201d before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have Zepto membership or not. One has to wonder as to why so forward-thinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such tech-savvy quick commerce apps COULD NOT apply a simple auto-logic to apply \u201cFree Delivery\u201d as and when a customer or patron\u2019s cart value reaches minimum order value by default. These practices not only expose Zepto\u2019s dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers\u2019 money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value. Zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers\u2019 hard-earned money using cheap con tricks. This is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating!!!\n\nHope this effort to expose Zepto and its greedy intentions create some much-needed noise and uproar amongst Zepto\u2019s senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\u2026\n\n  #TimeToChangeZepto #StopCheating","655":"The drivers who work for Dunzo, Zepto, Swiggy are under tremendous pressure to deliver on time because of the promises made by the companies to consumers. They literally toy with their own lives and the lives of others by regularly driving on the wrong side of roads to reach on time. While the drivers are mostly the victims of te expectations set by their companies, can't we name and shame these companies for risking lives of their drivers and others by setting these expectations?

The reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners.\n\nThey set up a meeting at Chaayos, Park Square Mall. First, a person came to meet me\u2014her partner\u2014and explained that the senior partner, a lady, would come to meet me to see if I have the vision and mindset for the business and if I\u2019m like-minded enough to partner.\n\nThe lady boss came for a general introduction. She didn\u2019t say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better. She asked why I wanted to do business. My plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life. She responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere, and I insisted on not missing the monetary benefits. She asked why I hadn\u2019t started earlier, and I said I didn\u2019t have a clear idea to start with and didn\u2019t want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case. Then she talked about the mindset of Zepto\u2019s founders, a food delivery app, and how they succeeded even after dropping out. I called her out, saying she was wrong, and corrected her by saying Zepto is a food delivery app. She responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect.\n\nI asked about the business, and she said I wouldn\u2019t be able to fully understand it. Then she explained that they are in B2B e-commerce. They would set up my virtual distributor shop, and I would get distributorship rights for big corporations, selling to retailers. I would have 10-14% margins shared with all the partners. They work in collaboration, so if any other partner makes a sale, I get my share. I would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop.\n\nThere are two requirements: I have to make a quick decision and invest 4.5 lakhs. That 4.5 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop.\n\nI asked follow-up questions, and she said she couldn\u2019t tell me more about the business. Once I say yes and share my documents for verification, she would tell me more, and I would need to have the money ready. She said that once I get into the business, I would fully understand it.\n\nI asked if I wanted to know more, is there a website or something I could read on. She said no, we are protected, and there is nothing on the internet. I asked her to send me at least some documents to read, and she said she had already told me everything required. She said I need to make my decision and have the money ready, and once I\u2019m in the business, I would understand it fully. She added that if it were on the internet or so public, everyone would be doing this. We are exclusive and protected.\n\nI had a heated discussion, and she left, asking me to make the decision and inform my friends. Then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner. I said that as a partner, we need to know each other and the business well. I can\u2019t understand anything without being inside the business, she said. \n\nThis friend is more of an acquaintance, and I don\u2019t know a lot about her. How we met is an interesting story, but it doesn\u2019t add any context here.\n\nThe job requires 2-3 hours a day, done digitally. That friend bought a car recently and quit her full-time job as well.\n\nSounds like an MLM scheme or scam to me. But is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it? What is this business, how does it operate? Is it legitimate?\n\nI said no to join because I can\u2019t be part of anything I don\u2019t fully understand, and it\u2019s not public or on the internet\u2014anything protected and very private is a red flag for me, and I can\u2019t put the money in it blindly.\n\nOne more thing, they kept calling each other sir\/ma\u2019am even though they are colleagues.","659":"A tad overpriced but pretty good for how fast it gets delivered ","660":"So on Friday I had ordered a few items from Dunzo.

Apparently, she had twisted her ankle while on stairs. She further told the doctor that she is supposed to be travelling sometime mid of next week and that she didn't want to take chances as her travel involved extensive walking. I normally dont pay attention to others but she was crisp clear in her speech and it was difficult to ignore her words. \n\nAfterwards, the doctor completed his examination, told her some movements and exercises and advised her to apply ice pack on the strained area. And then the women started asking some questions around ice pack. This is where the crux of the story lies and i really paid attention to her words. \n\nHer questions were:\n1. How often to apply ice pack? \n2. How long should i apply in 1 sitting? \n3. Is ice water bath and ice pack the same? \n4. What happens if i dip my feet in ice water? \n5. Where should i apply the ice pack? \n6. Should I change the place around the sprained area when applying ice?\n7. Can i walk with sprained ankle? \n\nAnd many more frivolous question of which above 7 are just a glimpse.

That we have become so handicapped that we need expert opinion on how to apply ice pack??\n\nI try hard not to judge people on thier lack of information (and sometimes common sense) but seeing this ~50 years lady asking so many questions just on the ice pack unnerved me to the point where I started questioning the utility of all this advancement around me (in financial services, 10min delivery, medicine etc). On one hand these things have improved life standard but on the other hand, these have made us so reliant and handicapped that if blinkit\/zepto were out of vegetables for some days, some people would probably end up eating packaged food for days without bothering themselves to go to local store and buy groceries on their own. \n\nPeople should be considered about their health and right ways of doing exercises\/posture etc. But should we be so ignorant that we are having to ask minute things to professionals? \n\nI always thought that generations of millenials and onwards would be most poor in their general knowledge and common sense (being first to be exposed to mass consumer internet, rampant googling tendencies and wide internet access because of cheap rates) but seeing a middle aged person so poorly eqipped to take care of her own health makes me worried about the future of humans.

Guiding light (suggestions\/criticisms\/sarcasm\/mockery, everything is welcome!)\n\nHere's the idea:\n\nI am planning to start an e-mobility startup (strictly comprising only of e-rickshaws)  that will focus specifically on last mile connectivity. The target group for me will be the set of commuters who travel to metro station from their homes, and travel to offices after deboarding the metro and vice-versa (can also be extended to use cases like malls to metro stations or from popular tourist attractions to metro stations etc, but IMO, that's secondary). Now consider this piece of information: \"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) reported an average of 5.56 million passenger journeys per day in 2023\"\n\nConsidering an average penetration of \\~10-15% of this base and a ticket size of roughly \\~Rs 30 for a 4km ride (please bear in mind that 4km is the longest that I will operate, and a lower ticket size for lower distance rides), the TAM is \\~$ 5bn. I have also thought of getting these e-ricks to do deliveries for other aggregators (Swiggy\/Zomato\/Amazon\/Bigbasket\/Zepto\/etc etc) during off peak times (again, a secondary plan, not part of the primary idea).\n\nWhat do you guys think about this space? Is this a good problem to work on? I think that this is a good problem to solve because last mile mobility is something that is almost untapped by the current players in mobility space. Try booking a \\~4-5km ride in an Ola\/Uber, and it costs atleast Rs 120-150. My goal is to enable byte sized mobility at user-friendly rates (and keep options of shared rides as well to increase affordability and profits). \n\nIt'd be wonderful if you guys can help me with your inputs here!

At that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs, frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder.

Apparently, she had twisted her ankle while on stairs. She further told the doctor that she is supposed to be travelling sometime mid of next week and that she didn't want to take chances as her travel involved extensive walking. I normally dont pay attention to others but she was crisp clear in her speech and it was difficult to ignore her words. \n\nAfterwards, the doctor completed his examination, told her some movements and exercises and advised her to apply ice pack on the strained area. And then the women started asking some questions around ice pack. This is where the crux of the story lies and i really paid attention to her words. \n\nHer questions were:\n1. How often to apply ice pack? \n2. How long should i apply in 1 sitting? \n3. Is ice water bath and ice pack the same? \n4. What happens if i dip my feet in ice water? \n5. Where should i apply the ice pack? \n6. Should I change the place around the sprained area when applying ice?\n7. Can i walk with sprained ankle? \n\nAnd many more frivolous question of which above 7 are just a glimpse. After she had gone, even the doctor murmured something in kannada (most likely i was on the lines of - she had so many doubts) \n\nHere I got thinking that have we come to this stage where we are loosing most simplest of the home remedies known to humankind for ages (through hit and trial and experiment). That we are not able to preserve handed down knowledge from our elders in this information and digital age. That we have become so handicapped that we need expert opinion on how to apply ice pack??\n\nI try hard not to judge people on thier lack of information (and sometimes common sense) but seeing this ~50 years lady asking so many questions just on the ice pack unnerved me to the point where I started questioning the utility of all this advancement around me (in financial services, 10min delivery, medicine etc). On one hand these things have improved life standard but on the other hand, these have made us so reliant and handicapped that if blinkit\/zepto were out of vegetables for some days, some people would probably end up eating packaged food for days without bothering themselves to go to local store and buy groceries on their own. \n\nPeople should be considered about their health and right ways of doing exercises\/posture etc. But should we be so ignorant that we are having to ask minute things to professionals? \n\nI always thought that generations of millenials and onwards would be most poor in their general knowledge and common sense (being first to be exposed to mass consumer internet, rampant googling tendencies and wide internet access because of cheap rates) but seeing a middle aged person so poorly eqipped to take care of her own health makes me worried about the future of humans.

It is LTF though. Gives 2% back on UPI spends only on one category (which can be changed quarterly) but even that too can be a hit and a miss. I was barely getting any cashback. Only advantage was free credit period. Also, unless you have a Jupiter savings account (Federal Bank), you can't convert Jewels (their rewards) into real cash. Most often you get 0.4%.\n\nOn Tata Neu Infinity earnings are decent (1.5%) but you get stuck with Neu points rather than real cashback. Neu coins can only be used on Tata platforms (like Big Basket\/1mg). Tata Neu also has limits on UPI earnings (max 500 Neucoins per calendar month). Also, Tata Neu Infinity is normally a paid card, and today only new users to HDFC Bank can get it LTF under a special festive offer. Existing HDFC cardholders can't (this has been communicated to multiple people on this sub recently). HDFC Bank has refused to make my FYF Tata Neu Infinity LTF, which means I will close it before renewal as I don't see enough value to justify the Rs 1499 + GST renewal fee.\n\nComing to Kiwi Yes Bank credit card:\n\n* **2% - 5% real cashback** on scan & pay. Cashback is directly transferred to bank account when I redeem. No closed or proprietary wallet like Tata Neu, and Kiwi also transfers to any bank account, unlike Jupiter\n* Base Reward Rates are 4 Kiwis on UPI spends = 1% cashback and 2 Kiwis on non-UPI spends = 0.5% cashback. Users can subscribe to Neon for additional cashback and lounge vouchers.\n* **First Year Neon Subscription is free** for applications till Dec 31, 2024 (this is optional and user has to opt-in; can opt out Year 2 onwards)\n* Under Neon users get:\n\n\u2022 \u20602% cashback on UPI transactions and 0.50% cashback on Non-UPI transactions  \n\u2022 \u20603% cashback and 1 Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher on spends of > Rs. 50,000 in a year  \n\u2022 \u20604% cashback and 1 more Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher if spends of > Rs 1 lakh in a year  \n\u2022 \u20605% cashback and 1 more Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher if spends > Rs 1.5 lakh in a year\n\nWhen you cross Rs 50000 in spends (UPI and non-UPI) you get 3% on all UPI spends before milestone was reached, so 1% extra on transactions where earlier 2% was given. Same when you reach other milestones.\n\n* **Minimum transaction value to earn cashback is Rs.50**\n* **Maximum cashback in a calendar month is up to 1% of credit limit**, which is plenty compared to Tata Neu Infinity.\n* The card is **LTF**.\n* Kiwi App has **great UI and UX**; the Tata Neu app is very poor on UI and UX. Jupiter is fairly good, though Kiwi is the best of the lot.\n* Both UPI and Non-UPI transactions are considered for calculating milestones with the Kiwi Yes Bank credit card.\n* Kiwi Yes Bank Credit Card is also eligible for Yes Bank Credit Cards instant discount offers (e.g. on Amazon, Swiggy, etc).\n* Kiwi has separate discount offers on platforms like Swiggy, Zepto, Zomato, etc. So you get **Yes Bank offers + Kiwi offers**.\n* Excluded categories for base cashback & milestone: Fuel, Jewellery, Wallet Load, Insurance, Education, Rent, Utilities, Telecom, Government Payments, TV Cable services and EMI transactions\n* The icing on the cake for me has been the surprise cashback I get on regular UPI spends (via bank, not credit card) done on the Kiwi app. Small amounts, but certainly welcome!\n\n**Negatives**\n\n* I didn't get cashback on 1 or 2 merchant spends till date. Have got Kiwis on 99% of transactions.\n* Is great for only one year if Neon is not offered free next year, as base cashback is only 1%. However, in my experience most UPI credit cards are short lived before they implode in a devaluation, and I expect there will some new UPI credit cards next year. Super Money's superCard Plus, looking at you! Is expected soon and headlines are 3% cashback on all UPI scan and pay spends and an LTF card to boot.","1344":"Hi credit card pros,  \nI have the SBI Cashback card and it's working wonders for me.

Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S. Don't judge me as some marketing agent of Flipkart or Axis. I'm an ardent member of this sub, always looking for those tips and hacks. Also, I'm not against SBI CB, HDFC swiggy or millenia, I too have SBI CB, it's a beast that I happily use for other purposes. It's just that I haven't closed my FK Axis rn, bearing that \u20b9590 annually \ud83d\ude05, cuz who knows. And Axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past. If you can use and keep it all, better. But, always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robo-thinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber.","1350":"So few days ago ,park plus removed pay via credit card from payment options for majority of gift cards except apay and zepto!\n\nWe could still buy apay vouchers using credit card which i did 2 days ago and got the cashback as well ,but today i couldn't see credit card option unfortunately:(\n\nCan someone comfirm the same?","1351":"I am trying to figure out a credit card that can give me maximum savings and rewards\n\n1.

I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback?

The title says it all - I need to get a credit card to start building up my score. This will be my first card. \n\nI am 31, have a decent job, and a decent-ish salary. I have two accounts in different banks, and I keep the balance in my expense account pretty low, and replenish as needed.\n\nI live in an expensive city, and a big chunk goes into rent (which is steep). \n\nOther than that, my biggest expenses are daily ones (groceries, ordering in, bills, a few utilities+repairs, and commute). So, most of my money goes to zomato, swiggy, blinkit, zepto, ola, and uber. Occasionally going out with friends. I have a netflix subscription, and a yearly hotstar renewal. Also pay salary to the didi who comes to my flat.  A couple of times a month, I may buy something online for myself or someone (myntra\/nykaa\/amazon\/etc).\n\nI am actively working on reducing expenses, and I've started steps to come up with a side hustle.\n\nLike I said, I want to start building my CIBIL score (it is currently in the low 700s) and create a reliable credit history, as I anticipate a few loans in my future (1.5 to 2 yrs down the line).\n\n  \nWhat would be a good credit card to apply for, given the nature of my expenses?

Yearly one domestic and one international trips, yearly Jio broadband bill and other premium payments\n7. Many UPI transactions\n8.

Total spend is about 2 odd lakhs a year.\n\nAxis Neo, I use for BSNL broadband bills and movie tickets (5% discount) and my act broadband bill (I get 5% cashback on this), will close act connection and move to Airtel connection then shift to Airtel card. And 1 10% off order on blinkit. Total expenses here is about 30-40k a year.\n\nAxis Airtel (applied and approved, yet to receive)\nWill move my Airtel bill and electricity bills to this card.

Swiggy\/Zomato\/zepto and other food expenses and any other online shopping which is not on tata brands or Flipkart\/Amazon as it gives 0.5% better returns than axis Flipkart. I exhaust my 10k limit for 10% cashback on groceries and food hence applied for Airtel axis. Net card expenses here are about 1.5 to 1.75 lakhs a year. I also use it for lounges and my goto lounge is not available on axis cards.\n\nIndusind legend. Got this for lounge and movie 1+1 but for some reason it never accepts 1+1 offer on movies. If anyone can guide how to avail pls do.\n\nTata neu plus. Use it for UPI spends and Tata neu purchases. Electricity bills which will be partly moved to Airtel axis once I get it. Total spends about 2 lakh per annum on his card. I also use it for lounges as my goto lounges are not available on axis cards.\n\nMy flight tickets are done either on Flipkart axis or tata depending on where I am getting more return at that specific time frame. Total about 3 round trips a year totalling to 40k. These 40k are already included in the 2 lakh each ou Flipkart and Tata spends explained above.\n\nI am planning to get American express platinum trav card for rent. As my rent application supports it. My net rent is just north of 3 lakhs and I can hit the remainder 1lakh milestone from gift vouchers and redirectkng tata and axis flipkart purchases here.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","1434":"Federal bank offering a  lifetime free card.

I plan to do that once the list is more complete.  \n\n   Right now, it\u2019s easier for people to comment and give feedback here, which helps me update it quickly.\n\n2. **Work-life balance is subjective:**  \n   I know that everyone\u2019s experience with work-life balance can be different.  \n\n   My goal is to show a general idea of a company\u2019s culture based on feedback from the community. This way, it gives others some guidance, even though it might not apply to every individual.\n\n3. **About adding new companies:**  \n   Someone pointed out that I had added Zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers. Thanks for that!  \n\n   Now, I\u2019m checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list. If your suggested company isn\u2019t on the list yet, it\u2019s because I\u2019m still verifying their hiring status.\n\n4. **Focus on experienced professionals:**  \n   This list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals, but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference. It can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures.\n\n\nEdit:-\n\nSorting it Alphabetically so that it is easier to find company names\nChanging Low Paying to Mid Paying\n\nChanges made so far \n- Removed VMWare\n- Moved Broadcom from Low Paying good WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Twitter\n- Moved Ola from Unknown WLB to mid paying bad WLB\n- Moved Browserstack from Unknown WLB to Remote First\n- Moved Rippling from Unknown WLB to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Zepto to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added SAP Labs to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved ServiceNow from Unknown WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Moved RedHat from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Good WLB\n- Moved Cred from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Bad WLB\n- Added MathWorks to Good Paying Good WLB\n- Added Akamai to Remote First\n- Added MasterCard to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Smallcase to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved BigBasket from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Grab from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Moved Gojek from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Added HashedIn to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Walmart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Flipkart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Zeta to Mid Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Phonepe to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Zerodha from the list\n- Added Autodesk to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Unacademy from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Agoda Bangkok to Visa Sponsorship outside US\n- Added Zoho to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Freshworks to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Atlassian from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Directi from high paying Unknown WLB to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Datadog from Remote first to mid paying good WLB\n- Added Confluent to Remote first ","1849":"Hey devs, does anybody here have idea about how much zepto offers for devops role?\n\nI have cleared all technical rounds and got to know the compensation from hr but it seems like i am getting lowballed so, just wanted to see.","1850":"Hi guys, I created an app [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) where you can compare prices of multiple products available on platforms like Instamart, Blinkit, Bigbasket Zepto.\nMore platforms will be added soon.\n\nFeedbacks and reviews are welcome. \ud83d\ude05\nWeb version will be available if I get positive feedback!\n\n[Download from playstore!](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly)\n\nP.S\nAn improvement which I am not considering anytime soon is showing all prices of all platforms under single product items.\nBut I feels current UX handles it upto an extent.","1851":"I have an offer from Zepto.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","1859":"Hey all\nI am currently between jobs and i have 2 offers and have to decide in 2 days.

Dunzo\u2019s annual expenditure and losses closely tracked revenue growth to bloat 2X to Rs 532 crore and Rs 464 crore respectively in FY22.\n\nComing to ratios, EBITDA margin and ROCE are registered at -645.64% and -31.95%.

And if you go through the comments carefully you will see that Varun calls the general crowd over here as Reddit ke Gawaar and what not. He comes at everyone with a vengeance as he is just too crass and insecure himself. \nJust by selling some perfumes he feels he is some Perfume God or something. Even today he commented on something he is not aware of as if the OP is lying. \n\nSee - Screen shot\n\nOther Links here \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/YEoTvBCDTn\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/5GHABxonRF\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/2BMgR1AZLm\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/jz8KuZEw0A\n\n\nImagine spending your hard earned money on buying from such people and then being subjected to abuses and name calling and personal attacks if you were to raise any query to them. \nTheir high handedness in resolving any issue is to be seen firsthand. \nJust by saying we have this certificate and we are this and that does not automatically absolve them. They feel they are too big to give any clarifications to anyone. \nHe couldnt give any proofs immediately but yes later on after being called out he will dig high and low and come up with something after begging on his other groups. \nWell in this it was a case of different packaging which I have anyways mentioned in the post but going to the extent of targeting someone\u2019s family is uncalled for. \nHe called me Buddha, Buddhe, Darpok, Chacha and mentally unstable and even going to the extent of targeting my family and  what not. As if being 40 (considered old in his dictionary) takes anything away from me. I have achieved a lot of my dreams already and yet I\u2019m still young at heart \ud83d\ude02\nBuddha hoga uska baap. \n\nSomeone even told me that he wrote in the DFA chit chat group ke \u201cyeh aaj marega mere haato\u201d. What a sick man seriously!!!\nAnd to those who enjoy his lovely behaviour let me tell you this, your time will also come sooner or later. \n\nOthers, who have been at the receiving end of his unruly behaviour, now is the time to speak up if you want, or suffer in silence and forever hold your peace. \n\nIn the update Link of my post I exactly proved my point about the attitude of such sellers who are worse in behaviour than a road side chappri. He actually completely exposed himself in trying to be oh so cool and even some of his own supporters didn\u2019t like the way he presented himself. Think about it, there is not a single seller here who behaves in such a condescending manner. \nThe original post was due to the worry of some guy who had bought the Khamrah from Talib but Talib being the gentleman that he is,  he never once commented anything adverse on that OPs post.  \n\nYes , everyone can buy retail phir tum jaiso ki dukaan hi bandh ho jayegi. \nAajkal itti itti thaeliyo me bhi Ajmal Silver Shade milne laga hai Zepto aur Blinkit par \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd when there are many other reliable sellers still existing on this sub, you people (buyers) should be the best judge to decide whom to buy from if u don\u2019t want unwanted hassles. \n\nAnd to those saying how can there be fakes of clones, sorry to burst your bubble but they are there and in large numbers already. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fragrancedeals\/s\/GWA47NbFfu\n\nLet me also add here that he sold Kaaf and Fattan at unbelievably low rates some time back and then (I would not say many), but some of the people did complain about watered down versions, sharp,  shrill, chemically pungent smells which must have been brushed off as bad batches or package change or whatever else.  So don\u2019t fall for his low price best offer tricks. \n\nThanks to a few of the gems from this sub for reaching out to me personally and feeling concerned about this guys obnoxious behaviour. Really appreciated and I will keep your identity safe as understand no one wants undue attention \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb \nJust that U thought about me makes me feel immense gratitude towards U. \n\nNow coming to the most important question here: Why are there no basic rules or guidelines for not making personal attacks on anyone by the mods. Why can\u2019t such egoistic clowns be barred from the community or warned to maintain decorum as is the norm in other subs on Reddit?\n\nIf general people like you and me would have degraded someone like this, then we would be kicked out the next minute. \nWhy this soft corner for this kind of rowdy sellers. Is this what this group has come to now?\n\nWhy are Mods lenient with such kind of sellers? KBC question !\n\nA) Mods don\u2019t care two hoots\nB) Mods (atleast some of them) are  his customers\nC) Mods are way too neutral to be disturbed by anything \nD) Mods are like \ud83c\udf7fkhao mast ho jao\n\nMalkeet Narula ko toa ek second me ban kar diya tha. Not that I\u2019m saying he was the best here. There are still many other sellers who are very polite and very genuine. \n\nAnyway end of rant. Nothing else left to say \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Uall be the best judge and keep this sub as it was intended to be in the first place imparting knowledge about fragrances and \nNot as some harem of shady sellers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","2045":"1. Zara Silver EDT: A fresh, clean scent with citrusy top notes and a woody base. Perfect for everyday wear.\n\n2. Zara Gold EDT: My all-time favorite!

Ajmal Zeal: A vibrant, energetic fragrance with a blend of fruity and floral notes.\n\n4. Garden of Mirror by Miniso: A mysterious, enchanting fragrance with floral and woody notes.\n\n5. Al Dirgham by Ard Al Zafran: A strong, bold fragrance with a rich, spicy character.\n\n6. Ahmed Leather (2ml tester): A leathery, woody fragrance with a touch of sweetness.

Qaed Al Fursan: A powerful, masculine fragrance with a strong oud note. Dominated by pineapple through out and very pleasing!\n\n11. Ajmal Silver Shade: A long-lasting scent with a metallic note that can be overpowering for some. Despite the headache-inducing metallic note, I couldn\u2019t resist buying another bottle at a steal of a deal on Zepto.\n\n12. Supremacy Not Only Intense: A strong, long-lasting fragrance that\u2019s a popular clone of Creed Aventus. While it performs well, it\u2019s not my personal favorite.\n\n13. Maison Alhambra Toscano Leather: A high-quality, long-lasting leather fragrance that\u2019s a great alternative to more expensive options. It\u2019s very similar to Ahmed Leather, but more affordable and performs equally well.\n\nThere are couple of fragrance which I own but not the photograph: \n\n14.

During that time if she gets a heart attack or any other issue, I'm worried  no one will be there to sound the alarm. \n\nShe's 52 yrs old, around 5'1 but her weight is around 100kg. BMI wise, it's not good and I see that it affects her as well.  She gets winded by the most basic exercise like climbing the stairs to the terrace. With Zepto, she doesn't even go out of the house except for her monthly kitty and maybe any work related to my sisters studies. She takes pills for high BP and is probably avoiding doing the health checkup that my parents used to do once every year( but haven't done in awhile) They always tell her to reduce weight because she is 30kgs overweight but I think she doesn't know where to start. She doesn't have any health issues at the moment, but I'm worried they will start soon because of her weight. \n\nShe is worried about her parents(my grandparents) heath, who are healthy with some diabetes and heart issues and are getting old(around 70s). They might move in once I leave but they give her too much stress regarding her weight by pointing it out a lot. \n\nI want to help her improve her lifestyle before I leave. I have the time to make some changes. What would you suggest?\n\nMy motivations are selfish in some sense. I want her to live a long life, to enjoy the fruits of my success one day.

There are so many things that simply require too much effort from the user.\n\n1. **UI:** Their UI is so complex and confusing that I often get lost in the app. Maybe it is a part of their strategy to make user spend more time on their app or there is some psychology level hack to it, I don't know but it is crazy.\n2. **Confusing features:** I want to order groceries, not give an aptitude test                               \nOne of the biggest problems is that you want to order a product for tomorrow but it ends up starting an everyday delivery is a pain. Even to figure out how to stop it is a pain in itself. The experience can simply be like the other apps that are there in the market. Zepto, Blinkit,   \n Instamart and even Milkbasket have such a simple and easy to use UI. \n3. **Out of Stock or out of sense:** There is a reason I am ordering groceries a day in advance because i wan to avoid all the last minute pain and hassle but they do the exact opposite. The app will take your order but deliver half of the next morning with a rationale that things were out of stock. Now it's your job to panic and arrange groceries at 7 AM in the morning. \n\nI understand that they send the good stuff but the dread of opening the app everyday because I can't avoid is just too much and hence I think its better to rely on some other apps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWriting this because any successful service based business has become good on the back of feedback that It received from their customers and I genuinely hope that their PM gets a chance to read this rant.","2835":"Was indifferent at the start when Zepto arrived in Kochi and then they offered their \"pass\" at a few bucks. Worth a try, right? The rates were unbeatable. Their little brown bags were cute too till I had a pile of it here ('I don't need a bag' enabled) I found myself buying all groceries from them. Super quick deliveries. \n\nTime for renewal of membership. Still some bucks (, though technically it had tripled now, I think) Prices were still low, but higher than earlier. Deliveries still fast but slower than earlier. The app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here (not what you want to learn from your competition. Looking at you Swiggy!) still good.\n\nNow, they've gotten really sneaky with their pricing. A few things are still on discounted rates but most aren't. But the real sneaky part is where they don't show the split of the prices anymore. You need to go look for it. And here's the best part, you need to now enable free delivery. Sneaky buggers. Guess much like the other delivery apps, this too will be just another option. \n\nDon't know if they would be able to sustain. What are your thoughts and experiences with the app?

They really need customers to come in numbers and buy a lot. It has a positive outlook from growths perspective because it's India's walmart. \n\nHowever, we live in a different time from when walmart grew. You can order anything from the comfort of your home. It's not all that entertaining to shop physically. Transportation, carrying around the cart, billing are tiring. \n\nSo do companies like DMart, Medplus and Reliance Retail have much growth potential?","2875":"Se here at the key factors of my Analysis of Dmart\n\nNon-Food Business Segments:Upon reviewing DMart's latest investor presentation, I observed that their non-food segments contribute 47% to their overall revenue. It's commonly understood that retailers generally enjoy higher margins in the non-food segment compared to food. However, I'm uncertain about whether DMart's current strategy and performance in this segment are aligned with sustainable growth and profitability. The management has indicated that DMart focuses more on providing casual and home wear rather than party wear. So I was thinking to wait to invest in Dmart till the company figures out their non food segment strategy.\n\nRevenue Per Square Meter and Ecommerce Enhancement:Despite DMart's revenue per square meter remaining below pre-COVID levels, I believe there's significant growth potential, especially through the enhancement of their ecommerce capabilities. With competitors like JioMart in the market, and decrease in Revenue per sq mtr I think it's vital to look for enhancing their ecommerce game. The recent con-calls highlighted plans to reduce delivery time and increase basket size without adopting Zepto's business model. I'm curious about the feasibility and potential impact of these initiatives and would appreciate your insights.\n\nSame Store Sales Growth (SSSG):DMart's declining same store sales growth, from 41.6% in H1\/FY 23 to 8.6% in H1\/FY 24, raises concerns about their operational strategies and market positioning. \n\nSo i just wanted to know what points am I missing in my analysis and would highly appreciate your insights on my analysis.","2899":"Hindi ad right in front of Kannada flags.

This could be across India, but I'm seeing it already here in Bengaluru where lots of people order groceries. Even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs. 599 which isn't something I'll be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase. Seems to me that if this starts making them enough money, other apps will follow. Zepto is currently the only one without big backing - blinkit has zomato, bigbasket has tata, instamart has swiggy, and milkbasket has reliance, and they're facing difficulty in getting funding, but seems to me like I'd rather go to a grocery store now, where I can get better discounts, which I've been doing since they've started rolling this out. \n\nIs it just me?

These students took their online assessments from their rooms, using AI tools and the internet, while the rest of us were stuck in the labs under strict supervision. During their interviews,\u00a0**someone sat next to them, googling the answers to the interviewer's questions**. They didn\u2019t earn their offers honestly. Even worse, they helped their friends do the same, landing jobs they didn\u2019t deserve.\n2. **Lying to Companies:**\u00a0In August, the Placement Cell\u00a0**lied to nearly all the 40+ companies**, telling them they were the\u00a0**first ones coming to campus**\u00a0for recruitment. For example, when Zepto visited, they were told they were the first company on campus, but companies like Meesho, Google, Zomato etc. had already been here. This kind of deception shows how poorly things are run.\n3. **Ongoing Cheating and Multiple Offers:**\u00a0The cheating didn\u2019t stop there. Members of the Placement Cell\u00a0**are still cheating**\u00a0during the current placement season. Many of them are holding\u00a0**multiple job offers**, which is a clear violation of the college\u2019s code of conduct. Those involved include\u00a0**Aditya Sharma (overall placement coordinator), Anant Sharma and Manas Gupta**.\n4. **Dr. Muneendra Ojha Enables It All:**\u00a0The worst part? This blatant abuse of power is being allowed by\u00a0**Dr Muneendra Ojha**, the Training and Placement Coordinator. His job is to make sure everyone follows the rules, but instead, he\u2019s turning a blind eye to all this cheating and lying. Why? Because all he cares about is the final placement statistics.

(Yes, I am not kidding scroll through the post and you will get it)\n\n  \n  \nfirst of all, if you want to get serious in life. I have a life-changing opportunity for you\n\nOnly condition is: are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent? \n\n\n\nThis post could be the life changing for you. (might be long)\n\n\n\nTo give you some context, \n\nI am an integral part of an amazing startup (I won't name it here, but I can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn) to give you a brief idea about us, we are a delivery startup \n\nYou might think, \"bUt bRoO, tHeRE are already Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, in tHE sAmE business then what are you doing different \" but let me tell you, we have a completely different USP and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like Zomato & Swiggy. And even if they tried to copy us in the future, it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nEnough about our startup. Now, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s relevant to you.\n\n  \nFor our startup, we are building our app. We have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns. We recently secured funding and are looking to scale. We\u2019ve built Version 1 \n\nand launched it on the App Store and Play Store. We\u2019re now working on Version 2, and for that, we\u2019re looking for interns with experience in native app development. Don\u2019t close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development; bear with me, I have something for you :)\n\n\n\nJust let me clear it here : we don't give a single fuck about your CGPA. Excellence is what we are looking for. \n\n\n\nbut before starting out, I want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired. \n\n \n\n3 months ago, we hired 2 interns from one of the top college, both were girls. One had an impressive CV with crazy projects, languages, and all that, while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance, promising she wouldn\u2019t disappoint us. We hired both, and even while they were learning, we started their stipend. (how we searched for them? we circulated msg's on their whatsapp college groups) However, we noticed that the girl with the great CV was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it (Like literal laughable excuses) She was doing all the mediocre work nothing special, just the bare minimum(sometimes not even bare minimum) with delayed submissions and all.  \n   \nIn startups, things move fast, and you have to learn quickly and adapt. She wasn\u2019t doing that, but on top of that, she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend. On the other hand, the second girl, who asked for a chance, did extremely well.\n\n She put in the effort and did what was expected, staying on top of her tasks.\n\nA week ago, the first girl with the great CV sent us a message saying she couldn\u2019t continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for GATE at IIT. (It was all lie, like as usual) and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work. This whole situation was a lie. How did I know? Because previously she added me on LinkedIn, and yesterday, I saw her comment under a LinkedIn post asking for another internship, attaching her CV\n\n\n\nI won\u2019t comment further on her, but put yourself in my shoes. Imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return.\n\n\n\nSo, this is the exact type of person we don\u2019t want to hire. We really don\u2019t want any \u201cinternship farmers\u201d who aim to do 5-6 internships just to make their CVs shinner than the moon itself. \n\nIf that\u2019s your goal, we\u2019re not interested.\n\n\n\nWhat we want?\n\n\n\nWe want some smart Individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life. This doesn\u2019t have to be a project; we don\u2019t want another CV decorator who just wants to paint their dry CV with some internships. We want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return. \n\n\n\nThis is a paid internship.   \n\n\nPreviously, we offered no-conditions paid internships, but because of our past experience, we just don't want to burn our money.\n\n\n\nIf you reading this, you fall under 2 categories :\n\n\n\nKnows about Native app development :\n\nwe\u2019ll assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week. If you complete it within the timeframe, we\u2019ll start your stipend.\n\n\n\nDoesn't know about app development :\n\nEven if you don\u2019t know anything about app development, but you\u2019re a determined individual who wants to achieve something, then you are welcome in our startup.\n\nWe are ready to invest in you. working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach you.Within a year of working with a startup, you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nFor Learning, we\u2019ll first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 3-4 days. If you show that you\u2019re a smart, quick learner, we\u2019ll start your stipend. \n\nThis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis opportunity is open to everyone, even if you\u2019ve just started your first year of college. Doesn't matter. We\u2019re looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work.\n\n\n\nFuture plans :\n\n\n\nIf you stick with us: We\u2019ll continue paying your stipend, and once we have full confidence in your work after 4-6 months, we\u2019ll hire you directly. Within a year, you could be earning at least \n\n10 LPA, and if you show extraordinary skills, 15 LPA. I Know, Offering this package during this period of time of recession is rare, but we\u2019re committed.\n\n\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ready to join us, feel free to DM me.

If you're talking about quality, you'll sometimes fave the same issues when your kirana or veggie vendor also deliver.\n\nThis post may sound like I'm a huge proponent of Zepto. I'm not.

This higher margins on the same product is at the offset cost of 1) higher delivery cost 2) higher CAC 3) higher operating cost for that order. Most customers ordering on quick commerce apps are perfectly happy to pay this premium as long as it means they get convenience and instant delivery.On the other hand, Dmart target audience is customers who are slightly budget conscious. They prefer to plan their purchases and do on bulk in a monthly\/bimonthly basis. For this segment the price is higher weightage than convenience.

A mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person. \nTimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade. \nPeople are now accepting Entrepreneurship is something in India but still we have a long way to go.","India is kind of late to the technology scene. I remember, in 1997-1998 there used to be to 1-2 computer hardware shops in Nehru Place. While in US, dotcom scene was so booming, which eventually led to the bubble in 2000. We were so far apart. \n\nYou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 10-20 years. Our startup scene only started in around 2007. It takes a good 10-15 years to build a solid foundation. Yes, we lag behind & will continue to lag behind USA but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less.

It fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy, often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class. Zomato, Byju's, and Swiggy are classic examples.\n\nPerhaps a more sustainable approach would be for India to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets. As Peter Thiel emphasizes in his book \"Zero to One,\" true startups should focus on creating something entirely new, not just replicating existing models. Zoho and Zerodha are commendable examples of Indian companies that have done just that.\n\nIndia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, with a higher proportion of self-employed individuals than perhaps any other nation (except maybe China). Government and investors should have prioritized established, homegrown successes like Naga Mills, Haldirams, and Everest. These companies, admired internationally for filling genuine gaps, represent India's true entrepreneurial strength. Instead, the focus seems to be on loss-making ventures like Ola and Swiggy, businesses arguably unsuited to the Indian market's current needs. \n\nPerhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging India is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population. By fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs, India can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, not just a select few.\n\nY'all stop being copy cats...","It's a structural change that's needed.

So I had booked a cab and the guy had accepted my ride but hers hadn't ended right.

So I sat down next to her and we drive a little extra to drop her at the gate she wanted. Then she didn't have that option where Uber automatically deducts your cab fare, so she asked the guy for scanner and pretended to make the payment. She said payment ho gaya before getting down, the cab driver nodded and she went inside. There was no tingtingtiding sound but I thought her phone could be on silent. Also, if I'm ever paying like this, I always show my phone screen to whom I'm making the payment so they can double check.\u00a0When we have gone further the guy says amount toh abhi tak aaya nahi and I was like tab kyun nahi bola, baad mein thodi aata hai, immediate transfer hota. He was like mere ko online nahi samajhta, har din do teen log toh free ride le lete hai.

It was in March last year; I was on my way to my workplace which was barely 3kms from my place at that time. Since it was around 8:15AM in HSR, there was no traffic. Just off of signal, I was on around 50kmph on my bike. There comes a Zepto pickup store or whatever they call it. A delivery guy had just left from there on Yulu, exactly on the extreme left. So, I didn\u2019t slow down my bike as there was a huge gap and I kept 50kmph and I was riding near the center line on road. Suddenly the Zepto delivery guy decides to start zigzagging on Yulu, comes in my way and we crash. Since he was on Yulu, he just fell down but my bike took a lot of beating and so did I. At that time I had purchased new riding jacket so I used to wear it all the time along with gloves but that specific day, it was warm so I ditched both jacket and gloves and just had my SMK helmet on.

Because VCs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden. Quick refunds, more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup.\n\nMany VCs now know that the market size for these services in India is small. So, VC funding is drying up. To remain alive these companies now need to become profitable. For that they need to try and extract that marginal cost. This can be through:\n\n1. Smaller fleets to reduce cost. This causes delivery times to go up.\n2. Bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size. This again causes delivery times to go up.\n3. Asking extra money if bunching isn't opted by customers.\n4. Saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons. This causes customer support quality to go down. Extra checks on claims, asking for pics, emails etc.\n5. Increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue.\n6. Hiking prices on subscriptions. Because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service. It is counter intuitive but true.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies. I use Swiggy and Bbinstant a lot.

Why is Instacart doing so well in the US?","That's an interesting viewpoint! Services like Blinkit and Zepto, which have done so well in the Indian market, are characterized by convenience, rising urbanization, and the need to save time among the target urban populace. Heavy discounts, paired with rapid delivery, appeal to the instant gratification requirement that is common in densely populated areas.\n\n\n\nSure, countries with lower income inequalities frequently have fewer people who want to isolate themselves from the larger population, and such demand services may not be readily available in other countries. However, in India, with a growing middle class and social stratification outside of most urban areas, such on-demand services are useful for users who can afford the handy choice.","Or, you know, it\u2019s because there is no place to park at stores, no footpaths to walk there, no roads to take your car, autos will charge you more than your monthly grocery bill for a distance of 1 km, taxis are never available, store owners treat you like trash and try to cheat you, you are looked at like a thief by the security guard, you are looked at with judgement by the cashier and other people wandering around the store based on what you buy, and overall given a terrible experience if you even think of going to a real store.

However, work-life balance (WLB) can be quite debatable, even within the same company\u2014it varies by division and team. Ultimately, it depends on your manager.\n\nFor example, I worked at a company where my team had excellent WLB. We didn\u2019t have to take late-night calls with our U.S. counterparts or work weekends. Meanwhile, another team right next to us, working on a different project, often had late-night calls and occasionally worked weekends.","Death due to work - All Big 4 !!","Flipkart good WLB \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","Adobe is a joke.

Some teams in Amazon would have excellent wlb while some teams in Microsoft would have terrible wlb. It depends on the team culture and the culture that the managers want to promote.\n\nWhat I have seen is some managers who move from a place where there is cutthroat culture to a place where wlb and culture is valued, they bring that culture with them and things start going south. Pretty recent example is Atlassian where many people from Meta moved into senior leaderships and now you know the result.\n\nThis makes me anxious when trying to switch companies thinking what if the place where I go to turns out toxic as hell.

Being a low-income country, folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too in-disciplined to adopt productivity apps (let alone pay subscription fees for them!). Furthermore, if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is - people spend hours in local trains & buses. It is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments (Instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports, betting apps, etc. looking for instant gratification or 'quick' money). Neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps.\n\nTo summarize: Low-income population + Indiscipline + Poor public transportation\/infrastructure --> Instant gratification apps (such as betting, gaming apps).","[deleted]"],"1882":[">Namaste!\nThanks for submitting to r\/developersIndia.

The metaverse which Meta seems to be too indulged in would presumably be snatched by either a giant like Apple, MSFT, nvidia (checkout their vision) or some decentralised metaworld like decentraland. Although the world would never fall short of surprises I still would have my bias against Facebook in long term.

I had hoped to see some constructive reviews and meaningful experiences today, being Sunday. Unfortunately, yet again, we\u2019re met with another Alibaba vs Varun debate. Allow me to clarify several points for you and for the community at large:\n\n1.\tRegarding the authenticity of the perfume: \n\nWas the perfume fake? NO. Were you scammed? NO. All accusations regarding the bottle\u2019s authenticity were thoroughly addressed, and you yourself acknowledged that it was indeed a legitimate product.\n\n2.\tSeller verification on the DFA subreddit:\n\n\t\u2022\tNo seller is officially verified or labeled as \u201ctrusted\u201d by the DFA moderation team.\n\t\u2022\tThe rules clearly state that we do not maintain a list of verified sellers, nor do we endorse or authenticate any sellers or their stock.\n\t\u2022\tAny lists shared within the subreddit are community-driven, created by members to provide a general understanding of grey-market sellers. These are not officially backed or endorsed by DFA in any capacity.\n\n3.\tYour transaction and its aftermath:\n\n\t\u2022\tYour deal was conducted outside the subreddit, and your disputes with the seller also occurred outside the subreddit. This makes it a private matter between you and the seller.\n\t\u2022\tDespite this, you have attempted to involve the moderators, questioning why we haven\u2019t taken action against the seller for their offensive language. However, I\u2019ve observed inflammatory remarks from both sides in this case. Additionally, comments such as \u201cMods ke friends hoge sellers\u201d are baseless and inappropriate.\n\n4.\tActions taken by the moderators:\n\n\t\u2022\tA stern warning was issued to the seller regarding their use of abusive language, with the explicit consequence of a ban for any further violations.\n\t\u2022\tSince this warning, we have not encountered any hateful or abusive comments from the seller\u2019s side.\n\n5.\tRepetitive nature of your posts:\n\n\t\u2022\tThis is now the third or fourth post regarding the same incident, which occurred months ago. Rehashing the event repeatedly and turning every weekly thread into a rant adds no value to the community.\n\n6.\tUnacceptable behavior from both sides:\n\n\t\u2022\tWhile I agree that the seller\u2019s language was inappropriate, your own words were equally unacceptable. Disputes and arguments should be confined to private messages. Bringing these disputes into the public forum, engaging in mutual abuse, and then blaming the moderators for inaction displays a flawed understanding of our role.\n\n7.\tConclusion:\n\n\t\u2022\tThere is no evidence of a scam, no sale of fake products, and no history of fraudulent or unfulfilled orders involving this seller. As such, a ban is unwarranted.\n\n\t\u2022\tHowever, abusive or threatening behavior will not be tolerated. The issue was addressed, and corrective action was taken when the seller was warned. Since then, no further issues have arisen.\n\t\u2022\tConstantly revisiting the matter and creating unnecessary drama benefits no one.\n\t\n8.\tFinal clarification:\n\n\t\u2022\tDFA does not maintain any verified or trusted seller list. All purchases are at your own discretion and risk.\n\t\u2022\tThe moderation team does not guarantee the behavior, professionalism, language use, nature, personality or stock authenticity of any seller. If you value peace of mind, it\u2019s advisable to stick to retail purchases.\n\nI hope this clears up any misunderstandings. Let\u2019s keep this subreddit constructive and focused on our shared passion for fragrances.","Irrespective of what has happened, no one has the right to abuse anyone. It seems like the mods here are biased towards sellers. Sellers hold more influence in the groups, which might be why this happens. The same applies to Facebook groups like FMI. Moderators should address misbehavior and permanently block those who act inappropriately. Let this group thrive without bias. Peace out!","wtf is this pathetic language \"Teri idhr bhi Marana chalu karu\" ??\n\n  \nwho the hell is this seller? Can someone please tell him he can't talk to us the way he talks to his mother and father?","It would he a private matter if the comments were made privately to OP not in a public chat box.","\"Marna chalu Karu kya\"\nNo wonder it's 'Mom' perfumes.

This is GD Prasad, founder of VS Mani & Co. Really sorry about what's happened here.   \n  \nWe recently launched our No Palm Oil version of our Potato Chips and also sent stock to all Quick Commerce dark stores. It's likely that the dark store has had some stock of our previous batch (which is fried in Palm Oil) and they may have wrongly sent you the old pack instead of the new one, as shown in the pic on the app. I believe there's our fault here as well - that the packs are very similar looking, so we can't necessarily blame the dark store employee for this.\n\nI have attached an image that should help clarify this.\n\nThe new pack is fried in Rice Bran Oil and has the call out of NO PALM OIL on the front of the pack and has Rice Bran Oil mentioned in the back of pack ingredients section. The old pack has no such call outs. You should have received the new pack (the one on the right as per my image attached here). However, you have recd. the old one (the one on the left as per my image).\n\nTruly sorry about this - we may have to engage with our channel partners to see how the old stock can be removed from the dark stores to prevent such confusion and mistakes.\n\nKindly email me your address to contact@vsmani.com. I would like to send you packs of our Rice Bran Oil fried Potato Chips. Thank you for bringing this to our notice.\n\nThank you and sorry about this.\n\nGD Prasad  \nFounder, VS Mani & Co.","Good case for compensation","https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1tv7xtqery3e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06d4488f5fe680aa4c105c066e05c3a60776ff0d\n\nEven if you drop a complaint,  point number 8.2 in their Terms of Use will make sure they won't get into trouble and show it as if it's your fault","Has happened to me on Blinkit too.

I can suggest 2 options - which will not require upfront capital, but may take up time:\n\n1. Sales, check shops and marketplace events(common ones are 3 days exhibitions happening every weekend in city) looking for contract sales, these can go for a month of contract or for 3 days. Your job would be to pitch in as a sales partner for the event, bring in traffic (plus if you are local) and charge by 3 hour shifts. This would require study about the material available and interest in answering questions or queries to guide users to spend. Mostly by end of day 1 in events you will come to know the target shops, and work in commission of daily sales not the upfront amount directly. Study about fashion, jewellery, tech, gadgets, is minimal and repetitive. Worst case you get 2500 , try to target atleast 3 such host places.\n\n\n2. Travel\/food guide - Target  4 star hotels  having international tourists, hospitality industry is always on the lookout for young English speakers that can captivate and share information about local places and explain clearly on history, traditions, popular joints. This requires a bit of study and practice which you need to present to the hotel reception staff \/travel desk dedicated to guides. Research and find these places where you see a external vendor handling travel tourism for hotel guests.  There is always a low roll on these in peak times, but would require most of your time and outcome would be 20k net after full month of roaming and studying about places found in internet\/known already but presented well. Difficult part would be to get started as this would require a lot of effort and research in right places."],"2211":["Sony center paradise","I checked in Croma yesterday AMB mall 54k","Near koti","Never buy costly items from online markets, buy them physically by visiting shops even though 500-1000rps costly....","Vijaysales reliance","Zepto","Ambrit games, koti.

I think quick commerce will kill the small kirana stores because these stores don't provide discounts. Instead of going to a nearby kirana shop and paying the mrp, people will use quick commerce and get things home delivered.","The quality of vegetables that I receive in swiggy instamart are a gamble. But I don't see good products in SmartBazaar either! But KPN is different though. They keep a stock of fresh vegetables and fruits.\u00a0","Grace supermarket is expanding in Chennai. Not sure how they are doing it though.\u00a0","Let the QCommerce folks run out of funds, which will happen in another few months. Zepto alone is burning 250 crores a month so discounts are there for order value of 799+\n\nBlinkit, Big Basket etc are biding their time while Zepto runs out of money.\n\nRetail is not going anywhere, especially in Chennai as it's not just about consumption but also trust, culture, and stepping out of the house. Chennai isn't exactly like other metros, where going out of the house is not something people look forward to. The overall experience is still an important factor with a largely lower-middle-class consumer base.","I genuinely hope the Quick-Commerce industry endures and isn\u2019t frequently threatened by the rent-seeking behavior of kirana stores.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised when e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart entered the market. Retailers cried foul, and this resistance was part of the reason multi-brand retail remains restricted under India\u2019s foreign direct investment policy. However, the reality is that platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have created more jobs and made our lives easier. \n\nWalmart, for instance, was eager to enter India and successfully did so through Flipkart, which is now Walmart\u2019s subsidiary in the country. Even if the government were to impose stricter regulations on the Quick-Commerce sector tomorrow, I think the industry would find ways to adapt and thrive similar to what Walmart did with Flipkart. \n\nFun fact: Multi-brand retailing isn\u2019t allowed in India for foreign investment but single-brand retailing is. Yet, you\u2019ll see Decathlon, which technically operates as a multi-brand retailer since they have different sub-brands for each sport\u2014like swimming, cycles, or cricket. So, how are they allowed to do business in India?\n\nThe government recognized the issue and so, as long as the sub-brands fall under the umbrella of the main brand, it\u2019s still considered single-brand retail. That\u2019s how Decathlon manages to operate in India. It\u2019s a bit of legalese and grey area, so I won\u2019t go too deep, but there will always be workarounds. \n\nI am not a big fan of bashing private equity and venture capitalist folks and platforms like Blinkit, Instamart, and Zepto are backed by investors who understand the market and know what they are doing. \n\nThe government, too, seems to recognize the importance of this industry. While they might introduce regulations\u2014similar to how cab aggregators were required to obtain licenses from the motor vehicles department or comply with caps on surge pricing\u2014it\u2019s unlikely they would attempt to dismantle the sector entirely. At least, I hope that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nThese disruptions are a natural part of capitalism. They may bring challenges, but they also create new opportunities, generate jobs, and improve convenience for consumers. The same logic applies to technological disruptions like Uber and Ola. Yes, cab drivers raised valid concerns, and there are real issues to address. But these platforms are not inherently bad. In fact, they\u2019ve spurred competition from alternatives like Namma Yatri or RedTaxi in Coimbatore. \n\nThis cycle of change is comparable to how typewriters gave way to computers, or how digitization has replaced physical files. Complaining about these shifts is like worrying that digitization will destroy the paper industry. This is the essence of the creative destruction that drives capitalism, and instead of resisting it we will have to embrace it. Watching some Vijay movie explaining communism using idlis or some corporate conspiracy theme having Jagapati Babu or some vadak actor as villain isn\u2019t going to help anyone.\n\nSide note: It was raining heavily, and my clothes weren\u2019t drying. I ran out of jatti for office and ended up ordering them from Blinkit. Honestly, I can\u2019t thank Blinkit enough for saving the day!\n\nMy personal rule is simple: if something makes my life easier, I\u2019m all for it\u2014whether it\u2019s artificial intelligence, e-commerce, quick commerce, working from home, or traveling by the metro.","Dude Reliance is setting up ipo for Reliance retail for books to look good they are closing stores. Don't be misguided. Reliance is never innovative. They enter after the market is mature and drive out competition by politics. \n\nReliance Digital competitor is Chroma\n\nReliance Jio Mart competition is Amazon Retail.  They are clear like they don't want touch grounds of DMart internal understanding... \n\nReliance had set online Jio store, no word how's it's going for now. But thing is they have shops in almost all area in main spot. So if area develops their business in that area booms. \n\nDMart competition is only Saravana Stores in India, It's a copy of Wal-Mart. In saravana you get items of all sizes,  that option is not there in DMart. But saravanna is not much into consumables they just have a floor for it. But DMart's competition is every other store in city. Being a 3Lcr market capital, salary is 10k per month you can see board outside their stores. \n\nProblem with old style stores is they haven't renovated like they didn't even paint the shop for years. It's dark, very dark and dirty.  Now a days people like to see everything bright with tubelight. \n\nRise in apartments encourages, delivery partners so that industry will be boom.Zepto, swiggy, zomato, blinking, big basket.\n\nPeople like to go out otherwise every other food influencers business will fail.

There is logging upto knee levels in many places. \n\n>Its been common to have cyclone every year like how it is common in odisha\n\nYes, but cyclones are a natural phenomenon. We can't do anything about it, right? The weather patterns in November-December facilitate their formation. It's not possible to curb them.\n\nWhat you probably mean is reducing their impact on people, on infrastructure etc. Yeah, many things could be improved. There are some structural issues which have no straight forward solution - buildings on top of water bodies, blocking natural drainage flow of water, building multiple layers of road on top without scraping them resulting in constantly increasing road height etc.\n\nDisaster preparedness is something we have to definitely get better at. Reducing the vulnerability - socially, economically and physically should be prioritised. Loss of livelihood of people, presence of weaker buildings with building codes violated or worked around, sorry state of affairs of slum dwellers etc. As long as the underlying issue is not addressed, even the best of mitigation efforts are not sustainable in the long term. \n\nOdisha has community-led disaster management, cyclone shelters, embankments, early warning systems etc and have created a very resilient ecosystem which we should aspire to emulate.

The difference is most of them are B2B and go into Ycombinator and get different levels of funding instead of going through IPO etc in india. B2B is much more profitable then B2C for small startups. I think you should do more research...","Fun fact - a founder friend of mine applied to shark tank.

I feel we just have a handful of VCs who are based out of TN.\n\nWe can definitely do better in all these fronts.","Check out the Start Genome report on various startup ecosystems around the world. Chennai's ecosystem is minuscule and yet across the globe, there are lots of people from Tamil\/TN backgrounds in this industry globally.  So, I don't think that it is some sort of lack of talent but I think there is a massive cultural issue in that risk-taking seems to be frowned upon and it is a real pet peeve of mine.   \n\n\nSecondly, as a city, Chennai lags far behind the other major start-up hubs in terms of the social infrastructure required to build a start-up ecosystem. Look up the world's major start-up cities and they are all highly liberal. The morons in our city seem to think that this means that we need to have a lot of pubs and bars, but that's not the point. It is more a case of having an environment that allows intellectual curiosity to flourish, an openness to outsiders, and a willingness to live and let live. As someone from a fairly standard middle-class\/upper-middle-class family, I think this is hugely lacking in Chennai compared to our peers like Bangalore etc. If I remember correctly, the total ecosystem value of Chennai was around $11b while Bangalore's ecosystem was valued at $168b. This will inevitably lead to talent drain and momentum, while other cities will wither and wane.   \n\n\nHopefully, the new government will try to arrest this and it looks like they're trying to do that somewhat with some of the recent start-up discussion panels with notable economists like Arvind Subramanium and Raghuram Rajan coming to Chennai. Without some drastic action and soon, the city will be left in the dust.","Well, if you count new briyani shops and Real estate companies as startups, we far out number em. There are many more in IT who constantly compares what companies pay and whats the market value of inherited land and wants to de-evolve back to farming so that they retain control of inheritance wealth.

They raise very slow, don't depend on huge funding from outside, usually depending on in-house fund generation from other services.

Any food you eat has sugar in it anyway. \n\nSo when you compare with your overall calorie intake per day (assuming it's around 1500 to 2000 calories), few tea spoons of sugar is a negligible amount.

First of all cute username! I am the skin care girly and I will try my best to help you. You've mentioned that you want to try niacinamide. Minimalist is a good brand for beginners since it doesn't do any harm. Might take longer to work but I started with minimalist and I'm glad that I did that. As you mentioned you are a beginner, I'd recc you to use a 5% Niacinamide instead of 10% at the start. Niacinamide is a magic ingredient but also purges. So 5% is the safest bet.\nI'd say empty the niacinamide first which will prolly take around 4-5 months with regular use. And if the black heads \/ white heads persist try using salicylic acid. Because salicylic acid isn't for everyone imo. For hyperpigmention, please please wear sunscreen. If aqualogica suits you go for it. Personally it depends on your exposure to sun. If u are out in the sun for a longer periods of time, buy a more powerful one which is sweat and water resistant, SPF 50 PA +++.\nI've seen videos on derms saying not to use vitamin C during sun exposure. As it might make your skin photosensitive. Especially for people of color. So vitamin C with sunscreen is a no no no.\n\nI am toner girly. And I love my toners. Since I have dry skin. You can try exfoliating toners since you have black heads. Minimalist pha is a good choice BTW. Pixi glo tonic if your budget permits.\n\nI heard Derma Co cica serum is a all rounder serum. So take a look at it. Since it has kojic acid it might help you with the hyper pigmentation. \n\nI think cosrx aha might do wonders for you. Opt for snail mucin if it's really necessary. If you feel your skin is dry, dehydrated or skin barrier is broken.\n\nI'd say stay away from the ordinary peel for at least a year. It isn't designed for beginners. And derms say that it isn't POC safe. As it might cause hyperpigmention. I've been doing skin care for two years but I am still scared to purchase it, since it has 30% aha.\n\nFor beginners I'd recc something like a formulax lactic acid lotion, minimalist lactic acid, deconstruct beginner's exfoliating serum. Once a week since you'll be using niacinamide \/ salicylic acid.\n\nLastly, start with twice a week. And slowly build your routine. Please don't get excited and go Loco and buy a shit ton of products. BEEN THERE. Start with one product a month. So you would know which product suits you and which doesn't. It's a veryyyy slow process. From building a routine to seeing results. So take time and enjoy your process. Don't expect results too soon.\n\nMy last advice is, if you have the budget please go to a derm. Skin care is more of a hobby to me. I don't have any skin concerns so I am just having fun with it. But with your case, going to derm is plausible because you don't have much ideas about what suits you best. You will save a lot of money too imo. Since pharma products are wayy cheaper and bigger.\n\nDon't get fooled by these ig influencers that will give you a lot of 'recommendations'. Buy a product only if it's absolutely necessary. Few quality products is wayyyy better than a lot of cheap products. So save your money and buy the ones with a lot of reviews, clinically tested, from legit companies. That's all I can recall. At least for now. My dm is open for you. Ping me if you need anything at all. Will be happy to help.\n\nThanks u\/thebabybaba for sharing this gorgeous girl's post \ud83c\udf7b","u\/chocosmurf13 welp!","25M daily 3 times face wash panuven, veliya pogum pothu moisturizer use panuven, night thoongum pothu loreal serum poduven.

Everyone is different and there may be a specific active that your skin doesn't agree with. If you overload right off the bat, chances are your skin is going to get irritated and you'll have to take a break from all products with actives. Also, even just sticking to 2-3 actives\/products will get you good results.\n\nAs for niacinamide 10%, that's probably too much to start with. Try 5% in the beginning and if your skin can tolerate it, get 10% the next time. I've been using a 5% serum and my skin still couldn't tolerate 10% when I tried. \n\nIf your concern is mainly dull skin and blackheads, you may want to consider a retinol\/retinoid product. Keep in mind that you'll need a dermat prescription for a retinoid but it's very cost effective. I myself use adapalene (needs prescription) and it doubles as an exfoliant. Texture has never been better. Retinol is OTC so you wouldn't need a prescription for that. However, if you choose to use this, just remember to not apply it near your eyes. \n\nAbout sunscreen with vitamin C, unless the bottle discloses the percentage of vitamin c in it, 10\/20% whatever, I don't think it'll be effective. Generally 10% is the lower end that is considered effective. Again, 20% might be too much to start with. \n\nAlso, just a friendly suggestion, a dermat visit will save you a lot of money in the long run. When you start looking up skincare yourself, you feel so compelled to buy every other product you see. I've been there. But it's usually just a waste of money. Pharma products are pretty awesome, dare I say it, far superior to the newer online skincare brands. Your dermat will have good suggestions of those as per your concern.\n\nHope this helps :)","25M, slightly oily skin. one time when taking pics along with my friends, I noticed my skin was pale and not looking alive.

Your AHA \/ BHA \/ PHA are acids that attack the top layer of skin and remove black heads, guns and acne your retinol( probably the most researched product) , vit C helps in the growth of collagen and heals the acne scars and helps in hyper pigmentation and your niacinamide \/ ceramide protects and repairs the skin Barrier. \n12.

Very narrow roads and traffic jams during peak hours in city hotspots.","1. Not an issue\n2. Pet healthcare scene is great. But I don\u2019t think 24*7 hospitals are there.\n3. Most of kochi is peaceful. You should come down and look at flats. Kakkanad might be a good bet.\n4. Apps are there but supermarkets are ubiquitous and much more convenient. They also deliver.\n5. Many North Indian housemaids are available and most Malayali maids speak basic English but broken.","1. Wont be an issue in most cases if you can speak in English to most people, and Hindi to many less. Minor inconvenience, but you will pickup basic malayalam to survive pretty soon. \n2. There are many reliable Vets and few 24\/7 hospitals. You can network with other pet parents from community and Subhash park on certain weekdays.\n3. The whole Kerala is pretty well connected with decent internet. Fiber connectivity exists everywhere in city and suburbs.\n4. Instamart cover 100% of city and Kakkanad. Blinkit just started last month and is ramping up.\n5. Hindi speaking maids are plenty. There is a reliable agency called maidinkochi (not sure name is right) who provide only vetted Hindi speaking maids. I have tried them before.","I have seen others give you good advice regarding moving to Kochi. I have something to ask that's on the other end of the spectrum, per se.\n\nWhy exactly are you moving to Kochi? You guys have Wfh, are non-malayalis, have 3 dogs. So, why choose Kochi?\nPlease don't take this in any other way; I'm just curious.\n\nThe kerala weather is nothing to boast of. The heat is unbearable at times, and Kochi is slowly becoming polluted and the air quality is decreasing per year.\n\nIf you have the option to relocate to any place, why choose Kochi? Why not somewhere near the mountains where the air is purer and the facilities, though may be few, do exist?\nYou'll get better environment for your budget, and better space for your dogs. So, why Kochi? :)","1. Neither of us speak Malayalam\u2014will that be a problem?  \n- it won't be a problem as Kochi has all kinds of people living here. \n\n2. How\u2019s the pet healthcare scene in Kochi? Like, are there reliable vets and 24x7 hospitals?  \n- yes, we do have many good pet hospitals, both public and pvt. But I doubt if there are any 24x7 pet hospitals.\n\n3. We're homebodies who love our peace and WiFi. Any areas you\u2019d recommend with good neighbourhood and uninterrupted internet connectivity?\n- There are many good neighbourhoods in and around the city, especially in Kaloor, Kadavantra, Panampilly, Changampuzha park, MG road etc. and connectivity won't be a problem here in Kochi, imo. But for renting an independent house with a garden where you can accommodate 3 dogs can be a tough task. I rarely see house owners renting out their properties to people with pets. Even if you need an independent house with garden, you'll have to pay 30k+ per month.\n\n4. Are apps like Zepto, Blinkit, or Swiggy Instamart a thing there for groceries and supplies?  \nBlinkit, Instamart and bb has got good service here. I don't know if zepto is available.\n\n5. What about house help? Since we don\u2019t know the language (yet!), would it be tough to find reliable help in the beginning?  \nYou can find part time househelp with the help of some agencies. But I think a full time house help would be hard to find, but still you can manage to get it if you're ready to pay.","Hey we're North Indians been living in Kochi suburbs (a village) for 8 years now... \n-Language isn't an issue... We still don't speak Malayalam (it's a hard tongue and we northies anyway get corrected when we try to speak)\n- Pet hospitals are aplenty and pet supply shops are also many... We liked Cochin Pet Hospital \n- Independent houses are a better bet, many societies are not allowing pets, especially dogs (ours didn't) ...so make sure you check\n- Look for suburban areas, cheaper, cleaner and even cooler\n- if you are moving for your dogs, assess the areas to see if other people have pets in the area... Our area has many but most dogs were in cages.","Hi! Thanks for your submission.\n\nPlease note that we have a daily thread for casual discussion.

Basically restaurants like McDonalds and Faasos used Dunzo to deliver their orders when their own delivery boys were busy or not available during early\/late hours. Even today, Swiggy partners with Rapido for this so if there is no Swiggy partner in your area, you will get a Rapido rider.  \n\nDunzo was by far the most reputed and reliable last mile service, which I can say as a customer of many such deliveries from the businesses I ordered from. And apart from Rapido, Shadowfax was Dunzo's main competitor for most of these years at least in my city. I mostly saw Shadowfax being used by smaller companies or to cut costs. But Shadowfax deliveries were always late and had bad or no live tracking. So the apps using those were less trustworthy to me as a customer.   \n\nThis instant grocery thing really took off during COVID and I think that's when Dunzo started their instant delivery thing. But I don't think it's their main business even today at all. Couldn't find any resource on how much revenue their grocery vertical generates but it will likely not be anywhere near the B2B.  \n\nAs of today there are a lot B2B last mile delivery companies (especially Rapido which started this in 2020) so they are facing stiff competition since COVID in multiple verticals. And their D2C grocery vertical directly competing with their business clients (e.g. Bigbasket, Spencers, etc. all have used Dunzo at some point) might not be helping too much. And in the consumer space there's Swiggy Genie, Uber Connect, etc. while Dunzo have made the courier\/package sending service a small (basically hidden) section in their app. So maybe that's why some kids might not know their main business.\n\nHonestly I really liked where Dunzo was going before COVID, that was when all these medium size restaurant chains started their own apps and delivered using Shadowfax and Dunzo. But seems like the cost of maintaining all that tech was too much and they are again focusing on Swiggy\/Zomato, with these apps being abandoned or in maintenance mode. Which sucks as a consumer because it's a duopoly of Zomato\/Swiggy.\n\nDotPe (also partnered with Dunzo AFAIK) was also trying to do something like Thrive\/ONDC before and during COVID but never took off outside of a select few restaurant chains. Right now, Thrive and ONDC (both partnered with Dunzo) are trying to break in as alternate options again - which is great. So I would really like Dunzo to not die. Unfortunately as a consumer I have a subscription for the duopoly (Zomato\/Swiggy) and a habit of almost 6-7 years now which will take a long time to break. EatSure\/Eatclub I try occasionally but their menu is really bland and boring to me as it's the same shit as 7 years ago.   \n\nMotabhai (Reliance Retail) has a significant investment in Dunzo. And Motabhai is not a regard. Something is up with the financials of Dunzo, either mismanagement or bad luck with COVID. But their business concept is fine. Regards on this subreddit think Dunzo is a grocery delivery app only lmao. The only thing in common with Swiggy and Zomato is that Dunzo takes commission from both merchants and delivery riders. \n\nI don't think Swiggy or Zomato will enter the B2B last mile delivery space. Simply because a lot of the clients will be the same businesses who will sell the same crap for a much higher commission on their own apps vs. the merchant's own platform. They will not let businesses use their own riders to build a competitor to their main business (food delivery) and break their duopoly. \n\nP.S: Not a dunzo bagholder. Just my observations.","Dunzo is done for","Zomato will only outrule in this segment. The company has posted profit and launched some more revenue generating options which will likely take it ahead once the next quarter results come out.","Am I the only one (read: arseh**e) who wishes that these startups fail?\n\nI really want these startups to fail and give everyone a reality check.
