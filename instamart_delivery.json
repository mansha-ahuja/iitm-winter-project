this is what happened in the evening having discussed with my wife what all grocery we need i order them the delivery guy came to the door on expected time after me greeting him with thanks\nhe said  sir ek pyaaj mil sakta hai kya  \nme  kyu \nhe  aise hi khaane k liye \nme  okayafter getting a pyaaj i asked  koi tantra mantra to nahi karoge na bhaiya \nhe  nahi sirwith innocent smile\n\n\nafter i he left taking the onion me and my wife were discussing if he genuinely needed to eat it or going to do tantra mantra\ud83d\ude02my wife said may be onion is so expensive here he might be asking for onion from every where he delivers so he have enough to make food using it     \ndid any one else has experienced this could anyone tell why he asked for this ","1":"i was walking with a friend of mine male opposite citi mall andheri west and this swiggy guy who is on an electric bike stops us beckons that he is wanting our time my guard went up while he stopped and parked his bike  now he is showing that his phone is hanging up and has stopped working because of multiple deliveries apparently then he says he is paying the rent of the electric bike and was asking for 400 straight up i didnt even realise how he was asking this amount i didnt understand anything then said he needs penalty amount \n400 is nothing much couldve helped him yes but honestly my gut was taken aback that randomly he is upfront asking me cash he pestered my friend first then when we finally told him didnt have cash and wanted to move ahead he again loudly asks me madam aapke pass hai kya \nnot sure of the new scam or anything but as a woman in mumbai id be even more wary of ordering anything online or just generally delivery partners around on the road or anything safety perspective\nis this like a new scam \nps not looking down on anyone have been thinking about this suspicious behaviour since yesterday ki kya thha bhai wo ","2":"hi i work as a delivery person for instamart around the jayanagar area the hub is located in jayanagar kr road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi jayanagar nr colony srinagar gavipuram  banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nif youre ordering during heavy rains please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged then it falls on the delivery persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n ","3":"the swiggy instamart dark store is quite close to my place 1 min by two wheeler according to google maps\n\n\nthe usual delivery time from that dark store ends up being 4 mins but actually takes 10  15 mins which includes the delivery person most of the times calling me inspite of the address being very clear along with hard to miss landmarks right on the main road \n\n\nbut because they use some kinda radius which they consider to change the status of delivery person as arrived at the location the order is always marked as arrived at my location even before it leaves the dark store potentially as soon as its packed \n\n\ni dont really mind the order coming in 10  15 mins or even more than that also it only gets marked as delivered after the order is in my hand so that not an issue but the time it considers is that initial 23 mins\n\n\nsuch metrics can and are definitely skewing the overall statistics they present\n\nwhy are they registering such skewed metrics or is it just how the app is made to function what do youll think about it\n\n","5":"a deloitte report estimates indian quick commerce to be a massive 40 bn market by 2030 some dominant grocery delivery models in india\ud83d\udc47\n\nindias quick commerce landscape in 2024 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 the rapid growth seen in the quick commerce business has compelled zomato to double down on blinkit it is looking to nearly double its store count by the end of fy25 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 mukesh ambaniled ril is close to launching its own quick commerce operations through jiomart  looking to deliver groceries in select cities in under 30 minutes and is likely to ramp up operations by next year \n\n\ud83d\udd38 reliance reportedly plans to take it to around 1000 cities in future and jiomart will tap into reliance retails network of over 18000 stores across the country\n\n\ud83d\udd38 that kind of scale would allow jiomart to potentially catapult the existing group of quick commerce apps  blinkit swiggys instamart and zepto  and also end the nascent ambitions of tataowned bigbasket and flipkart before they take off\n\n\ud83d\udd38 flipkart is fresh with funds from google and majority stakeholder walmart and is also likely to make a major push for grocery delivery where blinkit zepto and swiggy have created welloiled playbooks","6":"this may be grossly wrong but your critical comments are welcome below is table of orders process by blinkit taken from various sources\n\nwith 5l orders per day and value per order rs 640 gross order value per q in crs is rs 2880 crs against the company claim of 4950 cr\n\n\n\ngross order value per quarter in crores is far below the claim made by company value per order and orders per day are taken from economic times report and annual report but hings dont add up\n\nalso number of delivery partners and total deliveries in a day dont add up\n\non top of this cofounder of zomato is wife of blinkit ceo and she has resigned today further in 2 years the company turned from 1200 cr loss to 351 cr profit with the same business model and nominal increase in charges platform fee revenue is 180 cr only so that has not impacted profitability\n\nfor sure something big is cooking up as all the cofounders are leaving\n\nkindly share your views\n\n\n\n","7":"so i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more","8":"hey everyone im dealing with an ongoing issue with my airtel axis credit card and wanted to see if anyone here has faced something similar or could offer advice i was approved for the card in july but since then i havent received the correct cashback based on the cards cashback policy ive raised the issue multiple times but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution\n\nhere are the details\n\nfirst month i spent about 2500 on swiggy but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountbut based on my calculations i should have received 640\n\nswiggy transactions issue some swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as instamart orders which likely use a different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed","9":"a few days ago a few policemen beat up one of the zomato rider near prem nagar this isnt in the news because this wasnt reported but it has happened if a zomato rider comes to your doorstep please ask them about it there was even a strike by around 100150 zomato delivery partners near it park thats where zomatos office is\n\nand this new rule by the dm says no delivery partner to be available after 12 am is bullshit\n\ni run a cloud kitchen and i used to do this at night thats when i get all my orders but now its all zero how do i pay my bills and the vendors\n\npeople with zero experience and ground knowledge call shots for the rest of us  how is this not attacking our democracy\n\nthe police comes and takes bribes from almost every restaurant and now only a select few are open unofficially after 12 am outlets like gaylord is operational and doing their own delivery  but the police isnt questioning them there are barricades and police check points at clock tower gaylord had their lights turned on all and the police knew but no one questioned them \n\nthese rules dont matter to the ones who are connected i guess\n\nim just mad at the local government for putting a band aid on the whole situation just to save their skin after the whole incident that happened theyll do everything except catch the actual culprits  people who drink and drive\n\nlast night there was checking at ballupur the car in front of us had no number plates the police stopped the car checked the trunk and let them go same with us wheres alcometer why were those guys not questioned driving without number plates is illegal\n\nzomato swiggy blinkit instamart  everything closes down  and the city feels dead it feels like im back in 2021 when there were no restaurants available and this is affecting small outlets like mine delivery partners who used to work full time on zomato at night and people who order every day after the night shift","10":"zomato swiggy all are on hypergrowth mode they are doing good generating good revenue and also they are generating employment but what is not good\n\nzomato is trading at about 180 ttm pe it is about 9 times the nifty so if gdp is growing at 8 to sustain its valuation it need to grow at 30 every year and yes it is growing\n\nnow lets read the fineprint  swiggy is a total wonder it is still burning cash\n\nparticularsfy22fy23fy24\n\nrevenue5704 crore8264 crore11247 crore\nnet loss3628 crore4179 crore2350 crore\n\nit looks amazing that loss is reducing and they are about to reach profitability having staggering 11247 crore revenue the issue is market cap which is crossing 1 lakh crore that too on zero profit generally loss making companies are valued at 2x revenue max 4x but it is whopping 9x revenue multiple\n\neven in recent q2  it did well 30 yoy growth at loss of 6255 crore\n\nbut when you look at qoq it is a different story\n\nloss widened from 611 crore to 625 crore revenue rose 1177 from 3322 to 3601 crore but fineprint is it came on back of very heavy competitive quick commerce business instamart food delivery business grown qoq at 4 which is very concerning it means food delivery revenue is flattened this quarter\n\nconsidering 80 weightage to food business in valuation  ebit of 122 crore then also it is 250300 pe higher than zomato zomato profit is five times they said will take 2 more years to be profitable why\n\nthats why i keep on saying extremely high pe means very high risk again it is not recommendations it is how you analyze the fine print number wrapped into big big business reports","11":"ive tried to delve deep into them these are what i found\n\n1 idfc first bank \n   swiggy one lite 10 free delivery  offers on swiggy  10 free

feedback form which you receive in your mail which rates myntra services and then giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it \n\nwhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver itll be given separately they are saying no its from the same form when explained that delivery rating is separate from myntra rating theyre unable to explain themselves and saying no its the same its not \n\n\nif youre ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them right it has happened with me several times with even zomato instamart zepto etc \n\nso i thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback but the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of myntra not the delivery executive \n\nhe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail i told him i wont because i do not want to rate myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and thats all they should care about \n\nplease dont give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service if yes tell them you can do that on app and dont let them rate it for you \n","13":"ive always said getting things delivered to your home is a luxury and not a necessity\n\nbut today i realised swiggy might be sneakily making this instamart service more luxurious\n\nback in april 2024 i was paying 4 as the handling fee and on my order today i just paid 767 as the handling fee\n\n9175 increase in handling charges in the last 6 months despite them offering swiggy one which waives off delivery  for orders above 199 one needs to be reminded that these services are a luxury and needs to be used like one\n\ntry being more attentive the next time you go through checkout on any online platform they might be sneaking in some privilege charges you wouldnt notice otherwise","14":"so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n","15":"average order times have gone up to 4550 mins ive had to cancel deliveries because no agent was found for upto 90 mins instamart blinkit and zepto seem to have stopped services after midnight zomatos pricing is madness unless you select the 19 rupee priority delivery your order will take an hour ","17":"dont know if its the correct subreddit but i trust this subreddit a little too much so am posting here few hours age i was at college was extremely hungry and college canteen doesnt have good food by the time were free all the canteen food is already finished i resently downloaded swiggy  have seen swiggy delivery partners many times in college so ordered on swiggy was craving cup noodles so ordered cup noodles on instamart  ordered 4 cup noodles to take home for my family to taste and one for me there it showed ill get free lays and pepsi with it it sounded great would get to get full without stressing the pocket much the delivery parner came but only had the cup noddles i asked about the pepsi and lays he had no idea about it he said to ask the customer service now ive heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so dont know how to ask im really confused what do do how to inform swiggy \ndont take it in the wrong way i didnt ask them to offer anything free but if you do promse pls do send it really hurts\ud83d\ude2d tagging uswiggyofficial\nhopefully thatll help and others hopefully wont have to deal with it i downloaded swiggy resently and really hope to have the best experience with you","19":"the most delivery associates ask for is a rating but over the years and across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many","20":"everyone whos living in virarnalasopara west should order from flipkart minutes as cheaply and more 99 free delivery not like 199 from blinkit and fuck someone tell me why zepto and instamart is not working in nsp west","21":"after many years i decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet ive used various cards in the past including hsbc hdfc and amex but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process","22":"ivvala oka vichithram jarigindhi folks \n\nnaadhi oka extremely routine and boring life ani naa opinion not that its unsatisfactory im happy with my boring life at 25 i know that i

away from lulu mall but i still visit it once a week either on weekends or weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business","25":"so recently i bought vegetables from big basket and they were of really good qualityi was casually talking to the delivery guy about how they are performing here in tvm my assumption

thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled

in mind before ordering do they accept upi at the time of delivery","37":"i use swiggy a lot both food and particularly swiggy instamart\niam living alone for the time being  studying for it i used to give tips 20 or 30 and water in the beginning a lot but since i used it a lot it was adding up i decided to stop tipping got a maid for house swiggy food i was using less\n\ntodays i ordered 9 tender coconut cause its hot and got it delivered i picked it up from porch and took into kichen gave the bag back the guy ridiculed and told me why no tips for chai or something since it was the heaviest pack he had also be aware it takes less than 8 min for the guy get here from swiggy warehouse\n\ni told him i use the service and have taken subscriptions for free delivery and is already paying a premium\ni use the platform too much to tip all the time since he pushed for tips and kinda insisted iam not sure\n\ni was considering weather to tip him from phone once i go back in now not sure\n\nfyikeep in mind as an nri i get asked for money daily from neighbors to friends to relatives to shop owners to who ever the f i run by so iam practicing saying no also if i dont give a guilt trip is usually there\n\nwhats ur thoughts \n\n","38":"swiggy fleet is managed in two ways one way for instamart and the other way for food and genie it is the same person who can be assigned any of the orders when a food or genie order is placed by the customer then the delivery partner is assigned who reaches the pickup location but in case of instamart swiggy wants the deliveries within 10 minutes so guess what happens the delivery partner is summoned even before you place the order you might just be visiting the instamart section with no intention of ordering or just decided not to order from instamart for some reason the delivery partner is already directed towards the instamart warehouse  \nthis has happened multiple times with me and happened again today i was waiting at instamart for 20 min then they unassigned my order if it was food or genie i would have gotten some money for waiting but as it was instamart a subsidiary of swiggy they save every penny and not pay any wait time they use this money to show the investors that instamart was a good investment to make\n\neven during peak hours and late nights instamart deliveries dont pay anything extra do yall pay extra for instamart deliveries during surge and late nights","39":"some are expiring in 2 days some are only for first time users sorted az ig\n\nx200b\n\nskincarebeauty\n\ndermaco 350off on min 899

phone  subscriptions 2k although some are billed annually\n6 movies 2k ticketsconfectionary\n7 petrol 4k\n8 amazon 2k\n9 offline spends 5k\n\napart from these expenses maybe the odd yearly large purchase\n\ni only have a dcb metal currently addon from my brother and i have been buying vouchers for swiggy and amazon so dining dineout groceries instamart and amazon fresh and delivery get taken care of this way having this card also takes lounge access off my list of priorities needed in the card\n\nfurthermore i am eligible for sapphiro through the alumni program though i am yet to apply for it for anyone whos applied and gotten it any tips would be appreciated ques do i have to be eligible salarywise as well what supporting documents do they require\n\ni make 1 or 2 trips a year to my hometown so i was eyeing an airline card too maybe the vistara ones premium economybusiness class tickets do sound very tempting\n\ni also dont like the idea of paying joining or annual fees i would like to avoid that as much as possible i know getting a fyf subsequently a waiver after spends or a ltf card may prove to be difficult but i am looking for suggestions that may eventually offer the possibility at the very least\n\napart from this i think hdfc swiggy may be a good option sorry if this feels all over the place at the end of the day i just want to maximise the value i can get from my expenses in any way cashback points etc any and all inputs will be greatly appreciated\nalso i already bank with icici and hdfc if thats of any consideration \n\nthank you for your

hasnt processed yet i have talked with the support 3 times from that day any thing i can do ","43":"warning against using swiggy instamart and rant posting on behalf of a friend in her words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom","44":"i stay in rai durg area and swiggy instamart has been inaccessibleunavailable on my app since few weeks

issues faced by peer delivery partners including a few that confronted myself the dp support is very frustrating the cos take them for granted despite clearly knowing that dps are the ones which are actually the breadwinner for the company itself i admit other business units like sales and administration contribute however the indifference to support delivery partners is beyond acceptable tolerable limits  \na few issues are hereunder\n\n1 no monthly account statement for earnings and other notes other than weekly payout notes swiggy does not seem to be interested in giving out these lack of transparency because at times payout denied and also delayed with unnecessary and irrational debits which there is no efficient grievance redressal team at swiggy\n2 swiggy keeps giving robocalls for notifications through their vendors exotel despite no explicit optin reporting to trai dnd and escalating is of no avail as exotel keeps calling from different numbers\n3 despite during onboarding they advertise of no onboarding fee down the line after a few weeks they debit a steep charge for the same without a rational justification this is over and above the security deposit as well\n4 the instamart at select locations i confirmed the same at tambaram chennai delays the inscan of the reusable bags and then if a warning is issued regarding nonreturn they cooly respond a technical error and is covering up\n5 refusal to change shifts and hence delaydenial of incentives the shift form is cryptic and support is not assisting in changing the same\n6 though the incentives do not say about active shift they use it as a hidden condition to avoid giving to delivery partners\n7 more than 100 orders delivery partner need to be enrolled in partner club however a number of

need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications

swiggy gears up to go public there are some interesting factors for investors to consider on one hand swiggy has established itself as one of indias top two food delivery players alongside zomato with a strong user base and brand loyalty plus its been diversifying with offerings like instamart quick commerce and swiggy genie personalized delivery services tapping into new markets like rapid grocery delivery\n\nhowever swiggys drhp shows persistent losses since inception and negative cash flow though it has made recent progress in narrowing those losses the company still relies heavily on discounts and marketing to retain users which puts pressure on profit margins theres also increased regulatory scrutiny on gig workers and potential tax liabilities which could add to its costs and operational complexities in the future furthermore swiggy faces strong competition from zomato and new entrants like the governmentbacked ondc which offers food delivery at significantly lower prices this puts swiggy under pressure to innovate and retain its user base while managing costs effectively\n\nthat said there are still reasons some investors might find swiggy attractive indias online food delivery and quickcommerce markets are still relatively young and swiggy has a solid track record of growth and brand recognition its quickcommerce arm instamart is growing fast and could potentially become a profitable segment swiggys ability to diversify beyond food delivery could make it a more resilient and versatile company in the long run\n\nso the big question is whether swiggy can achieve sustainable profitability and capitalize on its brand and market position or if ongoing competition and operational challenges will weigh down its performance what do you think are the growth prospects worth the risk\n\n\n\n","60":"hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past 3 years ive

Because VCs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden. Quick refunds, more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup.\n\nMany VCs now know that the market size for these services in India is small. So, VC funding is drying up. To remain alive these companies now need to become profitable. For that they need to try and extract that marginal cost. This can be through:\n\n1. Smaller fleets to reduce cost. This causes delivery times to go up.\n2. Bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size. This again causes delivery times to go up.\n3. Asking extra money if bunching isn't opted by customers.\n4. Saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons. This causes customer support quality to go down. Extra checks on claims, asking for pics, emails etc.\n5. Increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue.\n6. Hiking prices on subscriptions. Because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service. It is counter intuitive but true.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies. I use Swiggy and Bbinstant a lot. It has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak.\nThey are grouping order nowadays, in last 3-4 months I've had delivery person going in opposite direction, coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls, trying to search through my order in their bag, turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me.\u00a0\nAt least Blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem.

Have read so many cases about this.\nFake images in listings is not a Swiggy scam. You don't get Shah Rukh Khan with Lux and Juhi Chawla with Taaza.

With an 80L + annual income , why are you applying for cards like swiggy hdfc instead of just upgrading your regalia gold to infinia ?\nI'm more interested to know what you do for a living?\nCRIF & Exeperian are secondary, primarily, only Cibil is checked by the banks.\nit seems like you own\/run a business, banks prefer salaried employees in comparison with business people, even if business people file for higher ITR. \n\n  \nanyways, what the your 3 major spend category? or maybe tell us platform. \n\n  \nbut in general, I will recommend you, HSBC live+ (10% on zomato, dining in and dmart, 1.5 all other, but ignore if you only use swiggy since you already have HDFC swiggy), amazon icic or axis FK (depending on the platform you shop from), kotak myntra if you shop from myntra, axis airtel if you have airtel broadband or SIM, \n\n  \nso with the card you already have and if you add any of the above mentioned cards, you have covered lounge access, amazon or FK shoppping, food delivery\/dine in, utility payments, myntra shopping, 5% on most online spents using swiggy card, UPI card, groceries shopping at dmart and miscellaneous offline payments\n1. An 80L+ earner preferring Minor cashback over Major Rewards seems counter-intuitive.  \n2. To experience a better version of SBI, apply for their Aurum. Comes with great Lifestyle benefits.  \n3.

Why do you even need grocery delivery in under 30 mins? Services would be much better if no 30min delivery for groceries.\nLet me say that as an NRI who frequents lulu abroad, I don't enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it.\n\nThe crowd and parking.\n\nThe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability. Shopping at Ramachandrans at MOT is less stressful but they don't have extensive product range. If you're looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit, you're most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher.\n\nSpeaking of fruits and veggies, most local vendors don't allow you to pick your own selection. They mix good and stale ones and hand it over. Places like lulu, Ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so.\n\nAnother advantage of Lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops. I don't think the young gen are accustomed or most likely won't be future clients of such local butchery shops.\n\n>Can anyone start a delivery business like Swiggy Instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes, with competitive rates compared to these giants?\n\nDuring covid, after trying many home delivery services, I relied mostly on AM needs and Farmers Fresh Zone. The latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users. The problem with farmers Fresh zone was the products were okayish(not fresh) and their estimated time for delivery uncertain(no live tracking similar to zomato\/swiggy) and it seems they've acquired AM needs now.\n\nHorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet.\n\nComing back to lulu, shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods.\nFrom my experience working in FnV sector\nThese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need daily(even if the supply is low they need it).The company won't directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and stored(the most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storage)to ensure continuous supply.\nSo the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired products.The company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc.. and also there would be anti dumping policies (they can't handle waste so let others handle em) so the vendor after procuring,grading,transporting they would always be at risk of rejection.Because of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium that's why it's expensive.\nThe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster before it goes stale. Farmers are being utilised by the corporate without them knowing it.\n\nFruits and vegetables are not machine made they form naturally there would be defects and problem but you could always choose what's good.Support local business as they are the real backbone of farmers.","25":"Wow man I didn't know they were here. Installing the app now hehe\nI do. Even my mom says their vegetables are of top quality. But the thing is after a purchase, for the second purchase we may have to pay extra amount (15-20 rs usually for me) due to them bringing not exactly the weight of vegetables we buy. (eg: if we buy 2 kg onion and they bring 2.2 kg we have to pay for that extra amount in the next purchase) which is reasonable but I'm just pointing it out because I haven't seen that going on in other grocery apps and websites.\nRegularly ordering from Big basket for 6+ months now.\n\nGood quality, never had a problem.\n\nIf you have an HDFC credit card, use their smartbuy platform and buy BB voucher for accelerated reward points.\nI stopped using as they don't give bags and I live in an apartment.\nNever knew they were operating here.

I have started saving a lot by getting a cook for myself. Also, healthy and hygienic food. But what you are doing, needs some serious commitment.\nThese online deliveries are a major expense, and we don't even realize it as 300-500 for each order accumulates to a large amount monthly. \n\nWhen I'm in bangalore, Swiggy\/dining easily crosses 10-12k monthly. Now I'm in my hometown for more than a month and it did not even cross 1k. \n\nFor fruits, vegetables and meat, local stores are atleast 25-30% cheaper and have better quality.\nI look up for menu on zomato and add it to cart , then search the hotel on google and call them and place order...plus am not the kind who wants starbucks coffee at home , so this method cover my needs when i need to order and not want to pay taxes on zomato...","55":"Business models like BlinkIt usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale. In it's abscene, it's just burning VC money. \n\nUnlike your typical Kirana store, you have a mobile application to maintain (iOS + Android), marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees. Your usual Kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do.\nLike it depends if people in that city prefer convience, & also has high spending power. Than it'll work.\nTier 2-3 cities usually don\u2019t have that kind of spending power. They would go out and buy it. Tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra. \n\nBlinkit and Zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them. At any day I would save 5-10rs if I find a better price in either of the platforms. \n\nTier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit. Unless you don\u2019t have money to burn forget about it\nIt depends on the people...are they aware of such things?\nRecently, I came across the Namm Yatri app and loved their business model. Unlike Ola and Uber, which take a commission on every ride, NammaYatri uses a subscription-based SaaS approach. Drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app, and the rest of the money goes directly to them. It made me think: what if we applied this to grocery delivery? Instead of relying on dark warehouses like Zepto, we could use the existing network of local kirana stores. Consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store. The app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock, and delivery agents (who pay a small subscription fee) would pick up the items and deliver them. Payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth.\n\nBut of course, there are some challenges:\n\t\u2022\tStock availability\n\t\u2022\tStore hours limitations\n\t\u2022\tPrice inconsistency (can be solved with in-app payments)\n\t\u2022\tProduct quality\n\nIt\u2019s a simple idea, but I think it could really work if executed well.","56":"The concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up.\n\nIt's the After sales support I'm worried about.

Zepto will probably be acquired by Swiggy or Zomato.\n\nTo me, the most worrying thing for Swiggy is Zomato's growing so much faster and has so much better margins but its listing at 60% of Zomato's market cap and might even drop prices further, so could be an interesting play.","60":"**Here are some highlights from the Winter '25 Edition:**\u00a0\n\n* **Checkout Blocks**\u00a0are now available on all plans, allowing merchants to offer customized thank you pages and integrated chat apps into the checkout.\n* **Draft Orders**\u00a0now support Checkout UI extensions, Bundle orders, and checkout rules powered by Shopify Functions.\n* **Customer Account Extensions**, app blocks that help enhance a customer's account, can now be added directly into customer account pages, allowing features like order and return management, surveys, and self-serve functionality for quotes, invoicing, and bulk ordering.\n* **Shopify Bundles**\u00a0are now able to be sold directly through Shopify POS, and\u00a0**metafields**\u00a0are available through POS.

Also If you are a regular , they even price some items below MRP and pass on the savings. Also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off, you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product.\nSo far SWIGGY ZEPTO was making losses and they were burning VC PE money.\n\nBut that era is coming to an end.\n\nIt is never possible to deliver at the costs they did earlier. Forgot profits. Extreme losses, but they had backing of VC PE money.\n\nThat money is drying out fast.\nI agree. For small purchases now, I've gone back to visiting local shops and buying from there.

Then he says he is paying the rent of the electric bike and was asking for 400\u20b9 straight up. I didn\u2019t even realise how he was asking this amount. I didn\u2019t understand anything then said he needs penalty amount. \n400\u20b9 is nothing much, could\u2019ve helped him yes but honestly my gut was taken aback that randomly he is upfront asking me cash. He pestered my friend first then when we finally told him didn\u2019t have cash and wanted to move ahead- he again loudly asks me \u201cmadam aapke pass hai kya\u201d. \nNot sure of the new scam or anything; but as a woman in Mumbai, i\u2019d be even more wary of ordering anything online or just generally delivery partners around on the road or anything (safety perspective).\nIs this like a new scam? \nPS- not looking down on anyone, have been thinking about this suspicious behaviour since yesterday. Ki kya thha bhai wo. ","2":"A little humanity goes a long way Hi, i work as a delivery person for instamart around the jayanagar area. The hub is located in jayanagar KR road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi, Jayanagar, NR colony, srinagar, gavipuram , Banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nIf you're ordering during heavy rains, please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged, then it falls on the delivery persons head. Please use UPI during pay on delivery.\n\nIf your place has no lift, please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs( I've had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans )\n\nA lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money, its pathetic and please don't do that. The only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes aren't accepted through machines and we literally can't go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nMany people literally forget they've ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nPlease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly.\n(One instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number, when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that person's relative and then when i got to the door, i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment. All that person could've done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate)\nSo please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\nDogs, as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house. So please if you have dogs, please come near the gate and collect the order.\n\nAnd this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nPlease understand that the base pay (if the distance is less than 1kms) swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day. They're paid for the distance they ride, not the number of floors they climb.\n\nThis isn't me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective, this is me coming from a humanity perspective.\nThe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and there's no seating area for the riders, or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet.\nSo the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times.\n\nThese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners. So all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people.\n ","3":"Delivery Time  The Swiggy Instamart Dark Store is quite close to my place (1 min by two wheeler according to google maps).\n\n\nThe usual delivery time from that Dark Store ends up being 4 mins. But actually takes 10 - 15 mins (which includes the delivery person most of the times calling me, inspite of the address being very clear along with hard to miss landmarks, right on the main road). \n\n\nBut, because they use some kinda radius which they consider to change the status of delivery person as arrived at the location. The order is always marked as arrived at my location even before it leaves the dark store, potentially as soon as it's packed. \n\n\nI don't really mind the order coming in 10 - 15 mins or even more than that. Also, it only gets marked as delivered after the order is in my hand, so that not an issue. But the time it considers is that initial 2-3 mins.\n\n\nSuch metrics can and are definitely skewing the overall statistics they present.\n\nWhy are they registering such skewed metrics? Or is it just how the app is made to function? What do you'll think about it.\n\n","5":"India\u2019s Grocery wars A Deloitte report estimates Indian quick commerce to be a massive $40 Bn market by 2030.

So, I run a marketing company, and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like Blinkit, instamart, Zepto, and all. Right now, they\u2019re spending lots of money on free deliveries, cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share. But once they start focusing on profits, will people actually continue using them?\n\nTake Zomato and Swiggy, for example\u2014they charge more than the restaurant prices. If these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores, do you think people will still buy from them? The convenience is great for emergencies\u2014but people are willing to pay extra for that every time?\n\nMost of us compare prices and love a good deal. If the discounts go away or things get too expensive, wouldn\u2019t a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets?

I\u2019ve raised the issue multiple times, but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nFirst Month: I spent about \u20b92,500 on Swiggy but only received \u20b9140 in cashback(not yet credited in account).As per the 10% cashback policy, I should have received at least \u20b9200.\n\nSeptember Statement: I earned \u20b9420 in cashback(not yet credited in account)but based on my calculations, I should have received \u20b9640.\n\nSwiggy Transactions Issue: Some Swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as Instamart orders, which likely use a different MCC (Merchant Category Code). Because of this, I\u2019m not getting the right cashback, which is unfair. It seems like a Swiggy issue, but I\u2019m the one being penalized.\n\nMoreover, since I got the card, I haven\u2019t received a single rupee cashback in my statement! I\u2019ve emailed Axis twice about this, and here\u2019s what they replied:\n\n \"We would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldn't be shared since there is category-wise capping. We don't have the function to send the breakup of cashback. Cashbacks are system-generated, and hence, a breakup is not available.

I\u2019m wondering if I can escalate this issue to the RBI Ombudsman, at least regarding the cashback credit issue. Has anyone gone this route before, or can someone guide me on how to proceed?","9":"no delivery after 12 am A few days ago, a few policemen beat up one of the Zomato rider near Prem Nagar. This isn\u2019t in the news because this wasn\u2019t reported, but it has happened. If a Zomato rider comes to your doorstep, please ask them about it. There was even a strike by around 100-150 Zomato Delivery Partners near IT Park (that\u2019s where Zomato\u2019s office is).\n\nAnd this new rule by the DM says no delivery partner to be available after 12 am is bullshit.\n\nI run a cloud kitchen and I used to do this at night (that\u2019s when i get all my orders), but now, it\u2019s all zero. How do I pay my bills and the vendors?\n\nPeople with zero experience and ground knowledge call shots for the rest of us \u2013 how is this not attacking our democracy?\n\nThe police comes and takes bribes from almost every restaurant, and now, only a select few are open (unofficially) after 12 am. Outlets like Gaylord is operational and doing their own delivery - but the police isn\u2019t questioning them. There are barricades and police check points at Clock Tower. Gaylord had their lights turned on all and the police knew, but no one questioned them. \n\nThese rules don\u2019t matter to the ones who are connected, I guess.\n\nI\u2019m just mad at the local government for putting a band aid on the whole situation just to save their skin after the whole incident that happened. They\u2019ll do everything except catch the actual culprits \u2013 people who drink and drive.\n\nLast night, there was checking at Ballupur. The car in front of us had no number plates. The police stopped the car, checked the trunk, and let them go. Same with us. Where\u2019s alcometer? Why were those guys not questioned? Driving without number plates is illegal.\n\nZomato, Swiggy, BlinkIt, Instamart - everything closes down \u2013 and the city feels dead. It feels like I\u2019m back in 2021, when there were no restaurants available. And this is affecting small outlets like mine, delivery partners who used to work full time on zomato at night, and people who order every day after the night shift.","10":"This Food Delivery is super expensive! Zomato, Swiggy all are on hypergrowth mode. They are doing good generating good revenue and also they are generating employment. But what is not good?\n\nZomato is trading at about 180 TTM PE. It is about 9 times the NIFTY. So if GDP is growing at 8%, to sustain its valuation it need to grow at 30% every year and yes, it is growing!\n\nNow lets read the fineprint - Swiggy is a total wonder, it is still burning cash.\n\n|Particulars|FY22|FY23|FY24|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|\u20b95,704 crore|\u20b98,264 crore|\u20b911,247 crore|\n|Net Loss|\u20b93,628 crore|\u20b94,179 crore|\u20b92,350 crore|\n\nIt looks amazing that loss is reducing and they are about to reach profitability. Having staggering 11,247 crore revenue! The issue is market cap which is crossing 1 Lakh crore. That too on zero profit. Generally loss making companies are valued at 2X revenue, max 4X. But it is whopping 9X revenue multiple!\n\nEven in recent Q2 - it did well 30% YoY growth at loss of 625.5 crore.\n\nBut when you look at QoQ it is a different story.\n\nLoss widened from 611 crore to 625 crore. Revenue rose 11.77% from 3322 to 3601 crore. But fineprint is it came on back of very heavy competitive quick commerce business instamart. Food delivery business grown QoQ at 4%. Which is very concerning. It means food delivery revenue is flattened this quarter.\n\nConsidering 80% weightage to food business in valuation - EBIT of 122 crore, then also it is 250-300 PE higher than Zomato! Zomato profit is five times. They said will take 2 more years to be profitable! Why?\n\nThat's why I keep on saying extremely high PE means very high risk. Again it is not recommendations, it is how you analyze the fine print number, wrapped into big big business reports!","11":"Salary account comparision I've tried to delve deep into them, these are what I found:\n\n1.

(Hello, terribly sorry if this isn't the right flair or sub for this. )\n \nEdit- ((No they didn't take my phone but who knows, don't be like me ))\n\nMyntra delivery guys are asking to show Myntra feedback form which you receive in your mail which rates Myntra services and then giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it. \n\nWhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver it'll be given separately they are saying no it's from the same form. When explained that delivery rating is separate from Myntra rating they're unable to explain themselves and saying no it's the same. (It's not) \n\n\nIf you're ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them, right? It has happened with me several times with even Zomato, instamart, zepto etc. \n\nSo I thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback BUT the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of MYNTRA NOT THE DELIVERY EXECUTIVE. \n\nHe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail I told him I won't because I do not want to rate Myntra a 5 without even opening my order. I told him I'll rate him for sure but I don't want to rate Myntra a 5 for no reason. He said no no it's the same form for both . When I questioned his logic he wasn't able to explain and then left. \n\nThe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup, not even delivery. \n\nThe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof. \n\nThis is all really shady and makes no sense. Why should we rate Myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it. When you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and that's all they should care about. \n\nPlease don't give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service. If yes, tell them you can do that on app. And don't let them rate it for you. \n","13":"Sneaky Swiggy I've always said getting things delivered to your home is a luxury and not a necessity.\n\nBut today I realised Swiggy might be sneakily making this instamart service more luxurious.\n\nBack in April 2024 I was paying \u20b94 as the handling fee. And on my order today I just paid 7.67 as the \"handling fee\".\n\n91.75% increase in handling charges in the last 6 months. Despite them offering Swiggy One which waives off delivery ( for orders above \u20b9199) one needs to be reminded that these services are a luxury and needs to be used like one.\n\nTry being more attentive the next time you go through checkout on any online platform. They might be sneaking in some privilege charges you wouldn't notice otherwise.","14":" Found price differences across grocery delivery apps \u2013 building a solution!  So, I was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting. The price on BigBasket was \u20b989, on Blinkit it was \u20b9105, and Zepto had it for \u20b998. Naturally, I wondered \u2013 if the prices for one item differ this much, what about other groceries? I checked a few more items and, sure enough, almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts, promotions, or delivery fees.\n\nThat got me thinking: why isn\u2019t there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps?\n\nImagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get real-time price comparisons from Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, Swiggy Instamart, and others. You\u2019d see all the discounts, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times in one place, allowing you to make informed decisions and save money, just like you do when booking a hotel on Trivago.\n\nI\u2019m planning to build this app and would love feedback, suggestions, or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting. Let\u2019s make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent!  \n\nThe real motive behind this idea is to help people. With rising costs of living, every rupee saved counts. I want to empower people to shop smarter, save time, and make more informed choices. This app isn\u2019t just about convenience \u2013 it\u2019s about making sure everyone has access to the best deals, no matter what they\u2019re buying or where they live.\n\n","15":"Is it just me or have the delivery services significantly degraded in the past month? Average order times have gone up to 45-50 mins. I've had to cancel deliveries because no agent was found for upto 90 mins. Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto seem to have stopped services after midnight. Zomato's pricing is madness, unless you select the 19 rupee priority delivery your order will take an hour. ","17":"What is this Swiggy Mumbai?

The delivery parner came but only had the Cup noddles, I asked about the Pepsi and lays, he had no idea about it. He said to ask the customer service. Now I've heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so don't know how to ask, I'm really confused, what do do? How to inform Swiggy? \nDon't take it in the wrong way I didn't ask them to offer anything free, but if you do promse pls do send it really hurts\ud83d\ude2d tagging u\/Swiggy_Official\nHopefully that'll help, and others hopefully won't have to deal with it.

A delivery associate once asked for \\~\u20b9100 (the order was already paid online and was worth more than \u20b9100), and elders ended up giving it. Swiggy, somewhat understandably, didn\u2019t do anything about it. I haven\u2019t ordered on COD since. (to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not)\n2. A delivery associate stopped for fuel, food, and even \"servicing the vehicle\" (which turned out to be a residential complex) while on the way to deliver my order. It took them over an hour to deliver a 3-km order. I initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes. They told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver. A few minutes later, I reported it to Swiggy support, who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate, but it ended up taking another 40. When I later checked the location's screenshot on google maps, it turned out to be a residential place, not a \"garage\" as they claimed, likely a stop to eat. On their way from the house, they also stopped at a fuel station. In the end, no compensation was provided for the delay.\n\nMinor issues-\n\n* Torn packages, with food intact\n* Food tossed around inside the packaging (especially desserts)\n* Leaking food (happened only once)\n* Order will be delivered on an \"EV\" ;but delivered on a Splendor\n* Having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nRestaurants, however, have much more to improve on-\n\n* Ignoring common cooking instructions (e.g \"don\u2019t make spicy\", \"don\u2019t add curry leaves\", etc)\n* Delivering incorrect items, including missing customized add-ons (e.g sour cream for tacos) or ingredients listed for the dish (e.g, no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed). For the second instance (no veggies...) no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability.\n* Sending bad items (e.g., burnt, stale, cold, or poorly presented food) while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether.\n* Taking many minutes to accept an order- a new scam on Swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the on-time guarantee (e.g., if the guarantee is 20 minutes, a 15-minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes, as the timer starts only after acceptance, zeroing their liability for delays).\n* Reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price, some joins have extreme markups for online platforms.\n* Excessive packaging charges (e.g., \u20b930-100 on a \u20b9200 order), making discounts pointless at some joints\n* Adding GST on top of GST-inclusive items\n* Providing less quantity than advertised (e.g., 300g listed, but 220g delivered, including packaging; the aggregator (Swiggy\/Zomato) usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported)\n* Misleading pictures that don\u2019t represent the delivered product (one of the earliest \"scams\")\n* Improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy (some people reportedly get refunds for this, but I\u2019ve never tried)\n* Cancelled orders due to \"unavailable items\", which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time (an hour in my case, but made available without the offers), yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts.\n\nDiscount inconsistencies-\n\n* Discounts from some restaurants vary wildly, e.g 60% off most days, but only 30% or lower on random days. This seems to balance ordering, ratings, and revenue. If unaware; people recommend such joints to friends, who then order with significantly worse discounts.\n* A few restaurants with good reviews seem to \"pump and dump,\" offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days, later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews. New\/ uninformed customers, unaware of prior discounts, continue ordering; although in smaller numbers than previously, but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings.\n\nBonus-  \nI\u2019ve had three instances where the order was marked as \"arrived at location\" much earlier than it was actually delivered on Swiggy. In all three cases, I was asked to provide an OTP. I\u2019m curious what this means for delivery guarantees; does it count as \"arrived at location\" for those even if the driver is far from the location?\n\nI almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays. What do you guys rate?\n\nNext up, I'll cover instamart and platform issues (of which there are many)","20":"Flipkart minutes  Everyone who's living in virar+nalasopara West should order from flipkart minutes as cheaply and more 99+ free delivery not like 199+ from blinkit, and fuck someone tell me why zepto and instamart is not working in nsp west","21":"Revamping My Wallet: Experience of applying new cards (HDFC, ICICI, SBI) After many years, I decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet. I've used various cards in the past, including HSBC, HDFC, and Amex, but I canceled most of them around 2019, keeping only one HDFC and Citibank card for increased financial discipline. My main card is the HDFC Regalia Gold. As an Imperia customer, I purposely keep the credit limit 'limited' and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f. The Citi card moved to Axis, which I use as my 'beat-up card' in places where I'm not comfortable using the premium card, keeping its limit below 1L. So, just these 2 cards and all the points go to Regalia gold and use in Smartbuy for all my guilt spends, flights etc\n\nRecently noticed that, I need an ICICI card, SBI card as these are preferred by many e-comm sites for discounts.\n\n**My Details:**\n\n* **Credit Score:**\u00a0835 (Experian), 844 (CRIF) as per CRED\n* **Current Credit Cards:**\u00a0HDFC Regalia Gold, Axis Rupay (UPI enabled)\n* **Annual ITR (last 3 years):**\u00a0Avg INR 80L+\n\n**SBI Cashback Card:**\u00a0(Got *Rejected!*)\n\nBeing an SBI customer for over two decades with a Platinum profile, I saw a 'pre-approved' credit card offer on the online SBI site. After logging in, I completed the online application and KYC using Digilocker data. Despite receiving an email from Aadhar confirming successful KYC, the SBI card site didn't respond. The next day, an SBI card agent called, and someone came to my address for KYC. After filling out a paper form and taking my picture, the KYC was done. However, my application was later rejected. Being in the top 0.1% of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by SBI\u2014guess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club! Now I understand the grin on MS Dhoni's face when he says  \"Jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\"\ud83d\ude06\n\n**HDFC Swiggy Card:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nI applied for this card through HDFC net banking. The online KYC process was smooth, with no physical verification needed. I received the HDFC Swiggy Cashback card in 3-4 days. Since we order a lot on Swiggy, Instamart, and Zomato, this card will replace my other cards for online transactions.\n\n**ICICI HPCL Super Saver:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nWith no prior relationship with ICICI, I applied for this card directly on their site. I chose this card because I spend around 6-7K monthly on HPCL fuel. ICICI cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to HDFC. The application process was smooth, with an option for Video KYC. Despite some initial issues with browser compatibility, the KYC was completed successfully using Google Chrome. The application was approved the next day, and I received the card in 3 days. I promptly disabled Chrome afterward!\n\n**Learnings**:\n\n1. **Digital Efficiency**: HDFC stands out for its smooth, fully online process, setting a benchmark for digital efficiency.\n2. **Customer Experience**: ICICI's process was also efficient, though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues. Their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3. **Service Gaps**: SBI needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses, the overall experience has been enlightening. It's clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customer-centric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process.","22":"The universe always seems to find a way...

Lately, I've been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to LULU for groceries, thinking their veggies are of better quality. We can't just ignore local vendors, even if they are overpriced and assume they don't provide quality. I\u2019ve compared prices and found that local groceries are about +\/- 70 rupees cheaper\/more expensive. Considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies, how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately?\n\nIt's not just about the money. My biggest concern is, why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries? Don't say we don't only go for groceries, many people does this. We're wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic. The traffic and parking at LULU are overcrowded. Is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall, only to find there\u2019s not even enough space to sit? Who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries? Don't ask  are you buying from Online(Amazon,Flipkart) or Offline. I find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality. I'm just saying, only Groceries DO NOT BUY GROCERIES AT LULU, SPENDING YOUR TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY\u2014IT IS A TOTAL WASTE.\n\nCan anyone prove that LULU's vegetables are better? They are super duper expensive, and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop. How can a local street vendor compete against these BIG BIG SUPERMARKETS daily? Some people say that's why Swiggy Instamart is there to support these vendors, but that's another topic for debate.\n\nCan anyone start a delivery business like Swiggy Instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes, with competitive rates compared to these giants? Let's say, Swiggy at 120, LULU at 110, and Amazon Fresh at 115. We offer 120 + 20 for delivery as well, plus if you subscribe, we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription. It can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors. Nowadays, no one can escape ratings and reviews\u2014it's competition in itself. So, vendors won't send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business.","25":"How many of you are using Big Basket? So recently I bought vegetables from Big basket and they were of really good quality.I was casually talking to the delivery guy about how they are performing here in TVM. My assumption was average performance, as even in my apartment I only see Instamart deliveries every time. To my surprise he said they are performing really well, achieved this years target in the first half itself and their June performance was better than Kochi region Big basket. So to my question how many of TVM Redditors are using BB? ","26":"Delivery apps analysis What are your thoughts on quality and cost: Amazon Fresh vs Blinkit vs Swiggy Instamart vs BigBasket vs Zepto?\n\nI was ordering groceries today and had some free time, so I did a quick comparison of these services. Wanted to get everyone\u2019s views and experiences\u2014how do you find the quality and cost across these apps? Any favorites or ones you avoid? Feel free to add others if I\u2019ve missed any good ones.\n\nMy analysis: cost perspective (best to worst)\n\n1. Amazon fresh\n2. Zepto\n3. Swiggy\n4. Blinkit\n5. Big basket\n\nThese were packed items, so quality would be same.","28":"Jiomart now delivers in 20-30 mins in Mangalore Just tried a couple of times received the orders in less than 20 mins that too with good discounts. But minimim order value for free delivery is 249rs. Another alternative to swiggy instamart in mangalore.\n","29":"How can I get chicken breast\/thighs home delivered in Patna? I have moved to Patna for a month. Im on a weight loss journey and need to eat high protein meals. Theres no blinkit or swiggy instamart here. BBNow doesnt have fresh chicken most of the time. Is there a reliable meat shop near Raja Bazaar that can specifically home delivery chicken breast or thighs?","30":"Shoudl we buy Swiggy in unlisted market? Karan Johar, Rahul Dravid, Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit invested in Swiggy.  \n  \nWhat are you waiting for?  \n  \nMe: \u201cMeaningful information to take a call.\u201d  \n  \nInformation 1: Swiggy IPO is a mix of fresh issue of equity shares totaling to \u20b93,750 crore and an offer-for-sale of 18.52 crores equity shares by existing shareholders.  \n  \nMeaning: Roughly 60% of IPO investors\u2019 money will be used to give an exit to the VCs like such as Accel, Prosus, and Tencent. Only 40% will be used by the company for it's operations.  \n  \nInformation 2: Swiggy reduced its losses to \u20b92,350 crore in FY 24, down 43% from last year.  \n  \nMeaning: It's a loss-making company and looks like it will continue to be making losses for some more time.  \n  \nInformation 3: \u20b9559.1 crore of the fresh issue will be used for setting up dark stores  \n  \nMeaning: It's betting big on quick commerce. As per THE KEN, Swiggy instamart is the slowest in delivery time and the average order value is almost the same as Zepto and BB Now. Blinkit is way ahead of it in all parameters. So somewhere needed there.  \n  \nSummary: Pre IPO investing is generally a difficult call. It's got a 50:50 chance. I am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets.  \n  \nIf you found this post useful, share it with your friend.","32":"Consumer Apps used by Delhities I am just curious to know any new consumer app I may not be using but its worth using.\n\nLet me share what I use currently on regular basis ( Each app in each category is in order of most used to least used but usage changes based on discounts and offers offered by each app)\n\nGrocery-  Big Basket (regularly, as low price and less quantity packing available for many items), Otipy (for milk delivery),  Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Country Delight (sometimes for dosa batter , milk etc.)\n\nMedicines (for mom)- Trumeds(offers most discounts in recent times 20-25%), Sayacare (for genereic medicines as they check each batch of medicines), Pharmeasy( sometimes gives 25-30% discount), Netmeds, 1mg (least discount giving app known ever),\n\nHealth test- Healthian (using from long time), Redcliff (when offer more discount)\n\nShopping(Gadgets, clothes, other misc items)- Amazon (I trust it most),  Flipkart (mostly when gadget is flipkart exclusive, their CS is horrible), Pitshirts{dot}com (for good quality budget t shirts and shorts).\n\nTransport- DMRC Momentum 2.0 (for buying and using metro multi journey qr code), Uber (I trust it most), Rapido (when uber does not find ride), Ola (when all apps fail ), Blusmart (they charge premium but theek hai kabhi kabhi ke liye), Chartr (for dtc bus ticket), Indrive ( kabhi kabhi) Namma Yatri (as a last last resort),\n\nSarkaari Apps- MCD 311 (for complaining for cleaning in society), MCD app( for flat registration, used once only),,\n\nFood- Zomato, swiggy ( although I have reduced their usage, bkl itna mehenge dete hai ab sab kuch , mai khud dukkan se le aata hu)\n\nFinance Apps - Upi apps (Gpay, Phonpe, and Paytm), Cred (for credit card payment, overrated but theek hai ab kaun change karein)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPls share ur list or atleast the uncommon apps so I discover some new apps.","33":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Sep 2nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants, raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","34":"Please rate my High level design for Instamart\/Zepto\/Blinkit Hi Guys, I'm practicing for System Design Interviews and created a HLD for Instamart\/Blinkit. Please review it and suggest some points. I'm open for a feedback. Thanks.\n\nFollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n[https:\/\/excalidraw.com\/#json=Unf0TAY9pQ6y5Qjv2HiNF,qqVqRP37oSfrZGmIQSdgKw](https:\/\/excalidraw.com\/#json=Unf0TAY9pQ6y5Qjv2HiNF,qqVqRP37oSfrZGmIQSdgKw)\n\n# \n\nThe user first makes a request for products. A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","35":"8 Best Food Delivery Apps in Bangalore to Satisfy Your Cravings\n Looking for [**food delivery in Bangalore**](https:\/\/appruckus.com\/popular-apps\/best-food-delivery-apps-in-bangalore\/)? then Check out the top 8 Best food delivery apps in Bangalore for fast and delicious meals anytime!\n\nBangalore has a vibrant food delivery scene with several popular apps that offer diverse options, from local eateries to premium restaurants.

Swiggy\n\n* **Why**: Swiggy is one of the most popular food delivery apps in Bangalore, offering a wide range of cuisines, from local favorites to international delicacies. It\u2019s known for fast delivery, a variety of restaurant choices, and Swiggy Genie, which allows you to send or pick up items.\n* **Unique Features**: Real-time tracking, Swiggy Super subscription (offering free deliveries and discounts), and options for groceries and essentials through Swiggy Instamart.\n\n# 2. Zomato\n\n* **Why**: Zomato provides extensive options with menus, photos, and customer reviews to help you decide. It also offers Zomato Pro, a membership for discounts on deliveries and dine-in options at select restaurants.\n* **Unique Features**: User ratings and reviews, Zomato Pro for discounts, and a Zomato Gold membership for additional dine-in benefits.\n\n# 3. Dunzo\n\n* **Why**: Dunzo is known for its \u201cpick up and drop\u201d services, which include delivering groceries, medicines, and other essentials, along with food from local restaurants. It\u2019s great for people who need on-demand delivery beyond food.\n* **Unique Features**: All-purpose delivery service, including groceries, medicine, and custom tasks like picking up laundry or documents.\n\n# 4. Uber Eats (Note: Discontinued in India)\n\n* **Why**: While Uber Eats had a strong presence in Bangalore, it was acquired by Zomato in India in early 2020. However, it's worth mentioning if you\u2019re familiar with it from other locations as its services are now integrated with Zomato.\n\n# 5. Amazon Food (Limited Service)\n\n* **Why**: Amazon Food, available only in select areas in Bangalore, provides discounts and is integrated with Amazon Prime for added benefits. Although its reach is still limited, it\u2019s known for competitive prices and quality control.\n* **Unique Features**: Competitive pricing, integrated with Amazon Prime benefits, and hygiene-focused packaging.\n\n# 6. FreshMenu\n\n* **Why**: FreshMenu specializes in freshly-prepared meals with daily rotating menus, focused on quality and variety. It\u2019s ideal for trying new, healthy meals rather than ordering from restaurants.\n* **Unique Features**: In-house chef-prepared meals, curated daily menus, and health-conscious options.\n\n# 7. Bigbasket (for groceries)\n\n* **Why**: While not strictly a food delivery app for ready-to-eat meals, Bigbasket delivers groceries and essentials to your doorstep. It\u2019s widely used in Bangalore for fresh produce, packaged foods, and everyday essentials.\n* **Unique Features**: Wide range of grocery items, scheduled delivery, and monthly subscription for free delivery.\n\nEach app offers distinct features, so you can use them according to your preferences, whether it\u2019s fast delivery, local foods, discounts, or special grocery deliveries.\n\n","36":"Opinion on the service offered by bigbasket\/blinkit\/instamart etc.? How was the service? Are the fruits and vegetables are selected properly before delivery? I want to try bigbasket. Anything to keep in mind before ordering. Do they accept UPI at the time of delivery?","37":"Need advice-Swiggy tips I use Swiggy a lot both food and particularly Swiggy instamart,\nIam living alone for the time being,  studying for IT, I used to give tips 20 or 30 and water, in the beginning a lot, but since I used it a lot it was adding up, I decided to stop tipping, got a maid for house, Swiggy food I was using less.\n\ntoday\u2019s I ordered 9 tender coconut, cause it\u2019s hot, and got it delivered, I picked it up from porch and took into Kichen, gave the bag back, the guy ridiculed and told me, why no tips for chai or something, since it was the heaviest pack he had. Also be aware, it takes less than 8 min for the guy get here from Swiggy warehouse.\n\nI told him I use the service and have taken subscriptions for free delivery and is already paying a premium.\nI use the platform too much to tip all the time. Since he pushed for tips and kinda insisted Iam not sure\n\nI was considering weather to tip him from phone, once I go back in, now not sure.\n\nFyi:keep in mind as an NRI, I get asked for money daily, from neighbors to friends, to relatives to shop owners to who ever the f I run by, so Iam practicing saying no also., if I don\u2019t give, a guilt trip is usually there.\n\nWhat\u2019s ur thoughts \n\n","38":"Instamart fleet management driven by Swiggy's greed Swiggy fleet is managed in two ways: one way for instamart and the other way for food and genie. It is the same person who can be assigned any of the orders. When a food or genie order is placed by the customer, then the delivery partner is assigned who reaches the pick-up location. But, in case of instamart, Swiggy wants the deliveries within 10 minutes, so... guess what happens? The delivery partner is summoned even before you place the order. You might just be visiting the Instamart section with no intention of ordering, or just decided not to order from Instamart for some reason, the delivery partner is already directed towards the Instamart warehouse.  \nThis has happened multiple times with me and happened again today. I was waiting at Instamart for 20 min. Then, they **unassigned** my order. If it was food or genie, I would have gotten some money for waiting, but as it was Instamart (a subsidiary of Swiggy), they save every penny and not pay any wait time. They use **this money** to show the investors that Instamart was a good investment to make.\n\nEven during peak hours and late nights, Instamart deliveries don't pay anything extra. Do y'all pay extra for Instamart deliveries during surge and late nights?","39":"Coupons dump (beauty and others too) Some are expiring in 2 days. Some are only for first time users.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical.

I think an outline of my monthly expenditure that I think I can put on the card(s) would be helpful:\n\n1. Rent- 25k\n2. Groceries- 5k (I have a tiffin service, hence this is low\ud83d\ude2c)\n3. Dining- 8k\n4. Swiggy\/Zomato- 5k\n5. Phone + Subscriptions- 2k (although some are billed annually)\n6. Movies- 2k (tickets+confectionary)\n7. Petrol- 4k\n8. Amazon- 2k\n9. Offline spends- 5k\n\nApart from these expenses, maybe the odd yearly large purchase.\n\nI only have a DCB metal currently (add-on from my brother), and I have been buying vouchers for Swiggy and Amazon, so dining (dineout), groceries (instamart and amazon fresh) and delivery get taken care of this way. Having this card also takes lounge access off my list of priorities needed in the card.\n\nFurthermore, I am eligible for sapphiro through the alumni program, though I am yet to apply for it. For anyone who's applied and gotten it, any tips would be appreciated. (Ques: do I have to be eligible salary-wise as well? What supporting documents do they require?)\n\nI make 1 or 2 trips a year to my hometown, so I was eyeing an airline card too (maybe the Vistara ones, premium economy\/business class tickets do sound very tempting).\n\nI also don't like the idea of paying joining or annual fees. I would like to avoid that as much as possible. I know getting a fyf (subsequently, a waiver after spends) or a ltf card may prove to be difficult but I am looking for suggestions that may eventually offer the possibility at the very least.\n\nApart from this, I think HDFC Swiggy may be a good option. Sorry if this feels all over the place, at the end of the day I just want to maximise the value I can get from my expenses, in any way cashback, points etc. Any and all inputs will be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, I already bank with ICICI and HDFC if that's of any consideration. \n\nThank you for your time.","42":"Swiggy not going Refund Been a week since I talked with them for a delayed delivery (Instamart) - 30 mins were promised and it took 1\u00bd hours for the delivery. While chatting they offered a refund and it still hasn't processed yet, I have talked with the support 3 times from that day any thing I can do ?","43":"SWIGGY INSTAMART delivered items with HARPIC BLEACH all over them ! WARNING AGAINST USING SWIGGY INSTAMART, AND RANT (posting on behalf of a friend in her words) : \n31F booked an order on SWIGGY INSTAMART for several house hold items and FOOD products today for Rs. 2400. Even added a tip for the delivery agent. \n\nI had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofa's armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately. Just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where I unpack groceries, I started to faintly smell BLEACH (Harpic). \n\nI was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as I cut open the top of the bag. Delivery agent was gone by then. There was light\/no wetness on items at the top, but the more I got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items. The bleach smell from the Harpic Bleach (white bottles) fumes I had ordered was very strong, even burning my eyes slightly at this point. \n\n\nI took pictures and sent it on Swiggy Instamart chat. There is a pool of bleach at the bottom. There is even a picture where I lifted the bag up and there's so much bleach on the kitchen counter !!! It leaked through the bag\/holes in it!!\nSWIGGY INSTAMART COMPLEYELY REFUSED TO REPLACE\/REFUND\/EXCHANGE ! \n\n\nMy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point. Checked and found that the spot on my sofa's armrest where I put the bag down while taking the delivery was SOAKED in bleach ! I started to panic-clean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that we're not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical. \n\n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\n\nI offered several solutions : \n1. REVERSE PICKUP ALL ITEMS AND GIVE ME A FULL REFUND. Gurmeet Kaur (supervisor) refused. Why ?? \n2. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OK FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL ITEMS AND REPLACE IT WITH A FRESH ORDER. They didn't even want to speak about solutioning this ! \n3. I asked for an exchange\/full refund of all food products atleast, since bleach can literally hospitalize\/kill you ! She REFUSED !! I had sent 5-7 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said I need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it. I told her you can't see wetness on all products unless it's dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help ???  And I had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and we're getting exposed to it. \n4. Even if there's a chance few other items didn't make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach. Bleach FUMES are enough to contaminate any thing. I would not risk mine or anybody's health by allowing them to eat these items. Basic common sense. I had bought snacks for visiting kids today. But she refused to agree there was even a problem here !! \n5. Not only do I have to throw several of the items I ordered cause they are no longer safe, I also have to clean my counter tops, get rid of all exposed items\/bags into sealed clean bags, I also need to clean my sofa !! I don't even know how to remove bleach from a sofa !! Not to mention bleach will discolour clothes\/fabric !! It's a dark coloured sofa ! \n\n\nSwiggy thinks it's safe for their customers to use\/eat products from the same bag as leaking bleach ! They took zero responsibility for wasting my time, effort (ordering, waiting for delivery, talking to them on chat\/call, and CLEANING THE MESS AND HEALTH HAZARD they caused), my WASTED MONEY or for potentially compromising the health of others like this ! Are these their company's quality of service, standards and principles ??\n\n\nNote - I understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery I easily spend about Rs. 14,000-17,000 per month on their app for years now, very rarely raising issues. \n\n\nLessons learned\/For everybody reading this, \n1. Please don't order toxic or harmful substances like Harpic\/bathroom or toilet cleaners, floor cleaners, drain cleaners, naphthalene balls, dishwashing liquids, etc from SWIGGY INSTAMART since they use flimsy, non-leak proof bags, and don't segregate food items from chemical items while delivering. I will only order groceries from BigBasket from now onwards.\n2. Atleast order food items and other things in SEPERATE ORDERS.\n3. Check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since SWIGGY INSTAMART WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN CASE OF COMPROMISED PRODUCTS.\n4. Take pictures, videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system, or for social media. \n\n\nAm I being unreasonable expecting Swiggy to take responsibility here ? It shocks me that they didn't take any actions to correct such a health hazard ! \nPictures attached (zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom)","44":"Swiggy Disabling Instamart for Swiggy One users I stay in Rai Durg area and swiggy instamart has been inaccessible\/unavailable on my app since few weeks. When I saw a instamart delivery in the apartment, I got really curious as to how the other person must have ordered. \nWent back home, checked on my brothers mobile and it was available. I logged out from my mobile and used my brother's ID which did not have a swiggy one membership and voila, instamart was miraculously delivering to my home. \nTo make things sure, I logged in with my ID on brothers mobile and no instamart services. \nSo now I am pretty sure swiggy is selectively disabling instamart services to Swiggy one subscribers, what a bunch of cheating pricks. I wish I had the time and liberty to sue these guys in court. ","45":"Need opinions on deliveries as a source of side income. (Skip this part if you want it's just the reason) Hey there guys, I'm about to get into college in the following month, since I wasn't able to score enough to get a government college I'll have to go for a private college but I don't want my dad to pay for it, since he is already on the verge or retiring and has a few heart complications, he won't be able to provide for home and my fees soon. So I'm on a hunt to find a method to earn enough to pay off my college fees atleast.\n\nI don't have any skills other than being good at logical reasoning, mathematics and Rubik's Cube, I love teaching too but it's hard to find people of these interests. That's why I decided to go for deliveries.\n\nMy fees may vary between 80k to 1.8L + 2L donation in first year so I'm planning to able to earn atleast 400 per day (12000PM), 500 per day (15000PM) is cool and 800 (24000PM) is just wonderful, I can't ask for more. I'll be able to give my dad the money in installments for my college fees and some for home and ofcourse some for myself as well. So is it possible to earn this much from deliveries?\n\nIf yes which delivery apps, may it be food delivery like swiggy, zomato or instant delivery like Zepto instamart etc.. are the best if I can give 2-3 hours of my time daily and don't require a bike, since I only have a bicycle. I live in western Mumbai if that matters.","47":"Looking for what I should add, remove and continue to keep from my very modest collection A small background about me, I am a 2021 graduate and now I currently make in the 15-20LPA bracket as a salaried employee in MNC. \n\nAfter analyzing my spends over last 2 years of using credit cards, I noticed my monthly expenses on CC ranges between 20-35k and very occasionally reaching 50-60k if I am travelling\/buying a phone\/laptop or some tech. But usually it's 20-35k. And those expenses are mostly swiggy food orders, instamart grocery delivery, dining out, bbinstant (my office has a kiosk) and movie shows mostly.

I have been compiling a few common issues faced by peer Delivery Partners including a few that confronted myself. The DP support is very frustrating. The cos take them for granted despite clearly knowing that DPs are the ones which are actually the breadwinner for the company itself. I admit other business units like Sales and Administration contribute however the indifference to support Delivery Partners is beyond acceptable tolerable limits.  \nA few issues are hereunder:\n\n1. No Monthly Account Statement for Earnings and other Notes. Other than weekly payout notes, Swiggy does not seem to be interested in giving out these. Lack of transparency because at times payout denied and also delayed with unnecessary and irrational debits which there is no efficient grievance redressal team at Swiggy\n2. Swiggy keeps giving Robocalls for notifications through their vendors Exotel despite no explicit OptIn. Reporting to TRAI DND and escalating is of no avail as Exotel keeps calling from different numbers.\n3. Despite during Onboarding they advertise of No Onboarding Fee down the line after a few weeks they debit a steep charge for the same without a rational justification. This is over and above the security deposit as well.\n4. The Instamart at select locations (I confirmed the same at Tambaram Chennai) delays the in-scan of the reusable bags and then if a WARNING is issued regarding non-return they cooly respond a technical error and is covering up.\n5. Refusal to change shifts and hence delay\/denial of incentives. The shift form is cryptic and support is not assisting in changing the same.\n6. Though the incentives do not say about active shift they use it as a hidden condition to avoid giving to Delivery Partners.\n7. More than 100 orders Delivery Partner need to be enrolled in Partner Club. However a number of Delivery Partners remain in open rolls without being tagged into one or more of the Partner Club. A DP support person called me and assured that he will address this issue and add to a Club. However a minute later the ticket was closed with a comment 'No issues found currently'","51":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.

I don't know if this is considered a startup or not but I wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city. I am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app. We already have zomato, swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery. Does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city ? ","56":"Swiggy Instamart is really helpful Sorry for off topic. But I wanted to share this.

But all shops were closed as I searched nearby. Suddenly I got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart. \n\nAnd surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 Rs.

As Swiggy gears up to go public, there are some interesting factors for investors to consider. On one hand, Swiggy has established itself as one of India\u2019s top two food delivery players (alongside Zomato), with a strong user base and brand loyalty. Plus, it's been diversifying with offerings like Instamart (quick commerce) and Swiggy Genie (personalized delivery services), tapping into new markets like rapid grocery delivery.\n\nHowever, Swiggy\u2019s DRHP shows persistent losses since inception and negative cash flow, though it has made recent progress in narrowing those losses. The company still relies heavily on discounts and marketing to retain users, which puts pressure on profit margins. There's also increased regulatory scrutiny on gig workers and potential tax liabilities, which could add to its costs and operational complexities in the future. Furthermore, Swiggy faces strong competition from Zomato and new entrants like the government-backed ONDC, which offers food delivery at significantly lower prices. This puts Swiggy under pressure to innovate and retain its user base while managing costs effectively.\n\nThat said, there are still reasons some investors might find Swiggy attractive. India\u2019s online food delivery and quick-commerce markets are still relatively young, and Swiggy has a solid track record of growth and brand recognition. Its quick-commerce arm, Instamart, is growing fast and could potentially become a profitable segment. Swiggy's ability to diversify beyond food delivery could make it a more resilient and versatile company in the long run.\n\nSo, the big question is whether Swiggy can achieve sustainable profitability and capitalize on its brand and market position, or if ongoing competition and operational challenges will weigh down its performance. What do you think? Are the growth prospects worth the risk?\n\n\n\n","60":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter.

The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping.

The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

With Swiggy\u2019s IPO hitting the stock market tomorrow, I\u2019m curious to know what you all think will happen with its listing performance. Here are some points being discussed in the market:\n\n1. Valuation Concerns: Some analysts are saying Swiggy might be overvalued compared to its peer, Zomato, given its current financials and recent growth strategy focused on quick commerce. Are we looking at another Paytm-like situation, or will it surprise us?\n\n\n2. Growth Potential vs. High Cash Burn: Swiggy has been aggressive with growth, expanding beyond food delivery into Instamart and other quick commerce areas. But we all know the cash burn rate is steep, which could impact its profitability in the long run. Will this expansion help with a strong listing day, or do you think it could backfire due to sustainability concerns?\n\n\n3. Market Sentiment and IPO Fever: Given the current market conditions, will retail investors flock to it for short-term gains, or are people going to be more cautious, given the volatility of recent tech IPOs?\n\n\n4. Possible Listing Pop or Drop? With the price band set between INR 371-390, do you think it will list at a premium, or could we see it dip on debut day? We\u2019ve seen some IPOs do exceptionally well post-listing, while others have struggled initially before stabilizing.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your gut feeling? Planning to hold or flip if you got an allotment?","64":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 29th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n___\n\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce, emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against ReviewServiceUSA.com for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","65":"Starting to see the end of affordable grocery delivery apps? Came on here after hearing and seeing Zepto's plan to become profitable. I'm starting to see rs. 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members. This could be across India, but I'm seeing it already here in Bengaluru where lots of people order groceries. Even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs. 599 which isn't something I'll be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase. Seems to me that if this starts making them enough money, other apps will follow. Zepto is currently the only one without big backing - blinkit has zomato, bigbasket has tata, instamart has swiggy, and milkbasket has reliance, and they're facing difficulty in getting funding, but seems to me like I'd rather go to a grocery store now, where I can get better discounts, which I've been doing since they've started rolling this out. \n\nIs it just me? Or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes? Is the market too saturated with choices? \n\nWhat do you all think? How popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here? \n\nEdit: I was born and brought up in Bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown. For urgent needs I've always gone to the local store next to my apartment, or other stores nearby. However, when I'm coming back home late at night after work around 9-10, I've been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like Zepto. I'm saying it's a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible. That's what I meant. ","66":"Swiggy has released its FY24 results (Unlisted Share)\n **Revenue and Profitability:**\u00a0Swiggy has demonstrated strong financials ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The Bengaluru-based firm reported a 33% jump in its revenue to Rs 11,634 crore in FY24 from Rs 8,714 crore in FY23. Swiggy has also managed to reduce its losses by 44% to Rs 2,350 crore in the last fiscal year.\u00a0\n\n**Business Growth:**\u00a0Swiggy said that its food delivery business grew 17% to Rs 6,100 crore while its quick commerce vertical Instamart registered Rs 1,100 crore gross revenue in the last fiscal year. When compared, Zomato's overall revenue in FY24 jumped 71% to Rs 12,114 crore. This includes Rs 6,161 crore from the food business and Rs 2,301 crore via the grocery business, Blinkit. Swiggy was neck and neck with Zomato in terms of food delivery whereas it was behind in terms of grocery business.\n\n**Business Prospects:**\u00a0Swiggy's consumer-facing business comprising food delivery, Instamart, and dining recorded a total gross order value (GOV) of Rs 35,000 crore driven by its 14.3 million monthly transacting users. Continuous improvements in contribution margin across segments is driven by rising take rates and higher contribution of advertisement revenues, cost optimization, and reduction of discounts. Instamart's rapid expansion was on the back of the increased density of dark stores in existing cities and expansion to new cities.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bki5873mybrd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8032a3245de0ddb97e92383805810ea08ea706\n\n","67":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...  \n___\n\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n\n___\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce (formerly Woo, formerly WooCommerce), emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against [ReviewServiceUSA.com](http:\/\/ReviewServiceUSA.com) for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate [Alibaba.com](http:\/\/Alibaba.com), the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\n hope you found this recap helpful.

Join free at www.shopifreaks.com","70":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

"},"all_text":{"0":"instamart delivery guy asked for onion bangalore so this is what happened in the evening having discussed with my wife what all grocery we need i order them the delivery guy came to the door on expected time after me greeting him with thanks\nhe said  sir ek pyaaj mil sakta hai kya  \nme  kyu \nhe  aise hi khaane k liye \nme  okayafter getting a pyaaj i asked  koi tantra mantra to nahi karoge na bhaiya \nhe  nahi sirwith innocent smile\n\n\nafter i he left taking the onion me and my wife were discussing if he genuinely needed to eat it or going to do tantra mantra\ud83d\ude02my wife said may be onion is so expensive here he might be asking for onion from every where he delivers so he have enough to make food using it     \ndid any one else has experienced this could anyone tell why he asked for this  poor guys eat roti with onion cant afford vegetables  very sad case\nwhatever his intentions were op i respect you for giving him one onion \ud83d\udc4d\neither he was struggling financially so asked it to eat with roti or he was in a good mood for sunday evening and will have it with chicken and oldmonk or maybe he found someone needy somewhere and give it to them we will never know\nfirst time reading about such a incident maybe chakne ya khaane ke liye liya hoga raat ho gyi hogi jyada\nbhai kisko yaad hai kya purane delhi side 2000s around me rumor tha ki witches ka group hai usme ek  ek witch ghar jaake onion magti hai or jaise hi aap onion dete wo onion ko apne haatho me press karke dabba dete hai or tabhi aapka head bhi

of mine male opposite citi mall andheri west and this swiggy guy who is on an electric bike stops us beckons that he is wanting our time my guard went up while he stopped and parked his bike  now he is showing that his phone is hanging up and has stopped working because of multiple deliveries apparently then he says he is paying the rent of the electric bike and was asking for 400 straight up i didnt even realise how he was asking this amount i didnt understand anything then said he needs penalty amount \n400 is nothing much couldve helped him yes but honestly my gut was taken aback that randomly he is upfront asking me cash he pestered my friend first then when we finally told him didnt have cash and wanted to move ahead he again loudly asks me madam aapke pass hai kya \nnot sure of the new scam or anything but as a woman in mumbai id be even more wary of ordering anything online or just generally delivery partners around on the road or anything safety perspective\nis this like a new scam \nps not looking down on anyone have been thinking about this suspicious behaviour since yesterday ki kya thha bhai wo  they are scammers\n\nnever entertain strangers even for directions they will snatch your phone and run away\npeople tend to shoot their shot and see what happens not saying this particular guy was bluffing or saying the truth but you should always do what your gut tells you\nanybody asking for money in the first conversation itself is a red flag do not listen to what they say they might convince you i tend to make up excuse of getting late to somewhere and skip the small talk\nsimilar think happened to me coincidently over the placed mentioned only a balloon seller asked me for 1 plate momoshe was like bhook lagi hai sir i bought him 1 plate momos but thought to myself that couldve have eaten 1 plate of lunch or dinner in that amount he was around my age only so i felt badand my good consciousness got the better of me\na normal piece of advice anyone who ask for money in public in mumbai usko seedha doh gaali deke bhaga dene ka","2":"a little humanity goes a long way hi i work as a delivery person for instamart around the jayanagar area the hub is located in jayanagar kr road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi jayanagar nr colony srinagar gavipuram  banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nif youre ordering during heavy rains please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged then it falls on the delivery persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n  quick commerceinstant delivery is built on the principles of ultra cheap and readily available labour  this is the reason youd never see this work in us or eu with better equitable distribution of income \n\nthanks op for the honest account kudos to your writing skills\nthanks for this i urge everyone to at least  climb down the stairs or take a lift and collect the orders as we have to collect only one order but the delivery executive has to climb to at least 1520 homes in a day\n\nalso thanks for sharing this i saw a swiggy instamart guy riding his bike absolutely drenched in rain at 10 am this morning and i felt awful \n\nplease ride safe in the rain and stay safe cheers\naaaah\n\nsame old story with delivery gigs jobs everywhere \n\ni really hope you come out of this gutter someday \n\nthe only way this blinkit zepto instamart business survives is by exploiting folks like you \n\ndo not expect this from people ordering most are just grade a trashbags \n\nstay focused on what you will be doing next\nits a privilege really to be able to order at midnight or during rains\nyou are simply asking people to be considerate and thats valid\nif we are ever confused about how to act its simple be kind\nthanks for sharing this","3":"delivery time  the swiggy instamart dark store is quite close to my place 1 min by two wheeler according to google maps\n\n\nthe usual delivery time from that dark store ends up being 4 mins but actually takes 10  15 mins which includes the delivery person most of the times calling me inspite of the address being very clear along with hard to miss landmarks right on the main road \n\n\nbut because they use some kinda radius which they consider to change the status of delivery person as arrived at the location the order is always marked as arrived at my location even before it leaves the dark store potentially as soon as its packed \n\n\ni dont really mind the order coming in 10  15 mins or even more than that also it only gets marked as delivered after the order is in my hand so that not an issue but the time it considers is that initial 23 mins\n\n\nsuch metrics can and are definitely skewing the overall statistics they present\n\nwhy are they registering such skewed metrics or is it just how the app is made to function what do youll think about it\n\n deleted","5":"indias grocery wars a

ambitions of tataowned bigbasket and flipkart before they take off\n\n\ud83d\udd38 flipkart is fresh with funds from google and majority stakeholder walmart and is also likely to make a major push for

be grossly wrong but your critical comments are welcome below is table of orders process by blinkit taken from various sources\n\nwith 5l orders per day and value per order rs 640 gross order value per q in crs is rs 2880 crs against the company claim of 4950 cr\n\n\n\ngross order value per quarter in crores is far below the claim made by company value per order and orders per day are taken from economic times report and annual report but hings dont add up\n\nalso number of delivery partners and total deliveries in a day dont add up\n\non top of this cofounder of zomato is wife of blinkit ceo and she has resigned today further in 2 years the company turned from 1200 cr loss to 351 cr profit with the same business model and nominal increase in charges platform fee revenue is 180 cr only so that has not impacted profitability\n\nfor sure something big is cooking up as all the cofounders are leaving\n\nkindly share your views\n\n\n\n \nif you havent already please add your own

operating activities and profit doesnt go hand in hand\n\nmy take is their income comes from investing actives which in turn makes their balance sheet look positive \n\n\ni shared this with my friends and they just said that their blink it business is booming and hence their bl looks great which further affects their stock price positively but i just cant wrap my head around it kuch gadbad hai \n\ni am soooo happy someone else also feels that theres something heavily wrong with zomato \n\nmein akele pagal nahi hoon\never since they posted adjusted ebidta ive steered away from the company\nalso a huge chunk of their revenue comes from hyperpure have you factored in that thats around 27 of zomatos total revenue\nfor some reason i have never not good vibes from deepinder goyal obv this is a random statement but over the years i have realised that our gut instinct is generally right","7":"will these quick delivery apps like blinkit and zepto survive longterm so i run a marketing company and was talking with a client about these quick commerce apps like blinkit instamart zepto and all right now theyre spending lots of money on free deliveries cashbacks and discounts to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free delivery\nhere to stay but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other channels highly possible that we will see more logistics companies coming up soon to deliver locally for restaurants mncs directly instead of working with q commerce","8":"airtel axis scam fuck axis  hey everyone im dealing with an ongoing issue with my airtel axis credit card and wanted to see if anyone here has faced something similar or could offer advice i was approved for the card in july but since then i havent received the correct cashback based on the cards cashback policy ive raised the issue multiple times but my requests were closed without a satisfactory resolution\n\nhere are the details\n\nfirst month i spent about 2500 on swiggy but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountbut based on my calculations i should have received 640\n\nswiggy transactions issue some swiggy food delivery transactions are being categorized as instamart orders which likely use a different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed not everythings a scam dude its kind of normal even when the cashback credited is lower than expected they credit it in later statements\n\n\n\nscreenshot from my expense management app look at the entries with additional cashback  monthyear\n\ncashback would get credited in statement as cashback  monthyear additionalmissing cashback as additional cashback  monthyear\n\nif you notice sometimes additional cashback came months after the statement date\n\nedit seems this post is for the rupay variant i cant say whats up with that\nhey this happened the first two months with me too i kept raising complaints and not talking to the first level of customer care but escalating to the next one eventually they corrected it after almost two months i checked for transactions for 3 months since and it was all okay i havent checked again for the last 6 months and now i feel like i should check again\ndude\n\nbeen facing the same issue i have called and emailed customer care multiple times yet a resolution has not been reached service requests have been raised till now\n\nreally frustrating and disappointing experience i thought i was the only one facing this problem\nput on the email here brothers i guess i am gonna need it coz after watching this i will have to calculate mine as well\nthis is an issue with swiggy they alternatively use the mccs interchangeably i have been seeing this issue for last 2 years","9":"no delivery after 12 am a few days ago a few policemen beat up one of the zomato rider near prem nagar this isnt in the news because this wasnt reported but it has happened if a zomato rider comes to your doorstep please ask them about it there was even a strike by around 100150 zomato delivery partners near it park thats where zomatos office is\n\nand this new rule by the dm says no delivery partner to be available after 12 am is bullshit\n\ni run a cloud kitchen and i used to do this at night thats when i get all my orders but now its all zero how do i pay my bills and the vendors\n\npeople with zero experience and ground knowledge call shots for the rest of us  how is this not attacking our democracy\n\nthe police comes and takes bribes from almost every restaurant and now only a select few are open unofficially after 12 am outlets like gaylord is operational and doing their own delivery  but the police isnt questioning them there are barricades and police check points at clock tower gaylord had their lights turned on all and the police knew but no one questioned them \n\nthese rules dont matter to the ones who are connected i guess\n\nim just mad at the local government for putting a band aid on the whole situation just to save their skin after the whole incident that happened theyll do everything except catch the actual culprits  people who drink and drive\n\nlast night there was checking at ballupur the car in front of us had no number plates the police stopped the car checked the trunk and let them go same with us wheres alcometer why were those guys not questioned driving without number plates is illegal\n\nzomato swiggy blinkit instamart  everything closes down  and the city feels dead it feels like im back in 2021 when there were no restaurants available and this is affecting small outlets like mine delivery partners who used to work full time on zomato at night and people who order every day after the night shift approach court violation of fundamental rights may be applied on this\nuttarakhand is fucked up state\nzomato strike happened on tuesday next to iksana\ni think when accident wala mamla will be forgotten local govt will also remove such bars\nabhi order kar raha tha bc we cant take order right now aa gaya\n\nstupid government and even more stupid and coward people including me","10":"this food delivery is super expensive zomato swiggy all are on hypergrowth mode they are doing good generating good revenue and also they are generating employment but what is not good\n\nzomato is trading at about 180 ttm pe it is about 9 times the nifty so if gdp is growing at 8 to sustain its valuation it need to grow at 30 every year and yes it is growing\n\nnow lets read the fineprint  swiggy is a total wonder it is still burning cash\n\nparticularsfy22fy23fy24\n\nrevenue5704 crore8264 crore11247 crore\nnet loss3628 crore4179 crore2350 crore\n\nit looks amazing that loss is reducing and they are about to reach profitability having staggering 11247 crore revenue the issue is market cap which is crossing 1 lakh crore that too on zero profit generally loss making companies are valued at 2x revenue max 4x but it is whopping 9x revenue multiple\n\neven in recent q2  it did well 30 yoy growth at loss of 6255 crore\n\nbut when you look at qoq it is a different story\n\nloss widened from 611 crore to 625 crore revenue rose 1177 from 3322 to 3601 crore but fineprint is it came on back of very heavy competitive quick commerce business instamart food delivery business grown qoq at 4 which is very concerning it means food delivery revenue is flattened this quarter\n\nconsidering 80 weightage to food business in valuation  ebit of 122 crore then also it is 250300 pe higher than zomato zomato profit is five times they said will take 2 more years to be profitable why\n\nthats why i keep on saying extremely high pe means very high risk again it is not recommendations it is how you analyze the fine print number wrapped into big big business reports people will try to use different stories and rationale to justify why their massive growth stock is worth 1 lakh crore or 25 lac crores but investing in such companies at these valuation is juat plain stupid imo especially when its a loss making business or a company that makes a good chunk of its net profits through other income or exceptional items and interest payment\ntheir most profitable business is not going to be food delivery they will figure out another way to monetize data maybe via advertising\n\nthe data they have is tremendous what type of people order what type of food at what time that data can be used in many other ways for qsr or fmcg business\nvaluation ka nai malum lekin zomato  swift is the future because of the convenience they offer\npositive cash flow is like oxygen for any business entity they have a negative cash flow back to back fy on the profit part i guess due to intense competition between the red team and orange team increasing their platform fee could mean loosing market share it could end in two ways either both of these form themselves into a duopoly just like how it happened in telecom space or they continue to loose money till the business itself becomes unsustainable and the investors loose confidence

like i may get much benefit from them due to minspend criterias eg infinia has something like 68l min spends in a year other cards are basic i believe correct me if im wrong\n\n3 icici \n   best mobile experience\n   ref \n\n\n\ni did not look into other i also heard great about hsbc premier\n\nmostly im confused between idfc  hdfc im not sure if hdfc credit cards are worth it and what spend level should i have to look into that\n\nim mostly new into corporate graduating next year had been doing intern for last 6m got offer for next 6m too\n\n\n\nalso im open to other suggestions too this is just my findings let me know if im missing something too hdfc best so eventually when you have high spends you can get a decent cc\n\nmillenia is a good enough cc to start with\n\nicici is good if you dont care about cc  experience is great\ndo try sbi corporate salary package accounts\njust a heads up you cannot open a salary account in any bank until your company has a tie up with them and most of the it companies i have seen have tieup with icici andor hdfc and if your company has no tie up it will be a savings account\n\ni assumed you might yet not know this tieup thing because you were checking for multiple banks salary accounts and companies dont usually have so many options for opening an account\nicici if you ask me i was immediately offered platinum card once the salary account was opened and 3 months later i applied for apay icici and approved then 3 months later again was offered ltf sapphiro and coral rupay ltf and now they are offering icici emeralde paid one all happened in less than 10 months and my cc limit initially was 30k  1l  46l  5l and now its 138l even i was surprised by their generocity\nyou can open in hdfc for the cc you can get a pretty decent card like millenia and keep it instead of upgrading to infinia if it does not suit you i have a millenia and would not upgrade unless it is ltf","12":"please dont give your phone to myntra delivery

delivery driver itll be given separately they are saying no its from the same form when explained that delivery rating is separate from myntra rating theyre unable to explain themselves and saying no its the same its not \n\n\nif youre ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them right it has happened with me several times with even zomato instamart zepto etc \n\nso i thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback but the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of myntra not the delivery executive \n\nhe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail i told him i wont because i do not want to rate myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and thats all they should care about \n\nplease dont give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service if yes tell them you can do that on app and dont let them rate it for you \n by reading the title i thought the delivery guy took the phone and ran off\ni told the delivery person that i dont get feedback emails and messages from myntra when he asked me for it he then requested me to give him a high rating  if i get any feedback form which i dont mind as hes been delivering for almost 5 years\nbro eatsure always did it

was getting it for 362 even\ngo check the resturant menu and you will be crying","14":" found price differences across grocery delivery apps  building a solution  so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can do it and using ai could even make it better but its difficult to monetize lots of companies have failed to do such things and pivoted into other ideas\n\nthe puzzle to crack here is monetization the feature in itself can be built easily","15":"is it just me or have the delivery services significantly degraded in the past month average order times have gone up to 4550 mins ive had to cancel deliveries because no agent was found for upto 90 mins instamart blinkit and zepto seem to have stopped services after midnight zomatos pricing is madness unless you select the 19 rupee priority delivery your order will take an hour  edited comment from earlier\n\nthe services provided by delivery companies has more marginal cost than what we are pay because vcs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden quick refunds more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup\n\nmany vcs now know that the market size for these services in india is small so vc funding is drying up to remain alive these companies now need to become profitable for that they need to try and extract that marginal cost this can be through\n\n1 smaller fleets to reduce cost this causes delivery times to go up\n2 bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size this again causes delivery times to go up\n3 asking extra money if bunching isnt opted by customers\n4 saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons this causes customer support quality to go down extra checks on claims asking for pics emails etc\n5 increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue\n6 hiking prices on subscriptions because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service it is counter intuitive but true\n\nthe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies i use swiggy and bbinstant a lot it has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak\nthey are grouping order nowadays in last 34 months ive had delivery person going in opposite direction coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls trying to search through my order in their bag turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me\u00a0\nat least blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem their warehouse is very close to my apartment less than 500 meters and folks are sitting idle on their bikes usually but when i try to order on app it says over 2 hours due to high transactions\nyeah they are getting worse \n\nwatch this videoenshittification\nthey is different between business and startup these quick commerce are dependence business its involves multiple things in business \nthey tell they will be profitable of some year after burning 1000s of crores with 12 crore and at that new players comes to be honest long run business are not built like these","17":"what is this swiggy mumbai swiggy promised me two items as freegifts along with the order didnt send it dont know if its the correct subreddit but i trust this subreddit a little too much so am posting here few hours age i was at college was extremely hungry and college canteen doesnt have good food by the time were free all the canteen food is already finished i resently downloaded swiggy  have seen swiggy delivery partners many times in college so ordered on swiggy was craving cup noodles so ordered cup noodles on instamart  ordered 4 cup noodles to take home for my family to taste and one for me there it showed ill get free lays and pepsi with it it sounded great would get to get full without stressing the pocket much the delivery parner came but only had the cup noddles i asked about the pepsi and lays he had no idea about it he said to ask the customer service now ive heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so dont know how to ask im really confused what do do how to inform swiggy \ndont take it in the wrong way i didnt ask them to offer anything free but if you do promse pls do send it really hurts\ud83d\ude2d tagging uswiggyofficial\nhopefully thatll help and others hopefully wont have to deal with it i downloaded swiggy resently and really hope to have the best experience with you you should thank your stars atleast the cup noodles got deliveredmaine ek baar baby bottleguard order kia tha aur mila baby dudu bottle\ud83d\udc80\ninstamart should be your worst case scenario try using blinkit or zepto 5 litre milk order kiya tha usme se 3 litre expires tha\ncontact them via the app\nthis is too common i have been told by their customer service that freebies are given only as per availability or stockif there is no stock then why add it to my cart lol also this happened during covid  sometimes they do send the freebies but delivery partners steal them customer service is not helpful in these cases also\ntried instamart once i had ordered chips coke and fews icecreams got the notification that it is delivered but i did not receive it i called the delivery guy he was rude and said that he delivered it to someone and now its not his responsibility he did not even check whether it was me like atleast ask for the name or crosscheck or something \nhad to call the helpdesk 3 times for them to initiate another delivery and even then there were no icecreams so called them again and just told them to refund the amount of the icecreams all of this took more than 3 hours now i use zepto and always opt for pay on delivery","19":"delivery and restaurant scams on swiggyzomato the most delivery associates ask for is a rating but over the years and across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many never order cod if the person ordering is not present to take the order delivery guys deliberately ask for more if elderly people receive the order and they may also shout and threaten elderly if they dont pay up immediately have read so many cases about this\nfake images in listings is not a swiggy scam you dont get shah rukh khan with lux and juhi chawla with taaza people know this for ages\n\npump and dump is a term used for an actual fraud what you are describing is a legit way how business works","20":"flipkart minutes  everyone whos living in virarnalasopara west should order from flipkart minutes as cheaply and more 99 free delivery not like 199 from blinkit and fuck someone tell me why zepto and instamart is not working in nsp west after sometime they will also make it 199 \nits just a start up strategyblinkit did the same \ninstamart and zepto dont have funding like zomato backed blinkit \nblinkit works here\nflipkart minutes is so good but the annoying delivery guys always ask to do upi even tho i opt for cod i give them change as well which they have to unwillingly accept i so want instamart to work in virar","21":"revamping my wallet experience of applying new cards hdfc icici sbi after many years i decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet ive used various cards in the past including hsbc hdfc and amex but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process just one question with an 80l  annual income  why are you applying for cards like swiggy hdfc instead of just upgrading your regalia gold to infinia \nim more interested to know what you do for a living\ncrif  exeperian are secondary primarily only cibil is checked by the banks\nit seems like you ownrun a business banks prefer salaried employees in comparison with business people even if business people file for higher itr \n\n  \nanyways what the your 3 major spend category or maybe tell us platform \n\n  \nbut in general i will recommend you hsbc live 10 on zomato dining in and dmart 15 all other but ignore if you only use swiggy since you already have hdfc swiggy amazon icic or axis fk depending on the platform you shop from kotak myntra if you shop from myntra axis airtel if you have airtel broadband or sim \n\n  \nso with the card you already have and if you add any of the above mentioned cards you have covered lounge access amazon or fk shoppping food deliverydine in utility payments myntra shopping 5 on most online spents using swiggy card upi card groceries shopping at dmart and miscellaneous offline payments\n1 an 80l earner preferring minor cashback over major rewards seems counterintuitive  \n2 to experience a better version of sbi apply for their aurum comes with great lifestyle benefits  \n3 your icici card is a cobranded one these often dont get the respective discounts that the core cards get","22":"the universe always seems to find a way ivvala oka vichithram jarigindhi folks

lulu mall  i live more than 10 kilometers away from lulu mall but i still visit it once a week either on weekends or weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business people dont visit lulu just for groceries its a weekend outing for them when they go to lulu\n\n\nshopping experience  just buying stuff\n10 km

better if no 30min delivery for groceries\nlet me say that as an nri who frequents lulu abroad i dont enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it\n\nthe crowd and parking\n\nthe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability shopping at ramachandrans at mot is less stressful but they dont have extensive product range if youre looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit youre most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher\n\nspeaking of fruits and veggies most local vendors dont allow you to pick your own selection they mix good and stale ones and hand it over places like lulu ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so\n\nanother advantage of lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops i dont think the young gen are accustomed or most likely wont be future clients of such local butchery shops\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants\n\nduring covid after trying many home delivery services i relied mostly on am needs and farmers fresh zone the latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users the problem with farmers fresh zone was the products were okayishnot fresh and their estimated time for delivery uncertainno live tracking similar to zomatoswiggy and it seems theyve acquired am needs now\n\nhorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet\n\ncoming back to lulu shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods\nfrom my experience working in fnv sector\nthese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need dailyeven if the supply is low they need itthe company wont directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and storedthe most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storageto ensure continuous supply\nso the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired productsthe company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc and also there would be anti dumping policies they cant handle waste so let others handle em so the vendor after procuringgradingtransporting they would always be at risk of rejectionbecause of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium thats why its expensive\nthe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster

the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart

service offered by bigbasketblinkitinstamart etc how was the service are the fruits and vegetables are selected properly before delivery i want to try bigbasket anything to keep in mind before ordering do they accept upi at the time of delivery one problem with bigbasket is if you have multiple addresses in your account please make sure that you choose the right address manually at the beginning of your session on the app also please make sure that the right address has been carried forward to the order summary page just before payment bigbasket isnt as intuitive as the other apps and so one assumes that the right address based on ones location is correctly selected but that isnt the case happy shopping \nabout the other two theyve got exorbitantly priced broccoli lettuce and other exotic veggies that are reasonably priced in other cities theyve got to work on improving their selection of veggies\nnone available in my area","37":"need adviceswiggy tips i use swiggy a lot both food and particularly swiggy instamart\niam living alone for the time being  studying for it i used to give tips 20 or 30 and water in the beginning a lot but since i used it a lot it was adding up i decided to stop tipping got a maid for house swiggy food i was using less\n\ntodays i ordered 9 tender coconut cause its hot and got it delivered i picked it up from porch and took into kichen gave the bag back the guy ridiculed and told me why no tips for chai or something since it was the heaviest pack he had also be aware it takes less than 8 min for the guy get here from swiggy warehouse\n\ni told him i use the service and have taken subscriptions for free delivery and is already paying a premium\ni use the platform too much to tip all the time since he pushed for tips and kinda insisted iam not sure\n\ni was considering weather to tip him from phone once i go back in now not sure\n\nfyikeep in mind as an nri i get asked for money daily from neighbors to friends to relatives to shop owners to who ever the f i run by so iam practicing saying no also if i dont give a guilt trip is usually there\n\nwhats ur thoughts \n\n not what you asked but were the coconuts any good ive bought tender coconuts twice from swiggy and both times there was barely a spoonful of meat in there\nyoure a student im guessing from your post you only have limited money dont feel guilty about not leaving a tip you did nothing wrong\n\nthe delivery exec was probably just tired and cranky because theyre slogging in the hot sun so the frustration from his end is understandable too \n\nbut again you did nothing wrong save your money tip when you start earning enough to afford to tip\ni worked as a swiggy delivery personnel earlier and once delivered one maxed out instamart delivery i think it was 30kg  i never asked for any tips regardless of the weight of the order you shouldnt feel bad for this it was not his place to ask especially since it is a tip\nout of context

concerns","38":"instamart fleet management driven by swiggys greed swiggy fleet is managed in two ways one way for instamart and the other way for food and genie it is the same person who can be assigned any of the orders when a food or genie order is placed by the customer then the delivery partner is assigned who reaches the pickup location but in case of instamart swiggy wants the deliveries within 10 minutes so guess what happens the delivery partner is summoned even before you place the order you might just be visiting the instamart section with no intention of ordering or just decided not to order from instamart for some reason the delivery partner is already directed towards the instamart warehouse  \nthis has happened multiple times with me and happened again today i was waiting at instamart for 20 min then they unassigned my order if it was food or genie i would have gotten some money for waiting but as it was instamart a subsidiary of swiggy they save every penny and not pay any wait time they use this money to show the investors that instamart was a good investment to make\n\neven during peak hours and late nights instamart deliveries dont pay anything extra do yall pay extra for instamart deliveries during surge and late nights wow this funding valuation inflation is so shitty doesnt really benifit anyone just increases networth of the

of my monthly expenditure that i think i can put on the cards would be helpful\n\n1 rent 25k\n2 groceries 5k i have a tiffin service hence this is low\ud83d\ude2c\n3 dining 8k\n4 swiggyzomato 5k\n5 phone  subscriptions 2k although some are billed annually\n6 movies 2k ticketsconfectionary\n7 petrol 4k\n8 amazon 2k\n9 offline spends 5k\n\napart from these expenses maybe the odd yearly large purchase\n\ni only have a dcb metal currently addon from my brother and i have been buying vouchers for swiggy and amazon so dining dineout groceries instamart and amazon fresh and delivery get taken care of this way having this card also takes lounge access off my list of priorities needed in the card\n\nfurthermore i am eligible for sapphiro through the alumni program though i am yet to apply for it for anyone whos applied and gotten it any tips would be appreciated ques do i have to be eligible salarywise as well what supporting documents do they require\n\ni make 1 or 2 trips a year to my hometown so i was eyeing an airline card too maybe the vistara ones premium economybusiness class tickets do sound very tempting\n\ni also dont like the idea of paying joining or annual fees i would like to avoid that as much as possible i know getting a fyf subsequently a waiver after spends or a ltf card may prove to be difficult but i am looking for suggestions that may eventually offer the possibility at the very least\n\napart from this i think hdfc swiggy may be a good option sorry if this feels all over the place at the end of the day i just want to maximise the value i can get from my expenses in any way cashback points etc any and all inputs will be greatly appreciated\nalso i already bank with icici and hdfc if thats of any consideration \n\nthank you for your time get

a refund and it still hasnt processed yet i have talked with the support 3 times from that day any thing i can do  removed\nremoved","43":"swiggy instamart delivered items with harpic bleach all over them  warning against using swiggy instamart and rant posting on behalf of a friend in her words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom

apartment i got really curious as to how the other person must have ordered \nwent back home checked on my brothers mobile and it was available i logged out from my mobile and used my brothers id which did not have a swiggy one membership and voila instamart was miraculously delivering to my home \nto make things sure i logged in with my id on brothers mobile and no instamart services \nso now i am pretty sure swiggy is selectively disabling instamart services to swiggy one subscribers what a bunch of cheating pricks i wish i had the time and liberty to sue these guys in court  ","45":"need opinions on deliveries as a source of side income skip this part if you want its just the reason hey there guys im about to get into college in the following month since i wasnt able to score enough to get a government college ill have to go for a private college but i dont want my dad to pay for it since he is already on the verge or retiring and has a few heart complications he wont be able to provide for home and my fees soon so im on a hunt to find a method to earn enough to pay off my college fees atleast\n\ni dont have any skills other than being good at logical reasoning mathematics and rubiks cube i love teaching too but its hard to find people of these interests thats why i decided to go for deliveries\n\nmy fees may vary between 80k to 18l  2l donation in first year so im planning to able to earn atleast 400 per day 12000pm 500 per day 15000pm is cool and 800 24000pm is just wonderful i cant ask for more ill be able to give my dad the money in installments for my college fees and some for home and ofcourse some for myself as well so is it possible to earn this much from deliveries\n\nif yes which delivery apps may it be food delivery like swiggy zomato or instant delivery like zepto instamart etc are the best if i can give 23 hours of my time daily and dont require a bike since i only have a bicycle i live in western mumbai if that matters i dont know about delivery platforms but you can try sites such as telus wich provide translationtranscriptionannotation jobs they are not hard require less amount of time and you can easily earn 70 to 100 per month\nyou can also join some institute which prepares students for bank exams there your logical reasoning and math skills could be utilized you can be a part timer and take like 23 classes a day\nmight make more sense to offer your teaching skills on fiverr or upwork actually theres a lot of potential there","47":"looking for what i should add remove and continue to keep from my very

confronted myself the dp support is very frustrating the cos take them for granted despite clearly knowing that dps are the ones which are actually the breadwinner for the company itself i admit other business units like sales and administration contribute however the indifference to support delivery partners is beyond acceptable tolerable limits  \na few issues are hereunder\n\n1 no monthly account statement for earnings and other notes other than weekly payout notes swiggy does not seem to be interested in giving out these lack of transparency because at times payout denied and also delayed with unnecessary and irrational debits which there is no efficient grievance redressal team at swiggy\n2 swiggy keeps giving robocalls for notifications through their vendors exotel despite no explicit optin reporting to trai dnd and escalating is of no avail as exotel keeps calling from different numbers\n3 despite during onboarding they advertise of no onboarding fee down the line after a few weeks they debit a steep charge for the same without a rational justification this is over and above the security deposit as well\n4 the instamart at select locations i confirmed the same at tambaram chennai delays the inscan of the reusable bags and then if a warning is issued regarding nonreturn they cooly respond a technical error and is covering up\n5 refusal to change shifts and hence delaydenial of incentives the shift form is cryptic and support is not assisting in changing the same\n6 though the incentives do not say about active shift they use it as a hidden condition to avoid giving to delivery partners\n7 more than 100 orders delivery partner need to be enrolled in partner club however a number of delivery partners remain in open rolls without being tagged into one

order it happened again but this time we had proof complained but nothing happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i

320including platform and delivery fee and its approx rs 350\n\n\n\n the market rate for chicken in delhi is rs 240kg processed and not whole\n\n the local shop owner takes rs 10 as delivery charge\n\n swiggy instamart tells me to buy another rs 180 worth of stuff to offer me a free delivery\n\n on top of it on every order it charges me a platform fee\n\n\n\nbecause of my dog i order chicken almost every week and just by making this one shift i have saved up over rs 400 in a month\n\n\n\ni have deleted zomato from my phone and we have consciously reduced ordering food online by taking a cook who has a fixed salary every month no surge fee no exorbitant taxes at the checkout page\n\nwe have saved an estimated rs 1500month only on taxes and platform fees that zomato charged for food\n\n\n\nwe use amazon fresh for grocery shopping and put what we need on a list every day and order at the end of every week at once\n\nby doing this we avoid ordering from any quickcommerce apps if you have a dmart around you please go and get it from there nothing can beat those prices\n\n\n\nthese are just a few changes we have made consciously to avoid giving money to platforms that promise convenience often making a hole in our pockets without us realizing it \n\n\n\nthe early offers impulse buying and creation of urgency for a product are all manufactured\n\nthe earlier you realize it the more sustainable your monthly budget looks\n\ncheers\n\n\n\n\n\n this is the way to go op\nyep i did exactly the same this month same situation my dog and food ordering etc etc it works significant savings\nawesome i have started saving a lot by getting a cook for myself also healthy and hygienic food but what you are doing needs some serious commitment\nthese online deliveries are a major expense and we dont even realize it as 300500 for each order accumulates to a large amount monthly \n\nwhen im in bangalore swiggydining easily crosses 1012k monthly now im in my hometown for more than a month and it did not even cross 1k \n\nfor fruits vegetables and meat local stores are atleast 2530 cheaper and have better quality\ni look up for menu on zomato and add it to cart  then search the hotel on google and call them and place orderplus am not the kind who wants starbucks coffee at home  so this method cover my needs when i need to order and not want to pay taxes on zomato","55":"does starting blinkit in tier 3 makes sense  i dont know if this is considered a startup or not but i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with inapp payments\n\t\tproduct quality\n\nits a simple idea but i think it could really work if executed well","56":"swiggy instamart is really helpful sorry for off topic but i wanted to share this i usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy this incident made me reconsider my thoughts\n\ni typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab since its raining in bengaluru i need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else i would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella\n\n the concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up\n\nits the after sales support im worried about no checking or returns at doorstep selling old expired or near expiry items returned and repackaged or seal broken and used items irresponsible customer care agents\n\nthats sorta things\neverything is worth it if you have money and people like those on this sub often can trade money for convenience\nwell of course billions of dollars are being poured by vcs into this industry theyre not fools to be so bullish on this for no reason \n\nside note how are you able to walk the distance thats equivalent to almost 300 cab fare\nyeah we had a 40hour power outage here because of the cyclone so i ordered a power bank from instamart with extra discount and 10 cashback  fully charged saved my phones battery from dying\nmy dad works on a laptop which doesnt have a functioning keyboard so he uses external keyboard one day that stopped working as well my dad wasnt well and i work in another city i could have purchased from amazon but even with prime they hardly ever deliver within a day other option was to go to market  \ni dont use instant delivery services much but somehow decided to look up on blinkit and found several options keyboard got delivered within 8 minutes","57":"swiggy instamart in

food delivery players alongside zomato with a strong user base and brand loyalty plus its been diversifying with offerings like instamart quick commerce and swiggy genie personalized delivery services tapping into new markets like rapid grocery delivery\n\nhowever swiggys drhp shows persistent losses since inception and negative cash flow though it has made recent progress in narrowing those losses the company still relies heavily on discounts and marketing to retain users which puts pressure on profit margins theres also increased regulatory scrutiny on gig workers and potential tax liabilities which could add to its costs and operational complexities in the future furthermore swiggy faces strong competition from zomato and new entrants like the governmentbacked ondc which offers food delivery at significantly lower prices this puts swiggy under pressure to innovate and retain its user base while managing costs effectively\n\nthat said there are still reasons some investors might find swiggy attractive indias online food delivery and quickcommerce markets are still relatively young and swiggy has a solid track record of growth and brand recognition its quickcommerce arm instamart is growing fast and could potentially become a profitable segment swiggys ability to diversify beyond food delivery could make it a more resilient and versatile company in the long run\n\nso the big question is whether swiggy can achieve sustainable profitability and capitalize on its brand and market position or if ongoing competition and operational challenges will weigh down its performance what do you think are the growth prospects worth the risk\n\n\n\n \nif you havent already please add your own analysisopinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a low

please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorindianstockmarket if you have any questions or concerns\nyou have summed up pros and cons very well  the only thing i would add is nearly half\u00a0 of swiggys revenue42  actually comes from providing supply chain services to wholesalers retailers and fmcg brands\u00a0\n\n\ni like swiggy as a customer and regularly use it around 10 times a month i am hopeful that company will turn profitable sooner or later with increasing disposable income and demand for quick commerce\u00a0\n\n\nwill be holding this for longterm if i get the ipo\n\n\n\u00a0\ni wrote a long detailed analysis here  \n\ndiscounts and marketing spend are coming down for both companies as they are now a duopoly which should improve margins for both\n\ni havent looked into regulatory risk but i think the states will not take anything so drastic as to cripple their business most likely a gig workers fund which will affect margins a bit\n\ni would not worry about new competitors this industry has played out and now at the scale zomato and swiggy are there is no way a new competitor will emerge zepto will probably be acquired by swiggy or zomato\n\nto me the most worrying thing for swiggy is zomatos growing so much faster and has so much better margins but its listing at 60 of zomatos market cap and might even drop prices further so could be an interesting play","60":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25 week of dec 16th 2024 hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks

for posting  i wanted to let  you know that i really appreciate you taking your time to post here\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved","65":"starting to see the end of affordable grocery delivery apps came on here after hearing and seeing zeptos plan to become profitable im starting to see rs 3 platform fee and extra delivery costs for non gold members this could be across india but im seeing it already here in bengaluru where lots of people order groceries even with the membership one really only avails the benefits after a purchase of rs 599 which isnt something ill be spending as a young person living alone on just a single grocery purchase seems to me that if this starts making them enough money other apps will follow zepto is currently the only one without big backing  blinkit has zomato bigbasket has tata instamart has swiggy and milkbasket has reliance and theyre facing difficulty in getting funding but seems to me like id rather go to a grocery store now where i can get better discounts which ive been doing since theyve started rolling this out \n\nis it just me or are they targeting a more affluent demographic with these changes is the market too saturated with choices \n\nwhat do you all think how popular is grocery delivery among families and bachelors here \n\nedit i was born and brought up in bengaluru and only started using grocery delivery apps during the lockdown for urgent needs ive always gone to the local store next to my apartment or other stores nearby however when im coming back home late at night after work around 910 ive been able to do any urgent grocery shopping conveniently and at pretty affordable rates during the weekdays using quick delivery apps like zepto im saying its a convenient option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy

is paying the rent of the electric bike and was asking for 400 straight up i didnt even realise how he was asking this amount i didnt understand anything then said he needs penalty amount \n400 is nothing much couldve helped him yes but honestly my gut was taken aback that randomly he is upfront asking me cash he pestered my friend first then when we finally told him didnt have cash and wanted to move ahead he again loudly asks me madam aapke pass hai kya \nnot sure of the new scam or anything but as a woman in mumbai id be even more wary of ordering anything online or just generally delivery partners around on the road or anything safety perspective\nis this like a new scam \nps not looking down on anyone have been thinking about this suspicious behaviour since yesterday ki kya

particular guy was bluffing or saying the truth but you should always do what your gut tells you\nanybody asking for money in the first conversation itself is a red flag do not listen to what they say they might convince you i tend to make up excuse of getting late to somewhere and skip the small talk\nsimilar think happened to me coincidently over the placed mentioned only a balloon seller asked me for 1 plate momoshe was like bhook lagi hai sir i bought him 1 plate momos but thought to myself that couldve have eaten 1 plate of lunch or dinner in that amount he was around my age only so i

persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n  quick commerceinstant delivery is built on the principles of ultra cheap and readily available labour  this is the reason youd never see this work in us or eu with better equitable distribution of income \n\nthanks op for the honest account kudos to your writing skills\nthanks for this i urge everyone to at least  climb down the stairs or take a lift and collect the orders as we have to collect only one order but the delivery executive has to climb to at least 1520 homes in a day\n\nalso thanks for sharing this i saw a swiggy instamart guy riding his bike absolutely drenched in rain at 10 am this morning and i felt awful \n\nplease ride safe in the rain and stay safe cheers\naaaah\n\nsame old story with delivery gigs jobs everywhere \n\ni really hope you come out of this gutter someday \n\nthe only way this blinkit zepto instamart business survives is by exploiting folks like you \n\ndo not expect this from people ordering most are just grade a trashbags \n\nstay focused on what you will be doing next\nits a privilege really to be able to order at midnight or during rains\nyou are simply asking people to be considerate and thats valid\nif we are ever confused about how to act its simple be kind\nthanks for sharing

to acquire customers and market share but once they start focusing on profits will people actually continue using them\n\ntake zomato and swiggy for examplethey charge more than the restaurant prices if these quick delivery apps also start pricing higher than local stores do you think people will still buy from them the convenience is great for emergenciesbut people are willing to pay extra for that every time\n\nmost of us compare prices and love a good deal if the discounts go away or things get too expensive wouldnt a lot of users  just go back to  local kirana shops or supermarkets or do you think these apps are creating a habit that people wont mind paying for\n\ncurious to know what you guys thinkare these apps here to stay or is it just a phase until they stop being cheap would you still use them if they charged more its all about the valuation currently \nonce the bottomline factor will kick in things will normalise and the strategies might change a bit \n\nquick commerce will stay for sure the scale will vary\nits plausible if they leverage their buying power to get inventory at heavily discounted rates and put prices reasonably low enough to still make profit basically the dmart strategy but online\nyoud have said the same thing for swiggy zomato few years back the idea is to get people so hooked to it theres no other way im totally hooked and now dont schedule grocery shopping in my days or weeks which means id get used to not spending that extra time so im sure even later id be willing to pay the price rather than spend 1 2 hours in commuting and shopping groceries plus standing in long queues \nalso i dont think zepto or blinkit and all are cheaper theyre infact more expensive when it comes to veggies and fruits\nblinkit does deliveries only within 2 km from their stores and charge 21 rs extra for it its definitely not free delivery\nhere to stay but we will see big mncs pressure them into taking less margins as they get low margins on other

but only received 140 in cashbacknot yet credited in accountas per the 10 cashback policy i should have received at least 200\n\nseptember statement i earned 420 in cashbacknot yet credited in

different mcc merchant category code because of this im not getting the right cashback which is unfair it seems like a swiggy issue but im the one being penalized\n\nmoreover since i got the card i havent received a single rupee cashback in my statement ive emailed axis twice about this and heres what they replied\n\n we would like to reiterate you that cashback at the transaction level couldnt be shared since there is categorywise capping we dont have the function to send the breakup of cashback cashbacks are systemgenerated and hence a breakup is not available please highlight the transaction on which you feel cashback is credited less\nwe wish to inform you that cashback is only eligible for transactions done on the swiggy app for food delivery and dineout if you make a transaction on instamart genie etc you will not be eligible for cashback\n\nit feels like im being tossed around here and i dont know if this is just a technical glitch on their part or something else im wondering if i can escalate this issue to the rbi ombudsman at least regarding the cashback credit issue has anyone gone this route before or can someone guide me on how to proceed not everythings

well 30 yoy growth at loss of 6255 crore\n\nbut when you look at qoq it is a different story\n\nloss widened from 611 crore to 625 crore revenue rose 1177 from 3322 to 3601 crore but fineprint is it came on back of very heavy competitive quick commerce business instamart food delivery business grown qoq at 4 which is very concerning it means food delivery revenue is flattened this quarter\n\nconsidering 80 weightage to food business in valuation  ebit of 122 crore then also it is 250300 pe higher than zomato zomato profit is five times they said will take 2 more years to be profitable why\n\nthats why i keep on saying extremely high pe means very high risk again it is not recommendations it is how you analyze the fine print number wrapped into big big business reports people will try to use different stories and rationale to justify why their massive growth stock is worth 1 lakh crore or 25 lac crores but investing in such companies at these valuation is juat plain stupid imo especially when its a loss making business or a company that makes a good chunk of its net profits through other income or exceptional items and interest payment\ntheir most profitable

oxygen for any business entity they have a negative cash flow back to back fy on the profit part i guess due to intense competition between the red team and orange team increasing their platform fee

delivery companies has more marginal cost than what we are pay because vcs had provided the burn money to get more customers it remained hidden quick refunds more delivery fleet for fast and midnight etc was part of this whole setup\n\nmany vcs now know that the market size for these services in india is small so vc funding is drying up to remain alive these companies now need to become profitable for that they need to try and extract that marginal cost this can be through\n\n1 smaller fleets to reduce cost this causes delivery times to go up\n2 bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size this again causes delivery times to go up\n3 asking extra money if bunching isnt opted by customers\n4 saving costs spent on replacing food or issuing discount coupons this causes customer support quality to go down extra checks on claims asking for pics emails etc\n5 increasing cart value requirements to generate more revenue\n6 hiking prices on subscriptions because buying subscription is an indicator that you can afford to pay more for the same service it is counter intuitive but true\n\nthe unfortunate thing is that we have become very dependent on these companies i use swiggy and bbinstant a lot it has been a fun ride but the future does look bleak\nthey are grouping order nowadays in last 34 months ive had delivery person going in opposite direction coming near my home and then turning off their location and not responding to calls trying to search through my order in their bag turning off location altogether as soon as they pickup order and then turning it back when they reach just near me\u00a0\nat least blinkit seems to have some serious logistics problem their warehouse is very close to my apartment less than 500 meters and folks are sitting idle on their bikes usually but when i try to order on app it says over 2 hours due to high transactions\nyeah they are getting worse \n\nwatch this videoenshittification\nthey is different between business and startup these quick commerce are dependence business its involves multiple things in business \nthey tell they will be profitable of some year after burning 1000s of crores with 12 crore and at that new players comes to be honest long run business are not built like these"}]],"17":[[{"negative":0.6549141407,"neutral":0.1658306271,"positive":0.1792552471,"aspect":"instamart","text":"what is this

it showed ill get free lays and pepsi with it it sounded great would get to get full without stressing the pocket much the delivery parner came but only had the cup noddles i asked about the pepsi and lays he had no idea about it he said to ask the customer service now ive heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so dont know how to ask im really confused what do do how to inform swiggy \ndont take it in the wrong way i didnt ask them to offer anything free but if you do promse pls do send it really hurts\ud83d\ude2d tagging uswiggyofficial\nhopefully thatll

ordered chips coke and fews icecreams got the notification that it is delivered but i did not receive it i called the delivery guy he was rude and said that he delivered it to someone and now its not his responsibility he did not even check whether it was me like atleast ask for the name or crosscheck or something \nhad to call the helpdesk 3 times for them to initiate another delivery and even then there were no icecreams so called them again and just told them to refund the amount of the icecreams all of this took more than 3 hours now i use zepto and always opt for pay on

for is a rating but over the years and across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many never order cod if the person ordering is not present to take the order delivery guys deliberately ask for more if elderly people receive the order and they may also shout and threaten elderly if they dont pay up immediately have read so many cases about this\nfake images in listings is not a swiggy scam you dont get shah rukh khan with lux and juhi chawla with taaza people know this for ages\n\npump and dump is a term used for an actual fraud what you are describing is a legit way how business

i decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet ive used various cards in the past including hsbc hdfc and amex but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process just one question with an 80l  annual income  why are you applying for cards like swiggy hdfc instead of just upgrading your regalia gold to infinia \nim more interested to know what you do for a living\ncrif  exeperian are secondary primarily only cibil is checked by the banks\nit seems like you ownrun a business banks prefer salaried employees in comparison with business people even if business people file for higher itr \n\n  \nanyways what the your 3 major spend category or maybe tell us platform \n\n  \nbut in general i will recommend you hsbc live 10 on zomato dining in and dmart 15 all other but ignore if you only use swiggy since you already have hdfc swiggy amazon icic or axis fk depending on the platform you shop from kotak myntra if you shop from myntra axis airtel if you have airtel broadband or sim \n\n  \nso with the card you already have and if you add any of the above mentioned cards you have covered lounge access amazon or fk shoppping food deliverydine in utility payments myntra shopping 5 on most online spents using swiggy card upi card groceries shopping at dmart and miscellaneous offline payments\n1 an 80l earner preferring minor cashback over major rewards seems counterintuitive  \n2 to experience a better version of sbi apply for their aurum comes with great lifestyle benefits  \n3 your icici card is a cobranded one these often dont get the respective discounts that the core cards get"}]],"22":[[{"negative":0.7425211072,"neutral":0.0653186738,"positive":0.1921601444,"aspect":"instamart","text":"the universe always seems to find a way

still visit it once a week either on weekends or weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business people dont visit lulu just for groceries its a weekend outing for them when they go to lulu\n\n\nshopping experience  just buying stuff\n10 km away aanel  \u0d28\u0d19\u0d19\u0d7e\u0d15\u0d15

rates why do you even need grocery delivery in under 30 mins services would be much better if no 30min delivery for groceries\nlet me say that as an nri who frequents lulu abroad i dont enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it\n\nthe crowd and parking\n\nthe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability shopping at ramachandrans at mot is less stressful but they dont have extensive product range if youre looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit youre most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher\n\nspeaking of fruits and veggies most local vendors dont allow you to pick your own selection they mix good and stale ones and hand it over places like lulu ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so\n\nanother advantage of lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops i dont think the young gen are accustomed or most likely wont be future clients of such local butchery shops\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants\n\nduring covid after trying many home delivery services i relied mostly on am needs and farmers fresh zone the latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users the problem with farmers fresh zone was the products were okayishnot fresh and their estimated time for delivery uncertainno live tracking similar to zomatoswiggy and it seems theyve acquired am needs now\n\nhorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet\n\ncoming back to lulu shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods\nfrom my experience working in fnv sector\nthese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need dailyeven if the supply is low they need itthe company wont directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and storedthe most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storageto ensure continuous supply\nso the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired productsthe company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc and also there would be anti dumping policies they cant handle waste so let others handle em so the vendor after procuringgradingtransporting they would always be at risk of rejectionbecause of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium thats why its expensive\nthe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster before it goes stale farmers are being utilised by the corporate without them knowing it\n\nfruits and vegetables are not machine made they form naturally there would be defects and problem but you could always choose whats goodsupport local business as they are the real backbone of farmers"}]],"25":[[{"negative":0.0268010553,"neutral":0.8378762007,"positive":0.1353226751,"aspect":"instamart","text":"how many of you are using big basket so recently i bought vegetables from big

thing is after a purchase for the second purchase we may have to pay extra amount 1520 rs usually for me due to them bringing not exactly the weight of vegetables we buy eg if we buy 2 kg onion and

location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n namaste\nthanks for submitting to

offered by bigbasketblinkitinstamart etc how was the service are the fruits and vegetables are selected properly before delivery i want to try bigbasket anything to keep in mind before ordering do they accept upi at the time of delivery one problem with bigbasket is if you have multiple addresses in your account please make sure that you choose the right address manually at the beginning of your session on the app also please make sure that the right address has been carried forward to the order summary page just before payment bigbasket isnt as intuitive as the other apps and so one assumes that the right address based on ones location is correctly selected but that isnt the case happy shopping \nabout the other two theyve got exorbitantly priced broccoli lettuce and other exotic veggies that are reasonably priced in other cities theyve got to work on improving their selection of veggies\nnone available in my

instamart\niam living alone for the time being  studying for it i used to give tips 20 or 30 and water in the beginning a lot but since i used it a lot it was adding up i decided to stop tipping got a maid for house swiggy food i was using less\n\ntodays i ordered 9 tender coconut cause its hot and got it delivered i picked it up from porch and took into kichen gave the bag back the guy ridiculed and told me why no tips for chai or something since it was the heaviest pack he had also be aware it takes less than 8 min for the guy get here from swiggy warehouse\n\ni told him i use the service and have taken subscriptions for free delivery and is already paying a premium\ni use the platform too much to tip all the time since he pushed for tips and kinda insisted iam not sure\n\ni was considering weather to tip him from phone once i go back in now not sure\n\nfyikeep in mind as an nri i get asked for money daily from neighbors to friends to relatives to shop owners to who ever the f i run by so iam practicing saying no also if i dont give a guilt trip is usually there\n\nwhats ur thoughts \n\n not what you asked but were the coconuts any good ive bought tender coconuts twice from swiggy and both times there was barely a spoonful of meat in there\nyoure a student im guessing from your post you only have limited money dont feel guilty about not leaving a tip you did nothing wrong\n\nthe delivery exec was probably just tired and cranky because theyre slogging in the hot sun so the frustration from his end is understandable too \n\nbut again you did nothing wrong save your money tip when you start earning enough to afford to tip\ni worked as a swiggy delivery personnel earlier and once delivered one maxed out instamart delivery i think it was 30kg  i never asked for any tips regardless of the weight of the order you shouldnt feel bad for this it was not his place to ask especially since it is a tip\nout of context what are you studying in it n where\nhi thanks for

two ways one way for instamart and the other way for food and genie it is the same person who can be assigned any of the orders when a food or genie order is placed by the customer then the delivery partner is assigned who reaches the pickup location but in case of instamart swiggy wants the deliveries within 10 minutes so guess what happens the delivery partner is summoned even before you place the order you might just be visiting the instamart section with no intention of ordering or just decided not to order from instamart for some reason the delivery partner is already directed towards the instamart warehouse  \nthis has happened multiple times with me and happened again today i was waiting at instamart for 20 min then they unassigned my order if it was food or genie i would have gotten some money for waiting but as it was instamart a subsidiary of swiggy they save every penny and not pay any wait time they use this money to show the investors that instamart was a good

today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom

startup or not but i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments

usually think that quick delivery apps like blinkit zepto and instamart are kinda less useful to people and actually making people lazy this incident made me reconsider my thoughts\n\ni typically go to office by walk and sometimes by cab since its raining in bengaluru i need an umbrella for tomorrows office travel but all shops were closed as i searched nearby suddenly i got an idea to order them in zepto or instamart \n\nand surprisingly the umbrella was available in instamart and too with additional coupon of 100 rs since i have the swiggy hdfc cc i used that too and got additional 28rs cashback \n\nthen i realised the actual usefulness of those applications or else i would have booked a cab tomorrow which will cost me around same price as umbrella\n\n the concept is good but in corporate hands they butcher it up\n\nits the after sales support im worried about no checking or returns at doorstep selling old expired or near expiry items returned and repackaged or seal broken and used items irresponsible customer care agents\n\nthats sorta things\neverything is worth it if you have money and people like those on this sub often can trade money for convenience\nwell of course billions of dollars are being poured by vcs into this industry theyre not fools to be so bullish on this for no reason \n\nside note how are you able to walk the distance thats equivalent to almost 300 cab fare\nyeah we had a 40hour power outage here because of the cyclone so i ordered a power bank from instamart with extra discount and 10 cashback  fully charged saved my phones battery from dying\nmy dad works on a laptop which doesnt have a functioning keyboard so he uses external keyboard one day that stopped working as well my dad wasnt well and i work in another city i could have purchased from amazon but even with prime they hardly ever deliver within a day other option was to go to market  \ni dont use instant delivery services much but somehow decided to look up on blinkit and found several options keyboard got delivered within 8 minutes"}]],"57":[[{"negative":0.0314168036,"neutral":0.5116549134,"positive":0.456928283,"aspect":"instamart","text":"swiggy

there are some interesting factors for investors to consider on one hand swiggy has established itself as one of indias top two food delivery players alongside zomato with a strong user base and brand loyalty plus its been diversifying with offerings like instamart quick commerce and swiggy genie personalized delivery services tapping into new markets like rapid grocery delivery\n\nhowever swiggys drhp shows persistent losses since inception and negative cash flow though it has made recent progress in narrowing those losses the company still relies heavily on discounts and marketing to retain users which puts pressure on profit margins theres also increased regulatory scrutiny on gig workers and potential tax liabilities which could add to its costs and operational complexities in the future furthermore swiggy faces strong competition from zomato and new entrants like the governmentbacked ondc which offers food delivery at significantly lower prices this puts swiggy under pressure to innovate and retain its user base while managing costs effectively\n\nthat said there are still reasons some investors might find swiggy attractive indias online food delivery and quickcommerce markets are still relatively young and swiggy has a solid track record of growth and brand recognition its quickcommerce arm instamart is growing fast and could potentially become a profitable segment swiggys ability to diversify beyond food delivery could make it a more resilient and versatile company in the long run\n\nso the big question is whether swiggy can achieve sustainable profitability and capitalize on its brand and market position or if ongoing competition and operational challenges will weigh down its performance what do you think are the growth prospects worth the risk\n\n\n\n

subredditmessagecomposetorindianstockmarket if you have any questions or concerns\nyou have summed up pros and cons very well  the only thing i would add is nearly half\u00a0 of swiggys revenue42  actually comes from providing supply chain services to wholesalers retailers and fmcg brands\u00a0\n\n\ni like swiggy as a customer and regularly use it around 10 times a month i am hopeful that company will turn profitable sooner or later with increasing disposable income and demand for quick commerce\u00a0\n\n\nwill be holding this for longterm if i get the ipo\n\n\n\u00a0\ni wrote a long detailed analysis here  \n\ndiscounts and marketing spend are coming down for both companies as they are now a duopoly which should improve margins for both\n\ni havent looked into regulatory risk but i think the states will not take anything so drastic as to cripple their business most likely a gig workers fund which will affect margins a bit\n\ni would not worry about new competitors this industry has played out and now at the scale zomato and swiggy are there is no way a new competitor will emerge zepto will probably be acquired by swiggy or zomato\n\nto me the most worrying thing for swiggy is zomatos growing so much faster and has so much better margins but its listing at 60 of zomatos market cap and might even drop prices further so could be an interesting play"}]],"60":[[{"negative":0.1970617622,"neutral":0.3848687708,"positive":0.4180695117,"aspect":"instamart","text":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25 week of dec 16th 2024

option when other local stores are closed or not accessible thats what i meant  shop in local stores not the ones who have like mini marts but neighborhood small shops you need them or else everything will rocket in prices soon once they leave your area\nlocal stores supremacy\ni have tried these grocery apps there is comfort in it i dont deny but their markup is high and they always push a brand or two so no doesnt work for me\nplease go to a grocery store nearby and support the local store most shops are happy to home deliver also if you are a regular  they even price some items below mrp and pass on the savings also you get the retail options not some name brand promoted by the platform priced at what they want and to top it off you can also do a quality comparison across choices by actually looking at the product\nso far swiggy zepto was making losses and they were burning vc pe money\n\nbut that era is coming to an end\n\nit is never possible to deliver at the costs they did
