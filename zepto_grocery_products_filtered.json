to left\n\n1 hotwheels car smells kinda metallic and rusty 0 performance its my favourite as it looks very cool\n\n2 pendora scents noir en leather clone of tom fords ombre leather got it yesterday for 1k from a friend who didnt like it and used it only twice it might be a bit too early to call this my favourite i know but it smells so damn good to me \nopening kind of spicy with the main note of cardamomelaichi this doesnt last very long though\ndry down rich and syntheticbut in the best way possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance very pleasant not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather\n\n5 jaguar classic black\nmy daily go to got it for 24k on blinkitzeptoi dont remembervery generic and mass pleasing cant really put my hand on what notes it uses but its fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge great summer frag but can be used all year round moderate performance the bottle is so dishevelled because i keep it in my bag for school everyday\n\n6 ajmal silver shade \ni use it sometimes when i get bored of jaguar got it for 12k on zepto fresh citrusy and metallic cant go wrong with this also ive heard its a clone of creeds silver mountain water but idk how far thats true performance is decent same as jaguar classic black \n\n7 decant of beardo whiskey smoke\nfriend gave this to me for free spicy winter frag pretty mid tho dont use it much nothing else to say here\n\n8 villain edp\nthis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 i used to love this and i finished a whole bottle of it within a year sweet dark and fresh smelling but this new bottle just isnt as strong and performace sucks barely lasts 30 minutes idk if they changed its formulation or what its just not the same anymore the only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia \n\n9 adidas ice dive\ngot gifted this by my cousins smell is pretty decent fresh citrusy and sporty wouldve been ranked way higher if it performed barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection\n\n10 ustra scuba cologne\nthis is the only fragrance in my collection i actually despise supposed to be fresh and aquatic but its just synthetic harsh and a complete mess literally nothing to like abt it dont waste ur money on this","2":"theyre trying to solve a problem that never really existed\nswish zepto cafe swiggy bolt etc promising fresh food in 10 mins when we know its

gimmicky investor money burning cash and running fake pr on linkedin and otherwise\nrecently came across some tweet alleging zepto  cafe using all kinds of dirty tricks and undercuts to fulfill their orders\n\nmy question is why\nif you really have only 10 mins to get food step down and get somethingwhich most people do btw i feel all these startups are so gimmicky 10 min delivery was already something which required so much exploitation but ill not get into that fresh food in 10 min seems like a joke which no one wants to hear btw every person who i have talked to has only scoffed at the idea calling it unnecessary\n\nmy question is we live in a world full of real issues why are we supporting shitty ideas like swish and zepto cafe just because they cater to like 01 of the people why not put it in places where it actually contributes to society\n\nwe all know that these people running promotions initially will show numbers and revenue but theres no way they can sustain plus the exploitation of labour is unmatched there is no justification to that and most importantly no need for it\n\nmight be wrong would like to hear more opinions","3":"theyre trying to solve a problem that

15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with

have free delivery charges but what i received was anything but fresh several items were either rotten or close to it i tried contacting their customer support hoping for an easy refund i was ready for replacement as well but it seems like i have to beg just to get what i paid for\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences with zepto or other quick commerce platforms its frustrating that they promise quality and speed but if theres a problem theyre conveniently unavailable or dismissive why are these platforms allowed to operate this way it feels like theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service","17":"this experience is a culmination of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating","18":"recently the service deeprooted was discontinued and transferred to

their customer care team to report the issue i was met with the rudest response imaginable instead of offering a solution or even an apology the representative i spoke with dismissed my concerns entirely and made no effort to rectify the situation it felt like they just didnt care about their customers or the quality of their service\n\nive never experienced such bad customer service i wanted to share this to warn others who might be considering using zeptothis is not the kind of service you expect from a company that promises convenience and quality\n\nsurprisingly some of my friends also

recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come

according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will

collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake

to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become

jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on

having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company

i am thinking of trying out axis or hdfc native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via dc this month till i find a better option in terms of privacy payment instrument acceptance and reliability i will stick to paytm  sbi dc as my default combo rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria i will settle once i have optimized my dc rewards i have never used cred cheq and

and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be

bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews

know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying

thanks for that  \n\n   now im checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still

only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know i can send him money over through gpay but i dont know i am skeptical of everyone ever since i got scammed ","35":"instamart and faster deliveries pune ","36":"i am

iphones in india in 2024 lets say 6 million are buying the high end expensive pro phones and theyre doing this in india which means they live here and will continue to live here and not run away abroad \n\nlets give the rest of the 4  million to samsung and others \nsamsung sells a lot of phones but only a few million high end ones those are the only ones you need to focus on \n\nyour target

concept\n\ngiving you one more framework to understand how companies and business models evolve and how to identify them at early stage of their corporate life cycle and get multi bagger returns you can integrate this framework with the high quality framework to have a more refined filter according to your result expectations\n\njust like people businesses grow mature and eventually decline and their success depends on how well they act their age the corporate life cycle which has six stagesstartup product development high growth maturity decline and demise\n\nearlystage companies burn cash and rely on future potential while mature firms generate stable profits and dividends declining firms face tough decisions to returning cash to stakeholders for valuation startups are valued based on potential and narrative as in the case of\u00a0zomato and swiggy while mature firms like\u00a0tcs\u00a0rely on cash flows and profits declining companies are valued on their liquidation potential\n\nstartups like\u00a0zomato\u00a0in its early days are ideadriven and burn cash to grow often with no profits so you cannot use the framework you need to value a mature business for startups\n\nproduct phase companies have scaling challenges be it local scaling or global scaling business and industry that have the scale elements are multi bagger because only few companies and business model can scalevarun beverages coca cola dominos software companies anything that can scale and  generate profits and fcf and be successfully implemented in different geographies will give multi baggers thats why one should focus on asset light business models which requires less capital to scale\n\nthe\u00a0highgrowth phase\u00a0brings rapid revenue growth but still requires reinvestment so you will see that the companies generates free cash flow but reinvest all for future growth amazon did this for more than 20 years because they had so many reinvestment opportunitiesthis is the best phase to invest because you make most of the returns50100200 baggers when the company transforms from growth to mature stage\n\nmature firms\u00a0like\u00a0hdfc

comment section the name of the stock and in which phase of business cycle your stock is\n\nyoung firms attract traders and speculative bets requiring longterm patience to have mutilabggers while mature firms appeal to value investors\u00a0\n\nleadership is an essential element of each phase of growth and it needs to change with time to increase the longevity and returns for investors\n\nstartups need visionaries \u00a0depeinder goyal at zomato or brian chesky at airbn or if you look at the past narayan murthy at infosys because they have to make bold and long term decision and should have risk taking capabilities  growthphase companies require scalefocused leaders and mature businesses need defenders of stability sanjiv mehta\u00a0at hindustan

because they have crossed the 3 essential stages and are now in mature and ageing stage some companies use acquisition to reignite the growth phase but usually its not successfulmature companies make costly acquisition and burn shareholder value\n\none more insight is that tech companies scale faster but age quickly they have a shorter lifespan in comparison to a fmcg medical device maker pharma company banks etcphilip morris diageo hermes have survived centurie and in indies case asian paints itc pharma companies have survived several decades on the other hand tech companies like satyam computer or nokia have a smaller life span of 3040 years\n\nif you are value investor focus on things that are not going to change in this digital word and if you want growth look for disruptors that are going to change the future landscape of a particular industry\n\nsmart management and companies who look to create value for their share holders accept their life stage and act accordinglya

bit higher compared to amazon  rps is higher at product level\n\n  \nanother solution \n\n store exact sku item for each product in table rather than inventory count  \n this way we can take locks sku

takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to

doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for

i received were in absolutely awful condition just completely inedible \n\ncontaminated water the most disturbing part was the sealed bisleri water bottle i drank it immediately after opening and something got stuck in my mouth looking closer i found red ants inside the bottle how is this even possible in a sealed bottle\n\nim seriously concerned about the quality control or lack thereof at zepto warehouses are they even checking the products theyre sending out how can contaminated water get through\n\ni urge zepto to address these concerns immediately investigate your warehouses check your processes and ensure customers are receiving safe highquality products\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences please share your stories in the comments lets bring this issue to zeptos

in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here","138":"today i ordered groceries from zepto and the tomatoes were infested with worms like literally moving worms i did report this to their customer care but seemed like they were deflecting by transferring this chat to higher ups and all such non sense so asking people of bangalore beware when ordering from any such apps because there is no quality check \nfeeling disgusted","139":"\nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar ","140":"ordered one register and and 12 plus i used my zepto cash so it was only 10rs

conditions in bangalore and the language barrier there \n\ndont remember the expost but people were arguing about which place is better than other\n\nwell i shifted from bangalore to bhubaneswar on 1st july after staying there for 3 years\n\nhere are some observations\n\npros of living in bangalore\n1 fast paced life people work hard and you do the same\n2 you see successful people there and that helps you work harder too\n3 you get a better pay over there\n4 the weather is \u2764\n5 the language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\ncons of living in bangalore\n1 the city kind of lost its heart you dont get too many people ready to help you hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers\n2 too many ways to lose money whether its the convenience of zepto blinkit or the expensive goods over there you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nbut bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\npros\n1 the heart i never lived in bhubaneswar my hometown is in keonjhar the can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved here was because i was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents\n\nand i dont regret one bit\n\nlike

eyeliner\n\nthis reminds me of the maybelline hyperglossy eyeliner in texture wear etc but the finish is matte it doesnt smudge when lightly rubbed or when water falls on it but peels offdisintegrates when exposed to water and rubbed for this reason i wouldnt recommend this if youre going to be sweating a lot or actively getting wet in the rain long wearing i wore it at around 630 am before going to work and it lasted till at least 230pm or so before it started showing slight signs of wear in the inner corner which tends to happen even with a lot of more expensive eyeliners layers really well so if you want or need to touch up you can do that in a few seconds no problem great for everyday use or if you only wear eyeliner once in a while if you dont normally have any issues with eyeliner smudging or transferring oily lids etc the quality is really good too it didnt irritate my eyes or anything if you have sensitivereactive eyes obviously be careful it is worth noting that insight is one of the cheaper brands that actually mentions all its safety and nontoxicity certifications on its website which is reassuring will definitely repurchase and will update if my experience changes as ive only used it a few times till now \n\nwriting on the packaging has already worn offlol \n\ndries matte\n\nafter 78 hours slight wear in the inner corner but mostly intact and the colour remains intense difference is not noticeable in person\n\n\n\ncurling your eyelashes after washing your face\n\ndisclaimer  youre quite literally playing with fire and potentially hot metal also just like curling hair with eyelashes too there is a danger of breakage damage etc try at your own risk \n\nive been passionate about curling my eyelashes for years now as the difference it makes to my long but zerocurl eyelashes they actually grow downwards is immense ive had my shu uemura lash curler which fits my eye shape perfectly for more than 15 years and it still works perfectly when i curl my lashes during the day or in the evening its all good the problem is when im rushing to work in the morning and have to wash my face or shower and do my makeup immediately thereafter i realised that my eyelashes are not completely dry when i am curling them and that affected the resultless to almost no curl no amount of dabbing with a towel makes a difference the only thing that does give me the result i seek is heating up my lash curler somehow the heat dries up the residual moisture and the curl is much more pronounced i thought of using my blow dryer wellknown tip nothing new but plugging it up heating up the curler and then wrapping the cord nicely and storing it back in its rightful place is just too time consuming when you have exactly 15 minutes max to get ready recently i came across the kbeauty tip of heating up a wooden stick with a lighter and using that to curl or recurl your lashes after mascara i tried this but part of the stick i used user error not the best kind of stick started to singe break off and almost fell into my eyes yikes i noped right out of that idea earlier id also come across a video of someone who used a lighter to heat up their lash curler directly with fire at first i didnt want to try this as the idea of heated metal possibly burning my eyelid was terrifying even to me ive done a lot of stupid experiments in the name of beauty and curiosity in my youth finally though i gave in and ordered a 35 lighter from zepto and cautiously heated up my lash curler only the top half as shown in the pic surprisingly if you use the low setting of the lighter and do a few quick swipes across the length dont hold the flame in one place too long it doesnt even get that hot the one time it did i just put my hands on the metal and the heat transferred to my hands and cooled it down enough for safe use i would even say that while using a lighter you have even more control on how much youre heating it up as opposed to a blow dryer where you might end up heating the whole thing and burning yourself complete game changer lashes on fleek all day every day \n\n\n\n\n\n","154":"hello ladies enbies and other gender queer folks im planning

Why not put it in places where it actually contributes to society.\n\nI don't want to be rude but your statement comes across as a bit naive and coming from idealism instead of realism. We live in capitalistic society. 10 min delivery apps exist because of the same reason Amazon exists.\n\nHumans want things. These apps remove friction. Stepping down from your apartment requires effort. Walking or driving to get food or other things requires effort.\nWhat labor exploitation? These delivery guys are making 8-10x the money they were making previously \n\nPeople have moved real far from their homes because the earning opportunity and demand is so high.\n\nStep down and get some food \u2014 have you ever been to India dude? I would step down and fall into an open manhole and never be able to get food. \n\nClearly you have no clue what you\u2019re talking about nor know how much real demand there is for such an app in India and other developing countries.\nThat business model isn't sustainable, it basically pressures riders (which aren't even employed, they're on commission), to take unnecessary risks that puts them and other people in danger.\n\nWe've had some startups in Spain with a similar idea: Groceries in under 10 minutes. But they are mostly gone now.\nBecause investors enable BS startups like that. These \u201cinvestors\u201d are looking to launder their ill-gotten gains, and what better vessel than to dump money into copy-paste churn-and-burn startups led by tech grifters? Not sure why we don\u2019t talk about how VC is a massive massive money laundering machine for the moneyed, and it gets especially worse in \u201cnew money\u201d regions like India\u2026 India, BTW, is THE definition of \u201cnew money\u201d.\n\nSOURCE: I will never invest with Indian VCs again. And I am talking well known \u201cname brand\u201d individuals.\nI am not sure how they are managing to cook the food and deliver it in under 10 minutes. Maybe they have limited inventory? I don't know. What I do know is, the delivery person will break 10 traffic rules just to be on time. Plus, injuries to himself or anyone on the road. Plus there is this other thing where people are ready to risk themselves for money. You cannot claim that zomato or swiggy is liable for any damage either. Overall its a win win for these companies and they are just pushing the envelope, and one day it will all break.","3":"It's just a ploy to raise money from VCs.\n\nVCs themselves mostly fund money because they want to exit off the next raise, so they want to put in money into the \"hottest\" thing that they find.\nBecause bigger temporary revenues= bigger stock prices\/ investor money \/ IPO. Ultimately it\u2019s a game to unload these unrealistic valuations on the retail investors. Nothing else. The owners and PE VC firms get to cash out.\nJust like Amazon and Walmart make money off of their own labels.\n\nZomato will make more money selling coffee from their own cafe (cloud kitchen) vs delivering coffee from Starbucks.\n\nWith Blinkit, Zomato went after kirana stores.. With these 10 mins food delivery they're going after the unknown small dhabas \/ restaurants \/ home kitchen.\nExactly my point.. they are just playing passing the parcel \ud83d\udce6 game to increase the valuation and grt a good exit.\nMost of the food that gets sold follows a Pareto principle with key food items being Biryani\/Pizza and a few other Hero products that get sold the most. 10 minutes of food delivery doesn't have to mean, 2 minutes of preparation! For high-volume goods, their demand can be predicted and thereby a fast predictive supply chain can be built to service this demand. For low-volume SKUs, these brands can quote higher service duration\/timelines. \n\nAs far as it being sustainable etc is a question that these firms need to answer, if enough people keep ordering and the retention is sustained, this can be solved. Not sure why people are being so paranoid, the same happened with Grocery delivery as well, if grocery is a 10 min thing then ready-made food absolutely makes sense. Quality needs to be figured out and I guess, it will eventually be","4":"how is zeal's performance?\nBro how is zeal and silver shade performance...and where to get them at cheap price?\nwhere did u buy maison from\nI have al Dirgham and I dont see any bold-ness or spicy notes.

The Terminids themselves are displaying unprecedented behavior, becoming increasingly erratic and hostile\u2014even to each other.

They deliberately use non-standard product quantities like 450g\/900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg, making comparisons harder for customers. Additionally, they push customers into purchasing VIP memberships by showcasing misleading discounts, which are actually deducted from the membership amount, creating a false sense of savings. Even their cow milk, which used to come in 500ml packs, has been reduced to 450ml for new customers. These practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust.

For example, 500g\/3 bananas on Zepto costs you Rs40. While on Amazon Fresh or Flipkart Minutes the same costs you Rs 30 while a roadside thela would sell you 6 bananas for the same price. Not sure if Zepto is keen to win this war, but surely they are losing it. In Noida sector where i live, a year back Zepto riders were a common things to see. Not anymore.\nZepto is building itself to be acquired and not to exist. \n\nAnd that \u20b9454\/- on Pizza ? Via Swiggy ??\nZepto is burning someone else's money to create hype and then be brought out. They are not in it for the long run.\nI never installed or used it. I prefer bbdaily or fresh, nothing else. I don\u2019t want 15 mins rocket fast delivery, it\u2019s bad for local kirana guys as well as for us\nQuick commerce is very important for essentials.Specially in MT1 cities.\n\nEven though quick commerce is trying to venture into the world of regular commodities ( including fashion) , it's still not known how the public of the country will behave.  Its a bet they have to take.\n\nthey have to try exploring the options or else from where the next set of growth will be coming? \n\n\n\nRegarding the price difference, there can be multiple factors. \n\n1) the margin at both the platforms will be different. Amazon buying huge quantities will benefit with a better margin compared to Zepto ( a new kid in the block with little quantities). Hence they are not able to match the price.\n\n\n2) prices of commodities vary in minutes depending on traffic. While amazon price matches quite fast, zepto might still be developing the tech and till the time some one notices the diff. It's too late and they end up losing customers.","51":"Feeling good, never used this app.\n**Zepto Tai.**\nThe 40% rate is actually correct. The GST on aerated drinks is 40% (28% and 12% compensation cess). As per GST law since the principal supply is taxed at 40%, the related services like delivery and handling charges will also be taxed at 40%.\nSwiggy increased their platform fee to Rs.10\nOrder above 100","52":"These are private companies. Stop treating them as if they have some public service responsibility. They don't, their objective is to make the highest revenue over the lowest expense.\nIf you have any issues with them charging stop using their service\nBecause, they can?\nI've seen this a lot of time, please know this before posting it here. \"Everything is cost for YOUR laziness\"\nSmall cart fee is for when they won't break even for the dark store and its employees packing your order.  \nA higher cart value would cover the packing charges, supermarkets that do home delivery of groceries over phone call\/WhatsApp wont take orders for less than 500Rs because it should cover packing and delivery charges.  \n\nDelivery charges are for the delivery service...\nActually they can't charge a huge amount collectively so they divided it into parts \nFor customers satisfaction \ud83d\ude09","53":"because unlike what you see on social media, majority of India is still poor or not aware enough to consume products that most Indian startups are offering , quick commerce or fashion will simply fail in rural India \n\nmost Indian startups like Zepto\/Zomato employ shady taxes to max out their profit margin from the 10 million userbase\nIt's a good way to think about the TAM but in one of the nikhil kamat podcasts Kishor Biyani gave a better one I believe. He segregated India into their consumption patterns as In India 1, India 2 and India 3. \n\nIt's worth looking into.\nThis makes sense. Skewed sense. Because:\n\n  \n1) Our country's constitution upholds the Right to Equality - so Zepto and other business can be legally sued for breaching this. \n\n2) The 10 Million \/ 20 Million will wisen up and treat dark models as 'scams'. They'll inevitably discard or abandon such apps \/ sites or businesses relying on such dark models.\nI think we should focus more on software businesses and startups. Think about the TAM of Google or youtube or facebook. They aren't just targetting top 10% but anyone with access to a smartphone. And not just in India but worldwide. New innovative revenue streams must be thought rather than all those we deliver you pay kind of revenue. Till the time we don't do that, America will take all the profit from the bottom layer of our population.\nIsn't there an error in your calculations? 10 mil new phones are being added each year.

The difference is most of them are B2B and go into Ycombinator and get different levels of funding instead of going through IPO etc in india. B2B is much more profitable then B2C for small startups. I think you should do more research...\nFun fact - a founder friend of mine applied to shark tank. Was rejected as one of the key criteria was he\/she should be able to fluently converse in Hindi\nA lot of SaaS startups that branched out of Freshworks & Zoho mafia have Tamil Co-founders .\n\nA few good companies I can recall:  [Factors.ai](https:\/\/Factors.ai), Everstage, Rocketlane, Kissflow, Spendflo, M2P , Chargebee, Survey Sparrow, Atomic HQ, Mad Street Deb,  Growfin,  Ippopay - Most of these are seed and series A type companies.\n\nIn terms of B2C startups, I can think of Pickyourtrail , Carat Lane, Thyrocare from the top of my mind.\n\nIMO we have a decent number of startup operators working in top startups. I feel we just have a handful of VCs who are based out of TN.\n\nWe can definitely do better in all these fronts.\nCheck out the Start Genome report on various startup ecosystems around the world. Chennai's ecosystem is minuscule and yet across the globe, there are lots of people from Tamil\/TN backgrounds in this industry globally.  So, I don't think that it is some sort of lack of talent but I think there is a massive cultural issue in that risk-taking seems to be frowned upon and it is a real pet peeve of mine.   \n\n\nSecondly, as a city, Chennai lags far behind the other major start-up hubs in terms of the social infrastructure required to build a start-up ecosystem. Look up the world's major start-up cities and they are all highly liberal. The morons in our city seem to think that this means that we need to have a lot of pubs and bars, but that's not the point. It is more a case of having an environment that allows intellectual curiosity to flourish, an openness to outsiders, and a willingness to live and let live. As someone from a fairly standard middle-class\/upper-middle-class family, I think this is hugely lacking in Chennai compared to our peers like Bangalore etc. If I remember correctly, the total ecosystem value of Chennai was around $11b while Bangalore's ecosystem was valued at $168b. This will inevitably lead to talent drain and momentum, while other cities will wither and wane.   \n\n\nHopefully, the new government will try to arrest this and it looks like they're trying to do that somewhat with some of the recent start-up discussion panels with notable economists like Arvind Subramanium and Raghuram Rajan coming to Chennai. Without some drastic action and soon, the city will be left in the dust.\nWell, if you count new briyani shops and Real estate companies as startups, we far out number em. There are many more in IT who constantly compares what companies pay and whats the market value of inherited land and wants to de-evolve back to farming so that they retain control of inheritance wealth. Growing \"the food\" (Obviously for profit) is far more social service to them than creating a startup that brings employment to masses that don't have a land to cultivate. \n\n\nAnd then the parties. The politicians are just too smart. It  requires far more intellectual power to go around them and establish the starts up here.\n\nIts easy to be a king in the land of blind. But when the population is too smart, it's exponentially tough to climb without the legs getting pulled down.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's impossible. As the over smart people are driven out of the state, there comes a time when politicians realize it is impossible for politicians to grow their wealth by not letting the worker classes to build up wealth. Then comes the up cycle again","60":"They sell it at no profit - no loss or even sell it at loss to attract new customers. \n\nYour mother is going to have her mind blown one day when she discovers how cheap things are online.\nThe idea is long-term term the shop where your mom buys closes down.

For example take Arun. \nWhy Indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity, Once SRK said this \u201cgurbat me creativity nahi hoti\u201d meaning there\u2019s no creativeness when you\u2019re poor, and I personally believe it\u2019s the reason. You see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background. Other thing I believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture. A mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person. \nTimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade. \nPeople are now accepting Entrepreneurship is something in India but still we have a long way to go.\nIndia is kind of late to the technology scene. I remember, in 1997-1998 there used to be to 1-2 computer hardware shops in Nehru Place. While in US, dotcom scene was so booming, which eventually led to the bubble in 2000. We were so far apart. \n\nYou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 10-20 years. Our startup scene only started in around 2007. It takes a good 10-15 years to build a solid foundation. Yes, we lag behind & will continue to lag behind USA but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less. There are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news, which is good actually-\n\nGrey Orange, Pine Labs, Postman, ChargeBee, Rivigo .. and so on.\nZoho is an outlier currently. Another 5-10 years more and we'll have more Indian startups that'll be used globally.\nI think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success. As you mentioned, in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that. \n\nTake Zerodha for example, they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a value-added product. \n\nAnother example would be FInshots (Ditto Insurance), which started off with making finance accessible to the layman, currently working towards making insurance available to everyone, excellent product, and excellent founders, going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight.\n\nI'm sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game, which will organically shine when their time comes.\nThe current startup scene in India, fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for \"unicorn\" status, is  misguided. It fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy, often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class. Zomato, Byju's, and Swiggy are classic examples.\n\nPerhaps a more sustainable approach would be for India to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets. As Peter Thiel emphasizes in his book \"Zero to One,\" true startups should focus on creating something entirely new, not just replicating existing models. Zoho and Zerodha are commendable examples of Indian companies that have done just that.\n\nIndia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, with a higher proportion of self-employed individuals than perhaps any other nation (except maybe China). Government and investors should have prioritized established, homegrown successes like Naga Mills, Haldirams, and Everest. These companies, admired internationally for filling genuine gaps, represent India's true entrepreneurial strength. Instead, the focus seems to be on loss-making ventures like Ola and Swiggy, businesses arguably unsuited to the Indian market's current needs. \n\nPerhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging India is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population. By fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs, India can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, not just a select few.\n\nY'all stop being copy cats...","107":"Has anyone tried it!?\nThis is the best price you can get it for.

If I have a product A who's MRP is say 100 rs. \nI pay zepto a fix margin. So 30% (norm. It's higher for blinkit). So they pay me only 70rs. So i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nSo take case of discounts. They put it for say 80rs. So instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer. So they balance it 100-80 = 20. They raise a debit note agaisnt it. And the brand has to pay it back.\n\nNot only that. The banners. The placement on top of search for keyword search. Everything is monetized. \n\nSo zeptos net profit is = margin from brands(30%avg) + Banners and marketing placements - cost of dark stores and delivery -tech cost - any marketing (ads and extra coupons)\n\nSo the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter. Blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs (new brands are asked for as high as 55%) and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs. Also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low.\n\nHave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions. But most discounts are borne at the source.\nQuick commerce is made for the growing riches in india, while India will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class, Dmart and Zepto both are not going anywere I think (only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth)\nPeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators. Look where we are now. Food for thought?\nHow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years?

But butcher shop can be cost effective. You can even make a deal with them, if you buy regularly. \n2) Make sure it's an alive chicken they are butchering, for quality. If you are eating everyday, you can have 150 GM of chicken(Calculate your protein req, and remove other protein sources). Problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces. Instead get 500 gm of chicken breast. I guess, there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm. Ask them not to chop it. (Chicken breast is a good source of lean protein)\n\n3) It's feasible if you use freezer. Go for 500 gm in the beginning. Adjust it as you go.\n\n4) This is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked. a) Always cook on low flame. b) Use non stick pan(atleast in the beginning) and make sure to close it with the lid while cooking (Trust me: It makes all the difference) c) I make chicken tandoori, and the marinade makes it soft. d) When it's juicy and glazed with far, you know your chicken is ready. But don't cook it more than 20 minutes. (I always use a tbsp of ghee)\nChicken legs and wings are easier to cook. It takes about 25 minutes. I marinade all of these for one hour.\n\n5) Someone else can help you here. I  take a lot of time to cook.\n\n6) Wings, breast, legs cook at different time and tastes different. Alternate your protein source with fish occasionally. Experiment with a lot of recipes. It's fun. \n\nGood luck\nI have a super easy recipe to make chicken curry that goes well with rice and dosas.

This is the best way to thaw your chicken.\n\n Do not keep it outside or submerge it in hot water to thaw."},"sort_order":{"0":"relevance","1":"relevance","2":"relevance","3":"relevance","4":"relevance","5":"relevance","6":"relevance","7":"relevance","8":"relevance","9":"relevance","10":"relevance","11":"relevance","12":"relevance","13":"relevance","14":"relevance","15":"relevance","16":"relevance","17":"relevance","18":"relevance","19":"relevance","20":"relevance","21":"relevance","22":"relevance","23":"relevance","24":"relevance","25":"relevance","26":"relevance","27":"relevance","28":"relevance","29":"relevance","30":"relevance","31":"relevance","32":"relevance","33":"relevance","34":"relevance","35":"relevance","36":"relevance","37":"relevance","38":"relevance","39":"relevance","40":"relevance","41":"relevance","42":"relevance","43":"relevance","44":"relevance","45":"relevance","46":"relevance","47":"relevance","48":"relevance","49":"relevance","50":"relevance","51":"relevance","52":"relevance","53":"relevance","54":"relevance","55":"relevance","56":"relevance","57":"relevance","58":"relevance","59":"relevance","60":"relevance","61":"relevance","62":"relevance","63":"relevance","64":"relevance","65":"relevance","66":"relevance","67":"relevance","68":"relevance","69":"relevance","70":"relevance","71":"relevance","72":"relevance","73":"relevance","74":"relevance","75":"relevance","76":"relevance","77":"relevance","78":"relevance","79":"relevance","80":"relevance","81":"relevance","82":"relevance","83":"relevance","84":"relevance","85":"relevance","86":"relevance","87":"relevance","88":"relevance","89":"relevance","90":"relevance","91":"relevance","92":"relevance","93":"relevance","94":"relevance","95":"relevance","96":"relevance","97":"relevance","98":"relevance","99":"relevance","100":"relevance","101":"relevance","102":"relevance","103":"relevance","104":"relevance","105":"relevance","106":"relevance","107":"relevance","108":"relevance","109":"relevance","110":"relevance","111":"relevance","112":"relevance","113":"relevance","114":"relevance","115":"relevance","116":"relevance","117":"relevance","118":"relevance","119":"relevance","120":"relevance","121":"relevance","122":"relevance","123":"relevance","124":"relevance","125":"relevance","126":"relevance","127":"relevance","128":"relevance","129":"relevance","130":"relevance","131":"relevance","132":"relevance","133":"relevance","134":"relevance","135":"relevance","136":"relevance","137":"relevance","138":"relevance","139":"relevance","140":"relevance","141":"relevance","142":"relevance","143":"relevance","144":"relevance","145":"relevance","146":"relevance","147":"relevance","148":"relevance","149":"relevance","150":"relevance","151":"relevance","152":"relevance","153":"relevance","154":"relevance"},"posttext":{"0":"India\u2019s Grocery wars A Deloitte report estimates Indian quick commerce to be a massive $40 Bn market by 2030.

Hotwheels car: smells kinda metallic and rusty. 0 performance. Its my favourite as it looks very cool\n\n2. Pendora scents noir en leather: Clone of Tom Ford's Ombre Leather. Got it yesterday for 1k from a friend who didn't like it and used it only twice. It might be a bit too early to call this my favourite, I know, BUT IT SMELLS SO DAMN GOOD to me. \nOpening: kind of spicy with the main note of cardamom(elaichi). This doesn't last very long though\nDry down: RICH and synthetic(but in the best way possible) ultra fine, refreshing leather. \nDefinitely not something I can use daily but I love it.\n\n3. Some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called Kannauj perfumes:\n I got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back. I've not smelt the original so I'm not sure how well they copy it but by itself, it's great value for money. Can't really smell any tobacco but it's sweet and fresh. Also performace is pretty good.\n\n4. Salvatore Ferragamo Bright leather:\nGot this off of zepto on a big discount for 3.4k. opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit. Dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance. Very pleasant. Not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather.\n\n5. Jaguar Classic black:\nMy daily go to. Got it for 2.4k on blinkit\/zepto(I don't remember)Very generic and mass pleasing. Can't really put my hand on what notes it uses but it's fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge. Great summer frag but can be used all year round. Moderate performance. The bottle is so dishevelled because I keep it in my bag for school everyday.\n\n6. Ajmal silver shade: \nI use it sometimes when I get bored of jaguar. Got it for 1.2k on zepto. Fresh, citrusy and metallic. Can't go wrong with this. Also I've heard it's a clone of creed's silver mountain water but idk how far that's true. Performance is decent, same as jaguar classic black. \n\n7. Decant of beardo whiskey smoke:\nFriend gave this to me for free. Spicy winter frag. Pretty mid tho. Don't use it much. Nothing else to say here\n\n8. VILLAIN edp:\nThis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 I USED TO LOVE THIS and I finished a whole bottle of it within a year. Sweet, dark and fresh smelling. But this new bottle just isn't as strong and performace sucks. Barely lasts 30 minutes. Idk if they changed its formulation or what. It's just not the same anymore. The only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia. \n\n9. Adidas ice dive:\nGot gifted this by my cousins. Smell is pretty decent. Fresh, citrusy and sporty. Would've been ranked way higher if it performed. Barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection.\n\n10. Ustra Scuba cologne:\nThis is the only fragrance in my collection I actually DESPISE. Supposed to be fresh and aquatic. But it's just synthetic, harsh and a complete mess. Literally nothing to like abt it.

After ignoring many promotional calls I paid attention to one and heard Zepto delivers food?! Has anyone tried it out? Is it good and fresh? ","8":"Is HSBC Live+ not offering 10% Cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions? Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","9":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Karan Johar, Rahul Dravid, Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit invested in Swiggy.  \n  \nWhat are you waiting for?  \n  \nMe: \u201cMeaningful information to take a call.\u201d  \n  \nInformation 1: Swiggy IPO is a mix of fresh issue of equity shares totaling to \u20b93,750 crore and an offer-for-sale of 18.52 crores equity shares by existing shareholders.  \n  \nMeaning: Roughly 60% of IPO investors\u2019 money will be used to give an exit to the VCs like such as Accel, Prosus, and Tencent. Only 40% will be used by the company for it's operations.  \n  \nInformation 2: Swiggy reduced its losses to \u20b92,350 crore in FY 24, down 43% from last year.  \n  \nMeaning: It's a loss-making company and looks like it will continue to be making losses for some more time.  \n  \nInformation 3: \u20b9559.1 crore of the fresh issue will be used for setting up dark stores  \n  \nMeaning: It's betting big on quick commerce. As per THE KEN, Swiggy instamart is the slowest in delivery time and the average order value is almost the same as Zepto and BB Now. Blinkit is way ahead of it in all parameters. So somewhere needed there.  \n  \nSummary: Pre IPO investing is generally a difficult call. It's got a 50:50 chance. I am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets.  \n  \nIf you found this post useful, share it with your friend.","14":"Any retail stores stocking Fisherman\u2019s Friend mints? \nHas anyone come across the Fisherman\u2019s Friend mint lozenges singles or multipacks in retail stores in the city?

The SES Song of the People made an emergency landing where ship repairs and sterilization could be carried out under dissident cover.\n\nObservations & Conclusion:\n\nSuper Earth's warnings about the Gloom were not unfounded; Spacecraft that travel into the cloud risk certain death. Gloom spores adversely affect computers and electronic devices at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Damage to electronics and data banks increases with spore concentration, navigational systems will scramble under Gloom interference. Do not listen to the Gloom. Spore cloud causes hull damage through friction and has a mild corrosive property. The Gloom is not simply a collection of spores, it is a thing that acts with purpose as evident from its \"desire\" to consume my Super Destroyer. It sustains and commands Terminids within the cloud with uncanny coordination. A Termicide gas cover can give a spaceship time enough to escape its grasp but there's no guarantee it won't adapt... How did humanity engineer such an unstoppable force?\n\nWe have scraped the SES Song of the People for Gloom spore samples that will be sent to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Research Center along with this report.\n\nAlthough the expedition ended in disaster, I hope what can be gleaned from this will be of some use to our cause and help find some answers.\n\n[Original art by me](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qnnumxas7cld1.jpg?width=1023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c59cf10d685afafe02fdcee6aea5a15b3a7bf362)\n\nVera Libertas!","16":"Zepto Mostly Delivers Rotten Food - Anyone Else Facing This? So, I recently ordered some groceries from Zepto, because they have free delivery charges. But what I received was anything but fresh, several items were either rotten or close to it. I tried contacting their customer support, hoping for an easy refund, I was ready for replacement as well, but it seems like I have to beg just to get what I paid for.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences with Zepto or other quick commerce platforms? It\u2019s frustrating that they promise quality and speed, but if there\u2019s a problem, they\u2019re conveniently \u201cunavailable\u201d or dismissive. Why are these platforms allowed to operate this way? It feels like they\u2019re putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards.\n\nIs there any way to get them to take accountability. Or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service?","17":"Zepto: High Time For You To Turn Ethical This experience is a culmination of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by Zepto (as a quick-commerce provider) operating in Sarjapur Road locality here in Bengaluru in particular and across India in general. Zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service; however, it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least. One day it is poor Quality Control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies \/ fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 15-20 mins minimum to even reach your community \/ apartment even during non-peak hours. Their Customer Support Team does not have any empathy to begin with. They tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie Customer Support Associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced Customer Support Associate who will start a seemingly never-ending saga of questions and unnecessary cross-checks with their internal logistics and quality control teams - all when you are still on chat with them. The whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on Zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 30-45 minutes in trying to relay their concerns and\/or reach a closure. I also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code \u201cFree Delivery\u201d before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have Zepto membership or not. One has to wonder as to why so forward-thinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such tech-savvy quick commerce apps COULD NOT apply a simple auto-logic to apply \u201cFree Delivery\u201d as and when a customer or patron\u2019s cart value reaches minimum order value by default. These practices not only expose Zepto\u2019s dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers\u2019 money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value. Zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers\u2019 hard-earned money using cheap con tricks. This is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating!!!\n\nHope this effort to expose Zepto and its greedy intentions create some much-needed noise and uproar amongst Zepto\u2019s senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\u2026\n\n  #TimeToChangeZepto #StopCheating","18":"Good Vegetable Delivery Services like DeepRooted (RIP) Recently, the service DeepRooted was discontinued and transferred to services like Zepto, Instamart, and Amazon Fresh.\n\nBefore, when my family used to order from DeepRooted, we used to buy stuff like Bokchoi, Asparagus, Edamame, and other exotic Green-leafies. Now none of them appear to be available on the aforementioned successors (Zepto, Instamart, and Amazon Fresh). \n\nDoes anybody here know of services at par with or better than DeepRooted offering these slightly exotic vegetables and fruits?\n\nMy mom asked me for alternatives, and I am turning to r\/Bangalore for answers. \nThank you.","19":"Zepto Scammed Me with Spoiled Vegetables! I recently placed an order with Zepto, expecting fresh vegetables for my family, but what arrived was far from fresh\u2014completely spoiled, rotten, and unusable. I was shocked at the poor quality, especially considering the premium I paid for this delivery service.\n\nWhen I contacted their customer care team to report the issue, I was met with the rudest response imaginable. Instead of offering a solution or even an apology, the representative I spoke with dismissed my concerns entirely and made no effort to rectify the situation. It felt like they just didn\u2019t care about their customers or the quality of their service.\n\nI\u2019ve never experienced such bad customer service. I wanted to share this to warn others who might be considering using Zepto\u2014this is not the kind of service you expect from a company that promises convenience and quality.\n\nSurprisingly some of my friends also have encountered such incidents with Zepto recently.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues with Zepto?","20":"Blue-collar recruitment platform Vahan.ai picks up $10M led by Khosla Ventures #Vahanai, an AI-powered marketplace for India's 300 million blue-collared workforce, has raised $10 million in a Series B funding round led by Khosla Ventures, founded by Vinod Khosla. Y Combinator, US-based VC firm Gaingels, and Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma also participated.  \n\nThe company will use the fresh capital to expand into industries such as manufacturing and retail as these sectors.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media.

Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights.

Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","27":"Toxic work culture ft. Zepto I have been working with Zepto for a year now. It is the most toxic work culture.

This way, it gives others some guidance, even though it might not apply to every individual.\n\n3. **About adding new companies:**  \n   Someone pointed out that I had added Zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers. Thanks for that!  \n\n   Now, I\u2019m checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list. If your suggested company isn\u2019t on the list yet, it\u2019s because I\u2019m still verifying their hiring status.\n\n4. **Focus on experienced professionals:**  \n   This list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals, but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference. It can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures.\n\n\nEdit:-\n\nSorting it Alphabetically so that it is easier to find company names\nChanging Low Paying to Mid Paying\n\nChanges made so far \n- Removed VMWare\n- Moved Broadcom from Low Paying good WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Twitter\n- Moved Ola from Unknown WLB to mid paying bad WLB\n- Moved Browserstack from Unknown WLB to Remote First\n- Moved Rippling from Unknown WLB to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Zepto to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added SAP Labs to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved ServiceNow from Unknown WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Moved RedHat from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Good WLB\n- Moved Cred from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Bad WLB\n- Added MathWorks to Good Paying Good WLB\n- Added Akamai to Remote First\n- Added MasterCard to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Smallcase to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved BigBasket from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Grab from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Moved Gojek from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Added HashedIn to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Walmart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Flipkart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Zeta to Mid Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Phonepe to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Zerodha from the list\n- Added Autodesk to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Unacademy from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Agoda Bangkok to Visa Sponsorship outside US\n- Added Zoho to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Freshworks to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Atlassian from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Directi from high paying Unknown WLB to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Datadog from Remote first to mid paying good WLB\n- Added Confluent to Remote first ","30":"Beware!

Time is 1:48 am right now and I decided to order some snacks while watching inception, this was my first time ordering with zepto so i got a free premium pass with this order resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products. \n\nSo, the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy I have ever talked to before. Time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app, he greeted me with \"Radhe radhe\" and i greeted him back, the order was prepaid. So, he takes out my order, making small talk and being very polite, talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever(?), then he apologized for taking so long (he didn't) and calling so often for directions wagera(he didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons) I didn't know what was coming and I just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why he's so enthusiastic about it. He said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks \"Actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h, budget toght h rasin vi nai h\", I was thinking to myself 'why wouldn't he just give me my order, he's just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture' and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me \"My dad passed away a year ago\" he said with a slight tremble in his voice, \"I am having to provide for the whole family and I am not being able to, if you could, please help me out, I promise I will return you the money next week\" he said, now completely in tears and I dont know what to do, I am terrible in those situations and I just want to take my order and get back to watching Inception, I feel sorry for the guy but I dont have shit on me, I am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and I only ordered those snacks because I have only had 2 meals in 2 days, I finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and I'm gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home (but that's a different story), I cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week, even my dad died a little more than a year ago, I can relate to his pain, and if he is really telling the truth then I cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a Delivery boy. \n\nSo anyways, he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house, and I told him that I dont have any money on me and that I can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops, but he insisted that I check my gpay to see if I have some money, I dont need to check, I have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money I'm offering him, but he just kept asking for more than just 30, 40rs and I had had it with him, I told him I am sorry but I cant help him out, that I am also in a crappy situation in life right now, that I couldn't help him out even if I wanted to and finally he said its okay, he wiped his tears, \"radhe radhe\", handed me my order and then I left.\n\nThis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and I checked to see if there's a tipping option on Zepto but I couldn't find it.

Flipkart was recently in the news for charging iPhone users more than Android users for the same product. Similarly, Urban Company faced backlash in 2022 for pre-selecting premium services, leading customers to unknowingly pay extra.\n\nDark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users.

However if you're working on a venture with a reasonable AOV required to sustain and grow, your target market is the 10 million who can afford to.\n\nI am not talking about low cost services and products that require constant funding from VCs or some other chum to stay afloat. If you forget about these VC subsidised offerings, and focus on growing on a healthy trajectory, these are the only people you need to think about. \n\nThis is how I arrived at the 10 million. By looking at phone sales data. \n\nApple is projected to sell at least 12 million Iphones in India in 2024. Let's say 6 million are buying the high end expensive pro phones and they're doing this in India, which means they live here and will continue to live here and not run away abroad. \n\nLet's give the rest of the 4  million to Samsung and others. \nSamsung sells a lot of phones but only a few million high end ones. Those are the only ones you need to focus on. \n\nYour target market is around 10 million people and your projected market is another 10 million at best. India is experiencing mass emigration to other countries, extreme inequality, very high taxes. It is very unlikely your target market will grow past 20 million in the next 5 years. \n\nForget about the 1.5 billion people argument, 99% won't be useful for your startup. Focus on the 10 million, plan for the 20 million. \n\n","54":"This is what i got from zepto diwali box How lucky is too much lucky? aur mood kharab hogya ye dekhke\ud83d\ude2d","55":"Ordered Banana from Zepto and found Worms.

These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns. By using a budget device, you might avoid being flagged as a high-value target.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: This is especially helpful for users in the age range of Gen Z, as they're frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns.

One thing that kept me thinking was why don't we see a lot of successful startups at national level either originate from TN or cofounded by Tamilians ?  \nIn the last decade the amount of FDI, India received is just crazy. Dogsh\\*t companies have been able to somehow convince investors to fund them hugely.

I hope this helps! Share your stock picks in the comments along with the corporate life cycle stage they belong to after understanding the concept.\n\nGiving you one more framework to understand how companies and business models evolve and how to identify them at early stage of their corporate life cycle and get multi bagger returns. you can integrate this framework with the high quality framework to have a more refined filter according to your result expectations.\n\nJust like people, businesses grow, mature, and eventually decline, and their success depends on how well they act their age. **The corporate life cycle, which has six stages\u2014start-up, product development, high growth, maturity, decline, and demise**.\n\nEarly-stage companies burn cash and rely on future potential, while mature firms generate stable profits and dividends. Declining firms face tough decisions to returning cash to stakeholders. For valuation, **start-ups are valued based on potential and narrative**, as in the case of\u00a0Zomato and Swiggy, while mature firms like\u00a0**TCS**\u00a0rely on cash flows and profits. Declining companies, are valued on their liquidation potential.\n\nStart-ups, like\u00a0Zomato\u00a0in its early days, are idea-driven and burn cash to grow, often with no profits, so you cannot use the framework you need to value a mature business for startups.\n\nProduct phase companies have scaling challenges be it local scaling or global scaling. Business and industry that have the scale elements are multi bagger because only few companies and business model can scale.(Varun beverages, COCA COLA, dominos, software companies anything that can scale and  generate profits and fcf and be successfully implemented in different geographies will give multi baggers) That's why one should focus on asset light business models which requires less capital to scale.\n\nThe\u00a0high-growth phase\u00a0brings rapid revenue growth but still requires reinvestment. So you will see that the companies generates free cash flow but reinvest all for future growth, Amazon did this for more than 20 years because they had so many reinvestment opportunities.(**This is the best phase to invest because you make most of the returns(50-100-200 baggers) when the company transforms from growth to mature stage**)\n\nMature firms\u00a0like\u00a0HDFC Bank\u00a0focus on steady profits and defending market share, while companies in\u00a0decline.\n\n**You can look at your portfolio and identify which stage of corporate cycle your stock is and drop in the comment section the name of the stock and in which phase of business cycle your stock is.**\n\nYoung firms attract traders and speculative bets, requiring long-term patience to have mutilabggers while Mature firms appeal to value investors.\u00a0\n\n**Leadership is an essential element of each phase of growth and it needs to change with time to increase the longevity and returns for investors.**\n\nStart-ups need visionaries (\u00a0Depeinder Goyal at Zomato or Brian Chesky at AIRBN or if you look at the past Narayan Murthy at Infosys) because they have to make bold and long term decision and should have risk taking capabilities , growth-phase companies require scale-focused leaders, and mature businesses need defenders of stability (Sanjiv Mehta\u00a0at Hindustan Unilever).\u00a0\n\nUnderstanding the corporate life cycle is critical to know your return profile on your investments.If you want to have multi baggers, you cannot have a 50 or 100x from Infosys or ITC because they have crossed the 3 essential stages and are now in mature and ageing stage. Some companies use acquisition to reignite the growth phase but usually its not successful.Mature companies make costly acquisition and burn shareholder value.\n\nOne more insight is that **Tech companies scale faster but age quickly, they have a shorter lifespan in comparison to a FMCG, Medical device maker, Pharma company ,Banks etc.(Philip morris, diageo,** Hermes **have survived** centurie and in Indies case asian paints, ITC, Pharma companies have survived several decades, on the other hand tech companies like Satyam computer or Nokia have a smaller life span of 30-40 years)\n\nIf you are value investor focus on things that are not going to change in this digital word, and if you want growth look for disruptors that are going to change the future landscape of a particular industry.\n\nSmart management and companies who look to create value for their share holders accept their life stage and act accordingly.A start-up should not over-leverage itself because it can risk its existence recent example would be Byjus , and a mature company shouldn\u2019t risk its stability chasing lost growth by making expensive acquisitions.\n\n|**Stage**|**Indian Companies**|**Characteristics**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Start-Up**|Zepto, |High growth potential, no profits, heavy cash burn, reliant on VC funding.|\n|**Product Development**|BluSmart Mobility, Pharmeasy, Ather Energy, Ola Electric, [Cult.Fit](http:\/\/Cult.Fit), Meesho|Building product-market fit, scaling challenges, high reinvestment, uncertain profitability.|\n|**High Growth**|Infoedge,Lenskart,Nykaa, Delhivery, Zomato,  Policybazaar, Swiggy|Rapid revenue growth, high operational costs, evolving profitability.|\n|**Mature**|HDFC Bank, TCS, Asian Paints, Reliance Industries, Infosys, HUL|Stable revenues, consistent profits, strong market share, focus on efficiency, and dividends.|\n|**Decline**|ITC Cigarettes, SpiceJet, BHEL, Tata Steel Europe, MTNL, CCD,COAL India|Shrinking revenues, high costs, competitive pressures, profitability struggles.|\n|**Demise**|Reliance Communications, Jet Airways, Videocon Industries, Kingfisher Airlines, Satyam, Deccan Chronicle|Bankruptcy, restructuring, or irrelevance due to poor management or market shifts.|\n\nThe corporate life cycle is a practical lens for Investment and it strengthens the checklist framework and should be used according to your risk profile and investment expectations.

","81":"Questions About Zepto's Growth Story Recent allegations suggest Zepto charges different prices based on your phone model. While unverified, this claim opens a larger question about how India's newest unicorn is reshaping retail through data.\n\nZepto's growth is undeniable: From 50 dark stores in 2021 to over 750 today, with plans for 1,200 by March 2025. Their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from \u20b977 crore to \u20b9250-300 crore. Yet investors have poured in $1.35 billion in 2024 alone. Why?\n\nThe answer lies in what they're really building: a massive consumer behavior database. Each dark store isn't just a warehouse - it's a data collection center tracking thousands of households' purchasing patterns, brand preferences, and price sensitivities.\n\nFMCG companies are noticing. Industry sources indicate major brands are creating Zepto-specific products and packages. The power dynamic is shifting - when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers, traditional retail relationships change.\n\nThe expansion raises questions. In Mumbai alone, over 200 local retail spaces now house Zepto's dark stores. Each requires specific zoning permissions, affecting local real estate markets. Meanwhile, internal documents mention development of \"back-end mother hubs\" automation systems, even as the company aggressively hires with above-market salaries.\n\nTheir \"SuperSaver\" feature requires minimum orders of \u20b9999 - a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior. Combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics, it suggests a broader plan for market control.\n\nThe environmental impact deserves scrutiny. With 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips, the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured.\n\nZepto promises an IPO within 24 months while planning major operational changes. Their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by March 2025. These timelines create interesting questions about their long-term strategy.\n\nWhat we're witnessing might be more than quick commerce. It's potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience. Every order, every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how India shops.\n\nThe implications warrant discussion. How will this affect local retail networks? What happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value? When does convenience become control?\n\nThese aren't hypothetical concerns. The next time your phone lights up with a Zepto notification, consider: You might be feeding data into a system that's fundamentally changing India's retail landscape, one 10-minute delivery at a time.","82":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Aug 19th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter.

This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Its effect to set **Super Fusion** \non the field after excluding four monsters from the Graveyard is a reference to the anime card **[Scriptures on the Evil Thoughts](https:\/\/yugipedia.com\/wiki\/Wicked_Canon)**, whose effect was meant to be a ritual to fully complete the **Super Fusion** card, and its effect to allow **Evil HERO** \nFusion Monsters to be summoned without using **Dark Fusion** is a reference to how those monsters could be inexplicably summoned with **Super Fusion** in the anime.\n* **Neos Lord's** appearance is based on **Elemental HERO Neos** inside the armor worn by Supreme King Judai in the anime. \n * Official summon chant: \"O ruler of all HEROs! Harness the power of darkness to mete out justice! Appear before me! Elemental HERO Neos Lord!!\"\n * Attack name: **Wrath of Neos Lord**\n * Effect name: **Domination Force**\n* **Hellback Fire** (a pun on **backfire**) is the effect name of the original **Elemental HERO Inferno Wing** in the anime. The card also shares many resemblances with **Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Flame Shoot**, a similarly named card.\n* The background in the artwork of **Dark Contact** depicting a void of blank mirrors is a reference to the imaginary place Judai inhabited once he was taken over by the darkness inside his heart and became the Supreme King.\n* **Evil Assault's** artwork depicts **Evil HERO Hell Gainer** taking a similar pose to **Neos** in the artwork of **[Assault Armor](https:\/\/yugipedia.com\/wiki\/Assault_Armor)**, another card used by Judai. The red light in the artwork is a reference to the scene from Supreme King Judai's Duel \nagaint Jim Crocodile Cook in which **Hell Gainer** returned to the field through its own effect and a bright red comet could be seen behind the Supreme King.\n* **Dark Supremacy's** artwork depicts the five **[Duelists of Death](https:\/\/yugipedia.com\/wiki\/The_Duelists_of_Death)** in the background. They were *Duel Monsters* spirits from the *GX* anime who served as the main accompaniment to the Supreme King.\n\n*****\n\n##Arcana Force\n\n* **THE HIEROPHANT** and **THE SUN** are based on their respective tarot cards from the Major Arcana.\n* **THE CHAOS RULER's** activation-preventing effect is a reference to the anime effect of **[Barrier of Light](https:\/\/yugipedia.com\/wiki\/Light_Barrier_(anime\\))**, which negated the effects of all non-**Arcana Force** monsters on the field. \n * Official summon chant: \"Destiny beckons towards the next world! The harbinger of ruin and demise! I Special Summon Arcana Force Extra - THE CHAOS RULER!!\"\n* **The Wave of Light** is the name used in the *GX* anime for the corrupting influence the **Light of Destruction** had on various people. Its artwork is a reference to a scene from Takuma Saio's Duel against Edo Phoenix in which an aura representing the Light of Destruction rose \nup from Saio's **Arcana Force XV - THE DEVIL**; in this card's case, the aura instead depicts the figure from the illustration of Saio's The Devil tarot card, which he used to foresee his own future.\n* **Arcana Spread** is named after a **tarot spread**\u2014a specific layout of tarot cards used in readings to explore questions or issues, wherein each position in the spread has a particular meaning. Its artwork is a reference to how the **Arcana Force** monsters' coin-tossing effects \nin the anime were represented by a hologram of the card itself spinning above the monster until it settled into either an upfront or reversed position.\n\n*****\n\n##Speedroid\/Clear-Wing\n\n* **Clackernel** is a portmanteau of **Clackers** (toys that were popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s made of two acrylic balls connected by a string, meant to be swung up and down so that they'd collide and make a loud clacking noise) and **colonel** (a US \narmy officer of high rank, pronounced \"kernel\").\n* The **Over** in **Crystal-Clear-Wing Over Synchro Dragon** is likely a reference to the **Limit-Over Accel Synchro** from the *5D's* anime, making this monster an *ARC-V* counterpart to Yusei Fudo's **Shooting Quasar Dragon**.\n* **Glider 2** (*Guraid\u0101 Ts\u016b*) in Japanese is a portmanteau of **glider**, **darts** (*d\u0101tsu*), and **two** (*ts\u016b*).\n* **Speedroid\/Clear-Wing** is rendered as **SR\/CWW** in the Japanese name, with the **WW** part being a reference to the **Wind Witch** theme (which was used by Rin, a character with a close relationship to Hugo, the \nDuelist from the *ARC-V* anime who used a **Speedroid**\/**Clear-Wing** Deck). The artwork takes inspiration from a scene appearing in the second *Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V* opening theme, in which Hugo performs the infamous Akira Motorcycle Slide \nwith a silhouetted **Clear-Wing Synchro Dragon** behind him. \n\n*****\n\n##Diabellstar storyline\n\n* **Wraithwitch** (*Y\u014dma*, lit. \"bewitching demon\" or \"apparition\") was also the title used for **Diabell, Wraithwitch of the White Forest** (\"Diabell, Queen of the White Forest\" in the TCG).\n* **They Alone Stand Supreme** (*Yuigadokuson*) is a Japanese four-character idiom commonly used to express self-centeredness and vainglory. It's commonly used together with another idiom, *tenj\u014dtenge* (\"throughout heaven and earth,\" used in \nthe kanji subname of **Bad-Ass Goblin Riders**) to say *tenj\u014dtenge yuigadokuson* (\"Above heaven, under heaven, I alone am worthy of honor.\")\u2014a statement which Zen Buddhists believe was made by the Buddha after his enlightenment.\n* **Aphes** is an Ancient Greek word that roughly means \"let go\" or \"let loose,\" said with an imperative inflection.\n\n*****\n\n##ARG\u2606Stars\n\n* **ARG\u2606Stars** is pronounced \"Argostars.\" The theme name is a portmanteau of **Argos** and **stars**, with **Argos** being a city in Ancient Greece. The motif is overall based on the **Nemean Games**\u2014one of the four Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece, held at Nemea \nevery two years (or every third), with the winners receiving a wreath of wild celery leaves from the city of Argos. According to legend, the games were originally instituted by the **Seven Against Thebes** (seven champions in Greek mythology who made war on Thebes) in commemoration of the \ndeath of Opheltes. The monsters being idols is likely a reference to the Nemean Games hosting musical contests among the various sporting events.\n* **Adra** is named after **Adrastus**\u2014a king of Argos and the leader of the Seven Against Thebes. Her title of **Glorious Garland** is a reference to the **Nakajima Sakae** (\"Glory\")\u2014a radial engine used in a number of combat aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy and \nImperial Japanese Army before and during World War II\u2014as well as the wreath given out as the prize at the Nemean Games.\n* **Tydel** is named after another member of the Seven: **Tydeus**\u2014an Aetolian hero in Greek mythology, belonging to the generation before the Trojan War. The moniker **Violet Lightning** (*Shiden*) is a \nreference to the **N1K2-J** ***Shiden***\u2014an Imperial Japanese Navy fighter aircraft.\n* **Capane** is based on **Capaneus** from the Seven, and her **Flying Swallow** (*Hien*) moniker is a reference to the **Kawasaki Ki-61** ***Hien*** fighter aircraft.\n* **Eteo** comes from **Eteoclus** of the Seven Against Thebes, and her **Dragonslayer** (*Tory\u016b*) moniker is a reference to the **Kawasaki Ki-45** ***Toryu***.\n\n*****\n\n##Materiactor\n\n* **Exarept** is coined from the prefix **exa-** (denoting a factor of 10^(18)) and the **rept** from **reptile**.\n* **Zeptowing** in turn comes from the prefix **zepto-** (denoting a factor of 10^(-21)).\n* **Exagard** comes from the prefix **exa-** and **J\u00f6rmungandr** (or its other name, the **Midgard Serpent**)\u2014in Norse mythology, an unfathomably large sea serpent or worm who dwells in the world sea, encircling the Earth (Midgard) and biting its own tail, similarly to an ouroboros.\n* **Supercriticality** is a term related to nuclear reactors which describes a state in which the reactor's chain reaction accelerates due to each fission event causing more than one additional fission, leading to a controlled increase in power.\n\n*****\n\n##Shark\n\n* **Jet Shark** is named after and visually resembles **Aqua Jet**, a Magic Card used by Shark in the *ZEXAL* anime.\n\n*****\n\n##Metallization\n\n* **Metal-Flame Swordman** is a reference to how **Metallization: Magic-Reflecting Armor** was first used by Bandit Keith in response to an attack from Jonouchi's **Flame Swordsman**.\n\n*****\n\n##Rough Gemstone\n\n* A **beryl** is a mineral composed of beryllium aluminum cyclosilicate, often forming beautiful, transparent crystals that can come in a variety of colors. Notable members in the beryl family include the emerald, aquamarine, morganite, etc.\n* **Resounding Cry** (*Hanky\u014d*) is a play on the Japanese word also pronounced *hanky\u014d* (\"echo\" or \"reverberation\"), with the second kanji instead having been replaced with one meaning \"cry\" or \"scream.\"\n\n*****\n\n##Sea Emperor\/Mermail\n\n* **Thundering Sea Emperor** (*G\u014dkai\u014d*) is a pun on the Japanese word also pronounced *g\u014dkai* (meaning \"heroic\" or \"largehearted\").\n* **Abysstrite** is a portmanteau of **abyss** and **Amphitrite**\u2014the Greek goddess and queen of the sea, whose consort is Poseidon.\n* **Abyssteam** is a mix of **abyss** and **team** (and possibly **steam** as well).\n\n*****\n\n##Gladial Beast\n\n* **Gister** comes from *magister militum* (lit. \"master of soldiers\")\u2014a senior military commander, essentially a general, in the Roman Empire.\n* **Claudius** is named after the fourth emperor of the Roman Empire, **Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus**. He is said to have been extraordinarily fond of games and to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to \nthe fighters.\n* **Dareios** is the Greek form of the name **Darius**, a reference to **Gladial Beast Darius**, whose name comes from **essedarius**\u2014a type of gladiator in Ancient Rome who fought from a chariot.\n* **Flavis** is a play on **Flavius**, the name used in Japanese to refer to the **Flavian Amphitheater** (the original name of the **Colosseum**).\n\n*****\n\n##Crystron\n\n* **Telistallos** (*Torisutarosu*) is a portmanteau of **lechatelierite** (*rushatorieraito*)\u2014a rare, naturally occurring form of silica glass (SiO\u2082) that forms under extremely high temperatures\u2014and *krystallos* (Ancient Greek for \"ice\" or \"rock crystal\"). One common way \nin which lechatelierite forms naturally is by very-high-temperature melting of quartz sand during a lightning strike (likely the reason for the lightning in the card's artwork). The result is an irregular, branching, often foamy hollow tube of silica glass called a **fulgurite**.\n* **Eleskeletaz** is a twist on **skeletal elestial quartz**\u2014a rare form of quartz crystal which typically has multiple layers, deep cavities, and hollow formations. This unusual growth pattern creates a multi-faceted, almost \"etched\" appearance, often \nresembling the ridges of a skeleton, which is why it's named \"skeletal.\" The term \"elestial\" refers to a type of crystal that exhibits natural etchings and layered growth.\n* **Inclusion** refers to any material, such as minerals, gas bubbles, or liquids, trapped inside a gemstone during its formation.\n* **Crystron Cluster** is named after a **crystal cluster**\u2014a group of crystals that have grown together in an open space and share a common base.\n\n*****\n\n##Heavenly Might\n\n* **Surya** is the Sun as well as the solar deity in Hinduism.\n* **Mula Adhara** is a play on **Muladhara** (lit. \"root of Existence\"), also known as the **root chakra**\u2014the first of the seven main chakras in Hindu and yogic traditions. It is symbolized by a red, four-petaled lotus, often depicted with a yellow square inside, representing the \nelement of earth.\n* **The Realm of Heavenly Might Eternal** (*Ten'imuky\u016b no Ky\u014dchi*) is a play on the Japanese four-character idiom *tenj\u014dmuky\u016b* (\"as eternal as heaven and earth\"). The Japanese term used for **Realm** (*ky\u014dchi*) can also refer to a state of being, and the second kanji it's written with \nis also the kanji used for **Land** in **The Land of Heavenly Might Everlasting** (\"Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi\" in the TCG).\n\n*****\n\n##Demonsmith\n\n* **Rex Tremendae** comes from *Rex tremendae majestatis* (Latin for \"king of tremendous majesty\" and officially translated as \"king of fearsome majesty\"), a line from the eighth verse of *Dies irae*\u2014a hymn, meaning \"Day of Wrath,\" that describes the terrifying day when \nall souls are judged by God. The line is sung as part of a plea for mercy in the face of the final judgment.\n* **Kyrie** (Greek for \"Lord\" and pronounced \"KIRI-EY\") is the common name of an important prayer of Christian liturgy, also called the *Kyrie eleison* (lit. \"Lord, have mercy\"). **Merciful Song** (*Renka*) is a pun on the Japanese term for a **love song** (also pronounced *renka*).\n\n*****\n\n##Six Samurai\n\n* **Six-Samurai Style: The Legendary True Mara's Six-Step Strike** (*Rokubushiki Shindentenma Rokudansh\u014d*) has a similar name to the older **Six-Samurai Style: Three-Step Strike** (\"Six Strike - Triple Impact\" in the TCG). The *tenma* (lit. \"heavenly demon\") in its Japanese name is another \nname used for **Mara**\u2014in Buddhism, a demonic figure representing the forces of death, desire, and delusion that prevent individuals from reaching enlightenment. Oda Nobunaga, the historical Japanese figure who **Shien** is based on, also likened himself to **Mara** in a symbolic way.\n\n*****\n\n##Miscellaneous\n\n* **Paladins of Bonds and Unity** is based on Yugi Muto's **Supreme Magical Swordsman - Black Paladin** (\"Dark Paladin\" in the TCG).\n* **Driaghoul** might be a portmanteau of **dragon**, **triangle**, and **ghoul**.\n* **Eto** likely comes from *\u00e9tranger* (French for \"stranger\" and rendered *etoranze* in Japanese), used commonly to refer to alien life forms. It has the titles **Liberator** and **Defiant** likely because **Liberator** (*Ribereit\u0101*) in Japanese starts \nwith the same syllables as **rebellion** (*riberion*).\n* **Nyarus** is a twist on *nya* (Japanese onomatopoeia for a meowing sound) and *Prionailurus* (*Purionairurusu*)\u2014a genus of spotted, small wild cats native to Asia (for example, the **leopard cat**).\n* **Hallo** and **Ween** together spell **Halloween**.\n* **Template Skipper** is named after the computing term **template**\u2014a pre-designed framework or structure used as a base for creating specific content or code. **Skipper** is also a play on **mudskipper**.\n* **Goddess of Duality** (*Hy\u014dri no Megami*, lit. \"Goddess of Front and Back\") might be a reference to the fact the original print of **Goddess of Whim** in the OCG had a mistake in its text that gave the reading *hy\u014dri* as the furigana \nfor the Japanese \"Heads or Tails\" term. The name *Hy\u014dri no Megami* also sounds similar to *sh\u014dri no megami* (\"goddess of victory\"). Its effect of sending all the player's monsters to the Graveyard and drawing a card is a reference to the original **Goddess of Whim's** effect in some \nof the early-era Game Boy video games, which allowed it to send itself from the field to the Graveyard in order to draw a card.\n* **EBI** is the Japanese word for \"shrimp,\" here specifically referring to *ebiten* (shrimp tempura), although the monster itself is depicted as *ebi fry* (Japanese-style fried shrimp). **Tempura of Fate's Mercy** (*Unpu no Tenpura*) is a mix of the \nkanji for **tempura** (a Japanese dish of fish, shellfish, or vegetables, fried in batter) and the Japanese four-character idiom *unputenpu* (\"at the mercy of fate\" or \"trusting (something) to chance\").\n* **Lightstorm Dragon** is designed as a counterpart to **[Darkstorm Dragon](https:\/\/yugipedia.com\/wiki\/Darkstorm_Dragon)**.\n* **A=Bao A Qu** is based on **A Bao A Qu**\u2014a legendary Malay creature described in Jorge Luis Borges's 1967 *Book of Imaginary Beings*. It's described as inhabiting the Tower of Victory at Chitor (now Chittorgarh) in India. According to the tale, A Bao A Qu comes to \nlife when someone climbs the spiral staircase of the tower with a pure heart and good intentions. As the person ascends, the creature gains form and becomes more vibrant, reaching its peak of perfection only if the climber achieves complete enlightenment or virtue. However, A Bao A Qu \ncan never fully complete its transformation, as few people possess the purity needed to bring it to its ultimate form.\n* **Clock-Work Knight** is a pun on **Night of the Mechanical -Clock-Work Night-** (\"Clockwork Night\" in the TCG). The monster resembles **Machine Sergeant** (\"Robotic Knight\" in the TCG), the Deck Master of Soichiro Ota in the *Duel Monsters* anime, a Duelist who played **Clock-Work Night** \nas part of his Deck.\n* **He Arkhe** (pronounced \"HEY AR-KAY\") is slightly broken Ancient Greek for \"the beginning\" or \"the origin,\" while *Hydor* is the Ancient Greek word for \"water.\" This is a reference to the Ancient Greek philosopher Thales, who held the theory that the **arche** or \noriginating principle of nature was a single material substance: water.\n* **Double Wild** is a reference to a **wild card** in card games\u2014one that may be used to represent any other playing card.\n* The **Delta** in **Delta of Temptation** is a double entendre on the Greek letter **delta** and the geographical term for a triangular landform that forms at the mouth of a river, where it flows into an ocean, sea, lake, or another body of water.\n\n*****\n\n#Tournament Pack 2024 Vol.4\n\n1. **[Space Omajinai Usagi](https:\/\/img.yuyu-tei.jp\/card_image\/ygo\/front\/prd\/11036.jpg)** \n2.

It's available in the app so it's on Zepto to deliver the products and show them as a single order. \n\nIf it's Swiggy\/Zomato then it's understandable that I want to order from different places and thus I'll pay the extra delivery fee.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","103":"Created an app in which you can compare prices between multiple platforms like instamart, blinkit etc.  \n\nHi guys, I created an app [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) where you can compare prices of multiple products available on platforms like Instamart, Blinkit, Bigbasket Zepto.

In 2024, India became the 4th biggest tech hub in the world. While global markets have grappled with tighter financial conditions, India has weathered the storm, drawing on its innovative spirit and rapidly growing digital economy. Even though venture capital and private equity money dropped a bit \u2014 $7.6 billion in 2024 compared to $8.2 billion in 2023 \u2014 India still proves that it\u2019s a top spot for new ideas.\n\nThis article looks at how India\u2019s tech industry is going strong even when times are tough. It\u2019s getting a boost from growing areas like fintech, retail tech, and cleantech. Cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Gurugram still lead the way as crucibles of new ideas. We\u2019ll take a close look at Tracxn\u2019s 2024 India Tech Geo YTD Report and hear from industry experts, and learn about the trends, hurdles, and new chances that will shape the future of India\u2019s tech world.\n\n# India\u2019s tech world stays strong in 2024: Growing economy sparks new ideas\n\nAt the core of India\u2019s start-up success lies its strong economy, which will grow by 8.2 per cent in 2024, surpassing global growth rates. This economic strength has built a firm base for the country\u2019s growing tech scene, helping its start-ups to handle the financial troubles that have struck other big markets. India\u2019s dynamic business world, backed by its young and tech-smart people, has enabled it to deal with the global funding slowdown better than many other nations.\n\n# Investment trends and how decreased funding affects things\n\nEven though India\u2019s startup scene is still going strong, it took a hit with a 7 per cent drop in total funding \u2014 going from $8.2B in 2023 to $7.6B in 2024. This dip has led to a big change in where investors are putting their money. They\u2019re playing it safe now, giving $4.7 billion to more established companies. Meanwhile newer start-ups are feeling the pinch, with their funding taking a nosedive to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe global funding slowdown, which has an impact on geopolitical tensions and a tightening capital market, has pushed investors to focus on mature startups which have shown that they can scale. Pankaj Sharma CEO of Religare Finvest Ltd, contends, \u201cInvestors are drawn to companies that show openness, can adapt, and bounce back. This matters a lot in a shaky market where handling risks is key to growing in the long run.\u201d\n\n# Sectoral performance: Top performers and strugglers in 2024\n\n# Retail tech: Causing a revolution in customer experiences\n\nRetail tech stands out as one of India\u2019s top performers in 2024, pulling in $1.95 billion in funding \u2014 a 23 per cent jump from 2023. Flipkart and Meesho still lead the e-commerce scene, pushing growth through shopping experiences that use tech and cater to each person. Also, the boom in quick commerce has boosted companies like Zepto, which grabbed $665 million in funding this year. Zepto\u2019s super-fast grocery delivery shows how shoppers\u2019 wants to have changed, with speed and ease now being the key factors.\n\nRaja Singh Bhurji, CEO of The StepUp Ventures observes, \u201cBengaluru\u2019s mix of cultures, along with its global mindset, have helped start-ups to grow. The city\u2019s focus on learning and its pool of top talent allows start-ups to come up with new ideas and get more funding.\u201d Bengaluru\u2019s leading position in grabbing 35 per cent of the total funding in 2024, shows how much the city drives India\u2019s retail tech growth.\n\n# Fintech: Balancing new ideas and rules\n\nFintech has emerged as a key part of India\u2019s tech scene, attracting $1.49 billion in investments. The industry has seen quick digital uptake, pushed by offerings like digital fixed deposits (FDs), giving people new options to handle their money. Ravi Jain from Blostem thinks that the field\u2019s wins come from striking a balance between following rules and pushing tech forward. \u201cWe talk to regulators which lets us lead in new ideas while making sure that our products meet the criteria of the changing rules,\u201d he says.\n\n# Cleantech: The future of sustainability and electric mobility\n\nIndia\u2019s goal to reach Net-Zero emissions by 2070 has made cleantech a fast-growing industry, but it still faces big challenges. Pritesh Talwar, President of Lectrix EV, asserts, \u201cThe cleantech industry is still new in India, and scaling solutions like electric vehicles comes with issues such as high initial costs and worries about running out of power. However, these problems also create chances to come up with new ideas.\u201d Lectrix EV\u2019s Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) model is one such new idea, which has cut the cost of owning an electric two-wheeler (E2W) a lot by offering flexible leasing and swapping options.\n\nLectrix EV aims to create a lasting ecosystem, not just electric vehicles. They\u2019ve set up 250 battery swap stations in Delhi and want to add 400 more throughout India. This network has strategic placements to lessen range anxiety, which stops many people from buying EVs.\n\n# Aerospace and defence: Public-private partnerships and emerging technologies\n\nIndia\u2019s aerospace & defence sector is changing. Public-private partnerships and a focus on self-reliance are driving this change. The Make in India programme has pushed for more domestic production. Simultaneously, AI and robotics advances are reshaping our defence capabilities. Kiran Rudrappa, CEO of Posspole, says: \u201cThe government\u2019s Strategic Partnership model and public-private collaborations are critical for driving innovation in the aerospace sector. AI and robotics are key to enhancing India\u2019s defence efficiency.\u201d Yet, the sector still faces money problems. Companies are now looking to use government plans like iDEX to back new ideas.\n\nRead the full article:\u00a0[https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/](https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/)","105":"Zepto Scam - Legal Advice New Delhi.\nI ordered items worth 3500 on zepto.

I left India in my 20s lived in eu for few years & settled in US for 2 deacdes , but still travel globally every week including visits to India every month , so I observe & compare these markets very closely.\n\nIndia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017. The digital currency, ondc & several transformational initiatives. Stock Market is riding high on the modi wave , so is Inflation , purchasing power & rupee valuations (may be on purpose ) has gone down  drastically. Cost of a good meal is same or higher in India compared to US\/EU , but income isn't comparable.\n\nI keep seeing lots of startups coming up , but none are able to succeed on a global platform , several are acquired by west backed competition ,  most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west. \n\nExcept a lenskart , zoho , bookmyshow & a few more handful, none of them have succeeded in global arena. Why is that? If the product was good ,it should have , right ?  I understand some business need not go global , but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nUbers, amazons were  able to Penetrate indian markets & eat local share , but a ola or flipkart hasn't gone global .\nZomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses , Oyo has acquired lot of properties , but they just loss making properties & are still in losses.  \n\nWith the largest pie of IT engineers in the world , we haven't had a single app\/product that's globally used, we have only been a consumer market. With 12 % of world population & biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\nI remember using flipkart in the beginning once & the website design & layout itself were a mimic of Amazon forget the business model , I had doubts if they will succeed , but ended up being sold for billions. \n\nMama earth is a rip off of Babyganics including its branding &  green colors, but it's valued at 5000 cr .\n\nWe keep seeing lots of half baked products on Indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr+ . \n\nThere was a lot of VC funding coming , so valuation game was On , but lately foreign VC funding  has dried up , as most investments are yielding profits & exits are just based in hype based valuations.\n\nZepto is a great example , how a company with no unique IP is valued so much & already people are claiming its model is a failure &  not scalable. Those 2 young kids don't have the same charm or intellect that we saw in Gates or jobs when they were young. Lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nThe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success , whereas in India we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nBut how long will this circus last ? Only till VC funds dry up or when NRI\/rich Indians stop pumping into this game ?\n\n I am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent , we are capable , but the new set of Heros that are projected aren't worth it & my concern is that they don't oversell & fail ,  making it worse for future entrepreneurs","107":"Paradyes cherry coke This is the cheapest price I am getting it for 488 on zepto plus 75 cash in wallet.

Talking of the texture, these gums are harder to chew when compared with Orbit or happydent. It does serve as a jaw exercise. The flavour is good. However, it is only short-lived. It doesn't last long. 5 minutes of chewing the gum is all it takes for the flavour to disappear. The aftertaste for the next 5-7 minutes was of stevia. Post that, it's a tasteless gum. The gum also starts to break apart and stick on the teeth. In isolation, it is a subpar product. For the price, assuming someone eats 3 gums a day(1 after every meal), the total cost of eating these chewing gums for a month is Rs. 594(3 gums a day \u00d7 30 days = 90 gums; 1 pack has 15 gums; 6 such packs would be needed for 1 month). It's not worth the cost. One needs a good mouth freshener and sugarfree gums like happydent cost only Rs. 20 per pack(paper pack). It is more of a luxury item than a functional one. ","113":"The Transforming Startup Landscape in India and Future Potential The popularity of startups is growing among Gen-Z, making them the most sought-after career option in present times. However, the initial wave of startups dates back to the Great Recession, which first diverted the earning population towards entrepreneurship. Logistics and advertising startups were prominent in the past, however, 56 diverse industrial sectors are contributing to the growth of startups in the Indian subcontinent. IT services majorly contribute to the trend with a market share of 13.0%, followed by healthcare and life sciences (9.0%), and education (7.0%).\u00a0\n\nIn 2016-23, the IT industry accounted for more than 13,500 startups in India, demonstrating a remarkable CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 289.0%. 49.0% of the IT startups, recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), belonged to tier 2\/ 3 cities. The IT startups have generated more than 1.52 lakh (152 thousand) jobs. The sectors with the highest recognized startups in the IT Industry include application development (25.0%), product development (24.0%), and IT consulting.\n\nThe healthcare & lifesciences industry grew by a CAGR of 127.0%, with the numbers reaching over 11,000, during the period. 47.0% of the recognized startups belonged to tier 2\/3 cities. The startups provided a living to more than 1.11 lakh (111 thousand) people. The highest-performing industrial sectors include health & wellness (27.0%), healthcare services (19.0%), and pharmaceutical (16.0%).\n\nThe third most significant donor to the overall growth of Indian startups is the education industry, with more than 7,100 recognized startups, with 52.0% of the total belonging to tier 2\/3 cities. The industry is growing at a CAGR of 77.0%, employing more than 69,000 people. The top-performing sectors include education technology (34.0%), skill development (27.0%), and e-learning (22.0%).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, DPIIT has determined the \u2018Changemaker Industries' be the 'Indian Startup Ecosystem'. The changemaker industries are characterized as the industries that are growing with the fastest CAGR of recognized startups in the country. Waste management is one such industry, which grew 41x in number of startups during 2020-23. The absolute values include 900+ recognized startups, of which 58.0% of startups were recognized from Tier 2\/3 cities. This generated employment for more than 9,500 individuals.\u00a0\n\nToys and Games is another changemaker industry, marking an 84x increase in the number of startups during 2020-22. It reported over 330 recognized startups, generating more than 3,400 employees. 41.0% of the total startups were recognized from tier 2\/3 cities.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIndian Government has contributed significantly to the growth of the entrepreneurial mindset, which is evident in the launch of the \u2018Startup India\u2019 initiative in 2016. Since its launch the \u2018Startup India\u2019 created over 15.53 lakh (1.5 million) direct jobs. Additionally, DPIIT recognized 1,40,803 entities as startups, as of June 2024. The consistent efforts of the forum have made India the third largest ecosystem for startups, after the US and China. In March 2024, at Startup Mahakumbh PM Narendra Modi, announced the existence of 1.25 lakh (125 thousand) startups and 110 unicorns, in the country highlighting the economic potential.\u00a0\n\nStartup India is a comprehensive initiative that supports the growth and development of the startup ecosystem. It has provided regulatory support for the organization of the landscape, by ascertaining the development of optimal frameworks. Some of the recent developments in the arena include Finance Bill 2022, Single Master Form (SMF), One Person Companies (OPCs), and more. The government is providing an incubator framework to provide the necessary resources such as infrastructure, mentorship, and financial support to nurture innovation in startups. India has more than 400 incubators, however, most of them are in the nascent stage. The SISFS (Startup India Seed Fund Scheme), is expected to benefit approximately 3600 startups, with a corpus of INR 945 crore ($127.5 million), divided over 4 years, starting FY 2021-22, for eligible incubators.\n\nStartup India also provides various networking facilities for startups such as international engagement, and other programs and challenges. In addition, the support extends in the form of recognition, marquee initiatives, and other resources.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe years from 2015-2022 have witnessed exponential growth in the Indian startup ecosystem, with a 15X increase in the total funding of startups, a 9X increase in the number of investors, and a 7X increase in the number of incubators.\n\nThe trend is contributing to the rapid emergence of Indian Unicorns, contributing significantly to the economy and the job landscape in the region. Unicorns have been increasing exponentially in India, for the past four years, since FY 2017-18, marking a significant 66.0% Year-on-Year growth in the number of additional unicorns being added every year. In October 2023, India reported 111 unicorns with a total valuation of $349.67 billion. Of these 45 unicorns with a total valuation of $ 102.3 billion were born in 2021 and 22, unicorns with a total valuation of $29.20 billion were born in 2022. Unconventional sectors and sub-sectors entered the unicorn space including, NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Company), conversational messaging, cryptocurrency exchanges, D2C (Direct-to-Consumer), cloud kitchens, and more. At present, 1 out of 10 unicorns globally are born in India.\u00a0\n\nIndia is considered the \u2018Most Friendly Startup Country\u2019, according to the 2021 survey of CEO World Magazine. This is primarily attributed to, the availability of a technical workforce, increased investment in upskilling the workforce, escalating focus on R&D, adequate availability of resources, and favorable policy framework. Additionally, increasing digitalization, and progressive government initiatives such as, 'Make in India' and 'Atmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 are also contributing to the development of the startup ecosystem in the country.\u00a0\n\nThe growth of the startup ecosystem is primarily driven by increasing corporate connections and accelerating government support. Enterprises are realizing the potential of start-ups and are partnering with\/investing in them. For instance, Facebook in partnership with Startup India disbursed cash grants of $50,000 each to 5 startups.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, women entrepreneurs have a significant contribution to the startup ecosystem, with 50.0% of Indian startups led by women. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), 45.0% of the startups are run by women, of which over 50,000 startups are recognized by the government. Some of the prominent women-led Indian startups include Nykaa, Mobikwik, Zolo, Byjus, Thrillophilia, and more. Women-led start-ups generate more returns than those led by men, with up to 35.0% higher ROI (Return On Investment).\u00a0\n\nWomen are driven towards the start-up culture, in a vague to provide a lifestyle to their family. As women make 85.0% of purchase decisions, they are looking forward to contributing to the expenses. Furthermore, Indian women are pivotal benefactors to the science and technology sector, owing to the steady rise in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduates that account for 40.0%.\u00a0\n\nThe Indian government is encouraging women entrepreneurs by introducing various initiatives and schemes. The Ministry of Women and Child Development saw a marginal increase of 2.5% in the budget allocation for the financial year 2024-25. The total budget for the ministry stands at INR 26592.19 crore ($3.2 billion), as against INR 25948.68 ($3.1 billion) in FY 2023-24. This has also been supported by the schemes of the central government, such as Bharatiya Mahila Bank Business Loan, Dena Shakti Scheme, Udyogini Scheme, Women Entrepreneurship Platform, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, coupled with the different schemes offered by the state government.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIndia currently has over 15.7 million women-owned enterprises, which is expected to reach 30 million by 2030, accounting for the creation of 150\u2013170 million jobs in the region. This is anticipated to bestow fortune on the national economy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nContrary to the past circumstances the ongoing economic turbulence has resulted in a decline in the funding rendered to the startups. This resulted in the drop off of 25 startups from the unicorn list, with only 3 managing to make up for the enlistment. The three unicorns included Zepto, an expedited delivery service, InCred Finance, and Porter, a logistics platform. Ixigo shorted the index following its successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) earlier this year. A steep rise in the interest rates has also contributed to the overall decline. However, India reported 67 unicorns, 46 Gazelles, and 106 Cheetahs, collectively valued at $58.0 billion, increasing by 1.8% from the previous year.\u00a0\n\nIndia\u2019s tech landscape has faced the highest decline owing to the downturn. In 2023, the funding for tech startups plunged 67.0% YoY, to $ 6.0 billion. The decline was huge after the funding peaks of $ 24.1 billion (2021), and $ 18.2 billion (2022). In 2023, the number of new tech unicorns fell to two. However, the decline in funding promoted the prioritization of business fundamentals among tech startups, which would be beneficial in the long run.\u00a0\n\nThe funding is uncertain for the Indian economy. For instance, the startup funding again dwindled below the expectation for the week of 19th August 2024-24th August 2024, during the launch of four startup-focused funds, including Titan Capital (Winners Fund), Volt VC, Arka Credit Fund, and PW School of Startups.\u00a0\n\nEncapsulating, current circumstances hold the Indian startup ecosystem in the grave of precariousness. However, the nation is bound to bounce back owing to government support, aspiring investors, and the rising entrepreneurial spirit among the people. Thus, the region highlights a bright morning for the startup ecosystem in the wake of nurturing political and legal frameworks, active involvement by women, and supportive investor sentiments. Additionally, the rise of potential startups is anticipated a bring a dawn of multifold progress to the Indian economy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Find out more on our page at:**[**https:\/\/www.omrglobal.com\/articles\/the-transforming-startup-landscape**](https:\/\/www.omrglobal.com\/articles\/the-transforming-startup-landscape)","114":"Anyone here selling on blinkit\/bigbasket\/zepto We want to sell some farm products on such platform, I checked on their website but did not get proper way to start selling on their platforms. Is anyone from this sub selling on such platforms, can you help me to get started.","115":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 19th, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n\n\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) on the r\/ecommerce subreddit for a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business.

Does it even allowed  Hyderabad-based Suhas Shetty narrated his predicament to Startup Pedia over a phone call. Here's the condensed version:\n\n\"My name is Suhas Shetty, and I'm the founder of Iceberg Organic Ice Creams, India's first and only organic ice cream brand. We've been around for 6 years and have 50+ franchise stores in South India. Recently, we ventured into North India with a dark kitchen model, allowing customers to order through Swiggy, Zomato, and our website.\n\nIn 2023, we participated in Shark Tank India Season 3 auditions\u2026we were thrilled to be selected for the final audition in Bangalore and filmed our pitch on September 23rd. The producers even suggested a \"Bahubali\" theme for our pitch to boost viewership, and we agreed.\n\nHere's where things went south.\n\nConfirmation for our episode airing arrived in January's 2nd week, just days before the season premiere.\n\nWe received confirmation that our episode would air on March 29th, the season finale. However, on the 28th, they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation.\n\nThis news was devastating. Based on the confirmation email, we had shipped nearly Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country, perishable products with a shelf life of just 3-4 months.\n\nSince then, I've relentlessly tried contacting the Shark Tank team. They didn't respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month. We've even secured a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Bahubali film producer Shobu Yarlagadda, addressing any theme-related concerns.\n\nMy requests are simple: Air the pitch or feature it in the \"unseen pitches\" segment on YouTube, as done in previous seasons. Out of 150 pitchers, I'm the only one fateful.\n\nFrustrated, we're desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto. But for a small brand, moving Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge.\n\nWe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency. The same is expected from a platform like Shark Tank India. All I seek is a resolution \u2013 air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts.\"","130":"Despite fund raising Zepto want to lose customers!

The food in (not just the mess) but most of the restaurants I have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine. Even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam.

I tried Zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact DMart in the long run. Here are my two cents:\n\n1. **Experience with Zepto**: It was really good and fast, and cheaper due to coupons, but not when compared to DMart's prices.\n\n2. **Will I buy from Zepto again?**  \n   Sure, I will. Who doesn\u2019t want a few quick deals in the name of a discount?\n\n3. **Will I continue investing in DMart or invest more?**  \n   Yes, I will. Until quick commerce burns VC capital, I\u2019ll stay invested. Once the business model is proven to fail, DMart will likely boom.\n\n**How long can VCs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption?**  \nOnly until the IPO, or six months after the IPO due to the lock-in period.\n\n\n**Updates:**\n\nMost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend Blinkit:\n\n**Usability of the application:**\n\n\n**1. Once people become accustomed to an app, they are unlikely to switch, even in the absence of discounts.**\n\nIn my view, this isn\u2019t entirely true, at least in India.\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Recent news highlighted how Jio and Airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes.\n\n\u2022 How many of us stick to just one quick commerce app? Isn\u2019t it common to compare prices between Swiggy and Zomato before ordering food?\n\n\n**2. The elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price:**\n\nAgain, I\u2019m unsure how long this will hold true. The same elite crowd often shops at stores like Zudio and Westside for the in-store experience, rather than relying on online platforms like Myntra or Amazon.\n\n1. Personally, I used to buy meat from an online app for several years. However, after receiving stale meat once, I switched to buying meat directly from shops. These shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options.\n\n\nOne alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of over 315 for Zomato\u2014a tech company with a profit of just \u20b9250+ crores\u2014while being hesitant to invest in DMart, which has a profit exceeding \u20b9650+ crores and a much lower P\/E of 87.\n\nIn my opinion, the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor. However, how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer. Until then, I believe both quick commerce and brick-and-mortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar.

And the language barrier there. \n\nDon\u2019t remember the expost but people were arguing about which place is better than other\n\nWell I shifted from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar on 1st July after staying there for 3 years.\n\nHere are some observations:\n\nPros of Living in Bangalore:\n1. Fast paced life. People work hard and you do the same.\n2. You see successful people there and that helps you work harder too.\n3. You get a better pay over there.\n4. The weather is \u2764\ufe0f\n5. The language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\nCons of living in Bangalore:\n1. The city kind of lost its heart. You don\u2019t get too many people ready to help. You hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers.\n2. Too many ways to lose money. Whether its the Convenience of zepto, blinkit or the expensive goods over there, you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3. The quality of water and food is not as great.\n4. Traffic is \u274c\n5. Some spots where you see the language problems, it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nBut Bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\nPros:\n1. The heart. I never lived in Bhubaneswar. My hometown is in Keonjhar. The can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber, an electrician and a carpenter for the house. For no reason at all.\n2. The price of basic commodities. In Bangalore, my per day expenses would be \u20b91500 for the family. This includes food groceries, petrol etc. Here I spend less than \u20b9500 for me and my wife. Things are way cheaper here.\n3. Closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before.\n4. Everyone knows odia. Its so much easier to communicate \n5. The food. People here have no idea how rare authentic Odia food is in other states.\n\nCons:\n1. Every service provider (carpenter, plumber etc) delays their project for no reason. The AC installation guys came late. (12pm ish after promising 9 am) took a break in middle.. went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2. The weather is so much more humid. Its hotter here. Irritating between 10 am to 4 pm. I just have to adjust to this.\n3. Not a lot of dog friendly areas. Its rare here. \n\n\nThat\u2019s about it.\n\nI tried to be as objective as possible.\n\nThe reason I moved here was because I was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t regret one bit.\n\nLike I said.\n\nThe heart of our people is something I love.","144":"Need suggestions from the gym peeps here...

It doesn't smudge when lightly rubbed or when water falls on it but peels off\/disintegrates when exposed to water **and** rubbed. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this if you're going to be sweating a lot or actively getting wet in the rain. **Long wearing**. I wore it at around 6:30 am before going to work and it lasted till at least 2:30pm or so before it started showing slight signs of wear in the inner corner which tends to happen even with a lot of more expensive eyeliners. Layers really well so if you want or need to touch up, you can do that in a few seconds, no problem. Great for **everyday use** (or if you only wear eyeliner once in a while) if you don't normally have any issues with eyeliner smudging or transferring, oily lids, etc. The quality is really good too. It didn't irritate my eyes or anything. If you have sensitive\/reactive eyes, obviously be careful. It is worth noting that Insight is one of the cheaper brands that actually mentions all its safety and non-toxicity certifications on its website which is reassuring. Will definitely repurchase and will update if my experience changes as I've only used it a few times till now. \n\n[Writing on the packaging has already worn off..lol! ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/izt8xea2cdgd1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6fb4ea1519c26b42ac62c3f64c324d2cad9e8e4)\n\n[Dries matte](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c2vd8lk6cdgd1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a0b1abf8dad9cdaabdde647cbe6bb4ac03a548)\n\n[\\(After 7-8 hours\\) Slight wear in the inner corner but mostly intact and the colour remains intense.

Also, just like curling hair, with eyelashes too there is a danger of breakage, damage, etc. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. \n\nI've been passionate about curling my eyelashes for years now as the difference it makes to my long but zero-curl eyelashes (they actually grow downwards) is immense. I've had my Shu Uemura lash curler which fits my eye shape perfectly for more than 15 years and it still works perfectly. When I curl my lashes during the day or in the evening, it's all good. The problem is when I'm rushing to work in the morning and have to wash my face or shower and do my makeup immediately thereafter. I realised that my eyelashes are not completely dry when I am curling them and that affected the result..less to almost no curl. No amount of dabbing with a towel makes a difference. The only thing that does give me the result I seek is heating up my lash curler. Somehow the heat dries up the residual moisture and the curl is much more pronounced. I thought of using my blow dryer (well-known tip, nothing new) but plugging it up, heating up the curler and then wrapping the cord nicely and storing it back in its rightful place is just too time consuming when you have exactly 15 minutes max to get ready. Recently, I came across the K-beauty tip of heating up a wooden stick with a lighter and using that to curl (or re-curl) your lashes after mascara. I tried this but part of the stick I used (user error, not the best kind of stick) started to singe, break off and almost fell into my eyes (yikes!). I noped right out of that idea. Earlier, I'd also come across a video of someone who used a lighter to heat up their lash curler directly with fire! At first, I didn't want to try this as the idea of heated metal possibly burning my eyelid was terrifying even to me (I've done a lot of stupid experiments in the name of beauty and curiosity in my \"youth\"). Finally, though, I gave in and ordered a 35\/- lighter from Zepto and cautiously heated up my lash curler (only the top half as shown in the pic). Surprisingly, if you use the low setting of the lighter and do a few quick swipes across the length (don't hold the flame in one place too long) it doesn't even get that hot. The one time it did, I just put my hands on the metal and the heat transferred to my hands and cooled it down enough for safe use. I would even say that while using a lighter you have even more control on how much you're heating it up as opposed to a blow dryer where you might end up heating the whole thing and burning yourself. Complete game changer. Lashes on fleek all day, every day. \n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yuv1s6sjgdgd1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e8fcac16748ea5f62224d21b0ce147ee2cf1951\n\n","154":"Explain like I'm 5: Things to take care of when cooking chicken Hello ladies, enbies, and other gender queer folks! I'm planning to incorporate chicken into my diet, mainly to up my protein intake but I've never handled it in the kitchen before. I've eaten it in restaurants though. So mainly my confusion revolves around the following aspects:\n\n1. Which place is better to buy chicken: local butcher or apps like zepto, blinkit, liscious etc. on the basis of quality, price, and any other metrics that may be necessary?\n\n\n2. I would prefer to buy from a local butcher because I'm trying to curb reliance over apps, supporting local yada yada. In this case, what do I say to the butcher? I don't want to sound completely clueless. What cut, size, weight etc to ask for? How to ensure safety and quality standards are being met? And how to know if I'm being fooled or ripped off?\n\n\n3. I mostly plan to buy a bulk quantity that can be safely preserved in the freezer and can be thawed and cooked as needed over 4-5 days. Is this even feasible? What quantity can I buy and freeze for the maximum possible duration such that it doesn't go bad?\n\n\n4. How to tell if the chicken is undercooked? Is the pinkishness the only way? Any tips and tricks to not undercook or overcook the chicken or is it only learnt by experience? \n\n\n5. What are the easiest and quickest ways to cook chicken? I don't think a curry would be possible on week days because of a hectic schedule. I'm mainly thinking chicken soup or small peices on tawa. Would I have to buy an air fryer for this? \n\n\n6. Are there any other important things that I'm missing that I need to take care of when working with chicken? \n\n\nApologies for the laundry list of questions, I have tried googling, searching YouTube but I didn't find a definitive answer especially on the buying part. All help will be appreciated.

hotwheels car smells kinda metallic and rusty 0 performance its my favourite as it looks very cool\n\n2 pendora scents noir en leather clone of tom fords ombre leather got it yesterday for 1k from a friend who didnt like it and used it only twice it might be a bit too early to call this my favourite i know but it smells so damn good to me \nopening kind of spicy with the main note of cardamomelaichi this doesnt last very long though\ndry down rich and syntheticbut in the best way possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance very pleasant not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather\n\n5 jaguar classic black\nmy daily go to got it for 24k on blinkitzeptoi dont remembervery generic and mass pleasing cant really put my hand on what notes it uses but its fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge great summer frag but can be used all year round moderate performance the bottle is so dishevelled because i keep it in my bag for school everyday\n\n6 ajmal

thing in india theyre trying to solve a problem that never really existed\nswish zepto cafe swiggy bolt etc promising fresh food in 10 mins when we know its either shit or just frozen foodfast food reheated or whatever there have been so many complaints and people saying that they felt uneasy and sick after having swish food\nall theyre riding on is gimmicky investor money burning cash and running fake pr on linkedin and otherwise\nrecently came across some tweet alleging zepto  cafe using all kinds of dirty tricks and undercuts to fulfill their orders\n\nmy question is why\nif you really have only 10 mins to get food step down and get somethingwhich most people do btw i feel all these startups are so gimmicky 10 min delivery was already something which required so much exploitation but ill not get into that fresh food in 10 min seems like a joke which no one wants to hear btw every person who i have talked to has only scoffed at the idea calling it unnecessary\n\nmy question is we live in a world full of real issues why are we supporting shitty ideas like swish and zepto cafe just because they cater to like 01 of the people why not put it in places where it actually contributes to society\n\nwe all know that these people running promotions initially will show numbers and revenue but theres no way they can sustain plus the exploitation of labour is unmatched there is no justification to that and most importantly no need for it\n\nmight be wrong would like to hear more opinions my question is we live in a world full of real issues why are we supporting shitty ideas like swish and zepto cafe just because they cater to like 01 of the people why not put it in places where it actually contributes to society\n\ni dont want to be rude but your statement comes across as a bit naive and coming from idealism instead of realism we live in capitalistic society 10 min delivery apps exist because of the same reason amazon exists\n\nhumans want things these apps remove friction stepping down from your apartment requires effort walking or driving to get food or other things requires effort\nwhat labor exploitation these delivery guys are making 810x the money they were making previously \n\npeople have moved real far from their homes because the earning opportunity and demand is so high\n\nstep down and get some food  have you ever been to india dude i would step down and fall into an open manhole and never be able to get food \n\nclearly you have no clue what youre talking about nor know how much real demand there is for such an app in india and other developing countries\nthat business model isnt sustainable it basically pressures riders which arent even employed theyre on commission to take unnecessary risks that puts them and other people in danger\n\nweve had some startups in spain with a similar idea groceries in under 10 minutes but they are mostly gone now\nbecause investors enable bs startups like that these investors are looking to launder their illgotten gains and what better vessel than to dump money into copypaste churnandburn startups led by tech grifters not sure why we dont talk about how vc is a massive massive money laundering machine for the moneyed and it gets especially worse in new money regions like india india btw is the definition of new money\n\nsource i will never invest with indian vcs again and i am talking well known name brand individuals\ni am not sure how they are managing to cook the food and deliver it in under 10 minutes maybe they have limited inventory i dont know what i do know is the delivery person will break 10 traffic rules just to be on time plus injuries to himself or anyone on the road plus there is this other thing where people are ready to risk themselves for money you cannot claim that zomato or swiggy is liable for any damage either overall its a win win for these companies and they are just pushing the envelope and one day it will all break","3":"why are 10 min fresh food delivery apps becoming a thing theyre trying to solve a problem that never really existed\nswish zepto cafe swiggy bolt etc promising fresh food in 10 mins when

from vcs\n\nvcs themselves mostly fund money because they want to exit off the next raise so they want to put in money into the hottest thing that they find\nbecause bigger temporary revenues bigger stock prices investor money  ipo ultimately its a game to unload these unrealistic valuations on the retail investors nothing else the owners and pe vc firms get to cash out\njust like amazon and walmart make money off of their own labels\n\nzomato will make more money selling coffee from their own cafe cloud kitchen vs delivering coffee from starbucks\n\nwith blinkit zomato went after kirana stores with these 10 mins food delivery theyre going after the unknown small dhabas  restaurants  home kitchen\nexactly my point they are just playing passing the parcel \ud83d\udce6 game to increase the valuation and grt a good exit\nmost of the food that gets sold follows a pareto principle with key food items being biryanipizza and a few other hero products that get sold the most 10 minutes of food delivery doesnt have to mean 2 minutes of preparation for highvolume goods their demand can be predicted and thereby a fast predictive supply chain can be built to service this demand for lowvolume skus these brands can quote higher service durationtimelines \n\nas far as it being sustainable etc is a question that these firms need to answer if enough people keep ordering and the retention is sustained this can be solved not sure why people are being so paranoid the same happened with grocery delivery as well if grocery is a 10 min thing then readymade food absolutely makes sense quality needs to be figured out and i guess it will eventually be","4":"my novice collection  1 zara silver edt a fresh clean scent with citrusy top notes and a woody base perfect for everyday

one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso you cannot do much in this case what the card classifies for the rewards its upto them try with customers care call and email and tell them you will complain to rbi ombudsman let us know it if works \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nwhat was the merchant name you see on the payment page","9":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25 week of dec 16th 2024 hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past 3 years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top

vertical or square aspect ratios they can also bring their own assets to extend remix and blend or create entirely new content from text\n\nshopify made shop campaigns available to all of merchants in the us and canada an advertising tool that was previously only available to shopify plus merchants shopify describes them as riskfree campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with shop merchants only pay for conversions when new or existing customers convert while shopify takes care of optimizing the creative audience and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets to clarify one thing  shop campaigns arent driving traffic to the merchants store but rather to their products and storefront within the shop app however once the customer makes a purchase through shop app they become part of the merchants customer database and email  sms list if they optin\u00a0\n\nwix introduced a new genai tool called ai sitechat that is designed to serve as a

hindi word that means fast or quick amazon already operates amazon fresh in the country which offers a twohour delivery service and the 15minute service could help the company attract more grocery and

rob bonta claiming that the shift would have seismic implications for silicon valley while also saying that musk and former openai board member shivon zilis are qualified to represent the interests of californians in the matter meta wrote if openais new business model is valid nonprofit investors would get the same forprofit upside as those who invest the conventional way in forprofit companies while also benefiting from tax writeoffs bestowed by the government\n\namazon\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers according to a senate investigation led by bernie sanders the\u00a0160page report\u00a0digs into the companys abysmal safety record and claims that amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its

earths warnings about the gloom were not unfounded spacecraft that travel into the cloud risk certain death gloom spores adversely affect computers and electronic devices at  damage to electronics and data banks increases with spore concentration navigational systems will scramble under gloom interference do not listen to the gloom spore cloud causes hull damage through friction and has a mild corrosive property the gloom is not simply a collection of spores it is a thing that acts with purpose as evident from its desire to consume my super destroyer it sustains and commands terminids within the cloud with uncanny coordination a termicide gas cover can give a spaceship time enough to escape its grasp but theres no guarantee it wont adapt how did humanity engineer such an unstoppable force\n\nwe have scraped the ses song of the people for gloom spore samples that will be sent to  research center along with this report\n\nalthough the expedition ended in disaster i hope what can be gleaned from this will be of some use to our cause and help find some answers\n\noriginal art by me\n\nvera libertas this is amazing\nperhaps i could study some of these samples to see what the gloom exactly is and how we can better understand what is going on\nexpedition team\n\nthis is a critical update from the research base on rouge v weve begun analyzing the samples youve sent back and our findings have raised significant concerns\n\nrecent intelligence reports indicate that something other than terminids is present in your area the terminids themselves are displaying unprecedented behavior becoming increasingly erratic and hostileeven to each other they appear to be attacking and consuming one another to grow larger a behavior we have never observed before\n\nthis anomaly suggests the presence of an unknown factor within the containment zone signatures from the area imply that you may have unexpected companyentities that are not terminids\n\nremain vigilant and exercise extreme caution if your expedition detects any unusual activity or encounters any nonterminid entities report back immediately your safety and the integrity of the mission are our top priorities\n\nstay sharp out there\n\ndr kane\n\nend transmission\nliterally the only thing super earth didnt lie about\nvery nice work excellent interference redactions","16":"zepto mostly delivers rotten food  anyone else facing this so i recently ordered some groceries from zepto because they have free delivery charges but what i received was anything but fresh several items were either rotten or close to it i tried contacting their customer support hoping for an easy refund i was ready for replacement as well but it seems like i have to beg just to get what i paid for\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences with zepto or other quick commerce platforms its frustrating that they promise quality and speed but if theres a problem theyre conveniently unavailable or dismissive why are these platforms allowed to operate this way it feels like theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service india has such a large population that hitting the ceiling on consumer signup takes years probably which gives them enough confidence to not bother about consumers experience\nonce i was ordering few items like milkcurd and some biscuits and some ten chocolate breads like a loaf or something and it all came upto just 70 bucks or something at first i didnt think anything of itbut when i received the package all the items except the milk and the curd were due to expire the next day i immediately reached out and stated this issue and guess what they said you can consume all these items today itself\ud83d\udc80","17":"zepto high time for you to turn ethical this experience is a culmination of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating had very similar experiences with zepto instamart blinkit etc similar locality\n\nwe were wasting so much time in finding the right product across apps talking to their disinterested support team when quality wasnt good which was most of the time lately and we were throwing away a considerable portion of fresh vegetables and fruits due to bad quality\n\nsince the last few weeks we have gone back to simpler times visiting a super market once or twice a week 2 hrs of effort each week also you should compare the pricing we are saving 810k a month decent side benefit in my opinion","18":"good vegetable delivery services like deeprooted rip recently the service deeprooted was discontinued and transferred to services like zepto instamart and amazon fresh\n\nbefore when my family used to order from deeprooted we used to buy stuff like bokchoi asparagus edamame and other exotic greenleafies now none of them appear to be available on the aforementioned successors zepto instamart and amazon fresh \n\ndoes anybody here know of services at par with or better than deeprooted offering these slightly exotic vegetables and fruits\n\nmy mom asked me for alternatives and i am turning to rbangalore for answers \nthank you gourmet garden is exactly what you are looking for\n\ngourmetgardenin\nmaybe

from freshcompletely spoiled rotten and unusable i was shocked at the poor quality especially considering the premium i paid for this delivery service\n\nwhen i contacted their customer care team to report the issue i was met with the rudest response imaginable instead of offering a solution or even an apology the representative i spoke with dismissed my concerns entirely and made no effort to rectify the situation it felt like they just didnt care about their customers or the quality of their service\n\nive never experienced such bad customer service i wanted to share this to warn others who might be considering using zeptothis is not the kind of service you expect from a company that promises convenience and quality\n\nsurprisingly some of my friends also have encountered such

during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used

market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing

of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company violates the united states donotcall registry status when

the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on september 15th the uk was the first international market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing to expand into new markets its strange though to call the uk a new market given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago while only having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company violates the united states donotcall registry status when sharing promotions phyllis king a delaware resident filed

fyf still i know infinity is better but i am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity\n\nx200b\n\ncredit card bill payments\n\ni am still experimenting here for now with my debit cards axis citi sbi to see which is providing the best net cash conversion from app perspective payments made via paytm have been swift so far though it allows only sbi dc since axis and citi are both mastercard payzapp allows all my dcs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever i have tried this route i am thinking of trying out axis or hdfc native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via dc this month till i find a better option in terms of privacy payment instrument acceptance and reliability i will stick to paytm  sbi dc as my default combo rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria i will settle once i have optimized my dc rewards i have never used cred cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues\n\nx200b\n\nlifestyle expenses\n\nalmost two domestic flights every month homestay bookings prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day as much as possible i prefer to avoid quick commerce  blinkit zepto bb and food deliveries  swiggy zomato and instead go for morningafternoon walks in the park and buy veggiesfruits along my back and whenever i am out at homestays prefer to walk down at least one side to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh this alone results in substantial savings no overpriced buyingconveniencedelivery fees enforces me to remain in shape no need to pay for gym memberships and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle no need to take in vitamin d health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls  much more than any credit card rewards program can offer occoasional fine dining with family 24 times a

probably once a year along with 23 minor ones to driveable distances may target for a family international trip this calendar year  only if i achieve my investment milestone that i am working upon term health insurance movie theatres  barely 4 in an year  only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over ott other things include  utility fuel autocab big ticket purchases  occasional over some years not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics gadgets appliances\n\nx200b\n\ncredit rating\n\ni have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a lucrative offer avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases of liabilities such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds andor settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs but not all of my wants\n\nx200b\n\nepilogue\n\ni still have mostly ltf cards i remember an amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews updates news hacks and what not for the current and future indian credit card holders i hope the community continues to blossom and i am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments man og citi was great bank  sad they left\nas you have so many ltfs which all banks have tried to charge some random fee fine\nwanna swap cards lol","27":"toxic work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information

worklife balance is subjective  \n   i know that everyones experience with worklife balance can be different  \n\n   my goal is to show a general idea of a companys culture based on feedback from the community this way it gives others some guidance even though it might not apply to every individual\n\n3 about adding new companies  \n   someone pointed out that i had added zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers thanks for that  \n\n   now im checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still verifying their hiring status\n\n4 focus on experienced professionals  \n   this list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals but freshers are also welcome to

time is 148 am right now and i decided to order some snacks while watching inception this was my first time ordering with zepto so i got a free premium pass with this order resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know i can send him money over through gpay but i dont know i am skeptical of everyone ever since i got scammed  his insistence of asking to check gpay sounds like fraud to me\nive had this happen with me multiple times zeptoblinkituber delivery guys ke sath fuel ke liye paiserationsschool textbook etc they have always promised to return the money ive always chosen to believe

whos ordered these before can you let me know if i should order from zepto then dont call it a toy maintain the marketed nomenclature of a massager \n\ni dont think anyone gives a damn even if they get to know that youre using a massager for toe curling fun unless they get ideas of forcibly including themselves into the scene with yourself  for which the only solution is to contact the seller and ensuring that they have a discreet packing\n\nand whats more important than the toy is that you get a good anti bacterial lotion to regularly clean it\nhave you checked amazon it would be in a

72k\n\nyes i am aware financially it doesnt make sense to get a house this early but it was my parents dream and i dont care about anything else they sacrificed a lot to get me educated and i would drop my whole pay on them if needed\n\ni give my parents around 50k per month for expenses and other things\n\ni have had to withdraw from my savings multiple times close to 15 lacs in the last 3 years because i had to pay back some loans we had a lot of them and the smile on my parents face as they got less stressed was enough for me\n\nin between i was also working as a amazon delivery boy on weekends to make some more money to invest currently i work as a zepto delivery partner on weekends and rapido now and then  bought a second hand two wheeler a couple of months back\n\ni still use a 7k rupee mi phone but i did spend money on buying iphone 13s for both my parents and my sister wasteful spending yep but i wanted my family to feel and use good products\n\nmy next goal is 50 lacs and to hit 1 cr by 35 if things go well\n\nhow did i reach here\ni was never a bright student just worked crazy hard and studied my ass off to get here and if a dumb guy like me could make it here you definitely can \n\n\nps while i am not experienced or rich enough to offer suggestions if any non tech folks have questions i am happy to answer them  not a lot but this subs standards bro like your

recently a zepto employee admitted to the widespread use of dark patterns in their app revealing strategies designed to extract more money from customers among these tactics the app allegedly charges customers with phones priced over 30000 more than others effectively using devicebased discrimination to increase revenue\n\nthis isnt an isolated case flipkart was recently in the news for charging iphone users more than android users for the same product similarly urban company faced backlash in 2022 for preselecting premium services leading customers to unknowingly pay extra\n\ndark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users consumers can protect themselves by reviewing charges comparing prices and reporting such practices have you faced similar issues country delight is a prime example of employing dark patterns in their business practices they deliberately use nonstandard product quantities like 450g900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg making comparisons harder for customers additionally they push customers into purchasing vip memberships by showcasing misleading discounts which are actually deducted from the membership amount creating a false sense of savings even their cow milk which used to come in 500ml packs has been reduced to 450ml for new customers these practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust the list of such tactics goes on\nthis is an old use case for tech  research has consistently shown iphone users go for paid while android wants free apps have just extended that \n\nive seen hotels do differential pricing for apple vs android its usually because acquiring an iphone customer is more expensive and businesses know they have the ability to pay\n\ni dont know if you remember there was a case of uber charging more based on phone battery i would consider that discriminatory\ndeleted\ni definitely am i have ios and husband had android just last week during nykaa sales i wanted to restock some products and prices were lower on his phone because i had seen a reel too about this so i decided to check\nthis is not particular to zepto almost all the apps record basic details of device when you open it  mobile device brand carrier location and few more based on that they starts to figure out different derived results\nthere are other very advanced ways of deriving user profile by sms reading income credits debits device details availability of user when do u respond to notifications etc all and many more can create very good profile of any one they know your locality and all the others in the area to figure out its type  upscale midscale low scale your prices offers and other variables changes accordingly\n\n\nevery touch and view on device is recorded these days","42":"is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on swiggy blinkit zepto and the others like if im buying a cadbury the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps

explore we go cafe hopping and i have personally explored a lot of new cuisines the gyms here are way better than in any small city the crowd is sophisticated and there is easy cab access anytime anywhere you get good quality products even at small shops not just in malls zomato blinkit and zepto make everything available at your fingertips places like cyber hub and 32 milestone are a whole different world i like watching people at their best everything has its pros and cons so we avoid going out in the rain but otherwise everything is totally fine modernized and easy to access we are

is a multibagger in the makingfrom my pov  \n  \nyou know how you get your productsfood by an amazonswiggy delivery boy in a package right they supply this packaging paper and is a fundamentally

backend companies are most affected by recession\n\n2 the proxy companies can change there supplier anyday depending on there cost\n\n3 growth of suppliers is not as good as the proxy companies had\n\n4imp finding these companies is pretty hard and tricky most of the time you can get targeted by scams or hit by low performing asset\n\n2 the correct approach\n\n1the best way it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is not affected by the operations of a single one\n\n3good and well connected management unlike big companies here connections matter the most as the vendor need huge friend network inside big corporates to reach for there products\n\n3 benefits\n\n1 once business is well settled it will give really good benefits in long run\nso does it mean that pudumjee\u00a0is a monopoly or are there are also other players in the race\n\nanyhow i took a similar approach for ddev plastiks since the company makes cable compounds and plastic compounds that are used in cable and wire packaging footwear pipes automobiles consumer durables electrical appliances electrical and light fittings and electronics\n\nits also the only domestic player manufacturing coating compounds for 132 kv cables with rest being imported increasing house sales and infrastructures such as metro stations hospitals schools are the growth opportunities for this industry and company\n\nbut the share price is not going up and instead steadily decreasing any

easier moving from mumbai to pune\n\ni have been job searching and there are so few product based tech companies in pune\n\ntraffic is bad not as bad as mumbai or banglore plus metro going to be operational in a few years\n\npune also has so many engineering colleges which would provide the talent pool needed\n\ni am an outsider living here for almost 2 years and i like this city locals and outsiders i would like to hear your opinions \n\nwhy arent more product based tech companies moving to  pune\n cause people use misleading heading here \ud83e\udd72\nand i started wondering why not pune\n\nbecause their engineering team is already in bangalore\n\nwhy arent more product based tech companies moving to pune\n\nbecause they are already established in other places and it is not worth it to uproot their whole operation for minimal gains\nmaybe its the product developer base or ecosystem which is already quite established in bangalore these companies typically look for experienced folks and bangalore has the talent pool if it was it services then pune has a significant talent pool but not for product dev thats a different game\nreal reason is the tech talent pool available in bangalore which even pune does not have the rent is just an excuse\npune has commision agents sponsored by kaka","49":"been working on this side project on weekends for a while as i was fed up of

scale by charging us premium speed fees disguised as regular pricing if this is their business model no wonder half of them disappear faster than their delivery time\n\nwhat do you think\n\ud83d\udcac are you okay paying 50 more for instant gratification or are you team wait a day save a lot\n\ncomment below and lets discuss\n\u23f0 convenience vs common sense\n\nps next time ill just set an amazon reminder for tomorrow and spend the 454 on pizza at least thatll arrive hot too \ud83c\udf55 zepto overprices almost everything esp on things where there is no mrp such as green groceries for example 500g3 bananas on zepto costs you rs40 while on amazon fresh or flipkart minutes the same costs you rs 30 while a roadside thela would sell you 6 bananas for the same price not sure if zepto is keen to win this war but surely they are losing it in noida sector where i live a year back zepto riders were a common things to see not anymore\nzepto is building itself to be acquired and not to exist \n\nand that 454 on pizza  via swiggy \nzepto is burning someone elses money to create hype and then be brought out they are not in it for the long run\ni never installed or used it i prefer bbdaily or fresh nothing else i dont want 15 mins rocket fast delivery its bad for local kirana guys as well as for us\nquick commerce is very important for essentialsspecially in mt1 cities\n\neven though quick commerce is trying to venture into the world of regular commodities  including fashion  its still not known how the public of the country will behave  its a bet they have to take\n\nthey have to try exploring the options or else from where the next set of growth will be coming \n\n\n\nregarding the price difference there can be multiple factors \n\n1 the margin at both the platforms will be different amazon buying huge quantities will benefit with a better margin compared to zepto  a new kid in the block with little quantities hence they are not able to match the price\n\n\n2 prices of commodities vary in minutes depending on traffic while amazon price matches quite fast zepto might still be developing the tech and till the time some one notices the diff its too late and they end up losing customers","51":"zepto charging 40 gst \napparently zepto follows a different gst law charging 40 as gst on delivery and small cart fee also using dark patterns to hide the shrewd overcharging under product total which many people might overlook in a big cart feeling good never used this app\nzepto tai\nthe 40 rate is actually correct the gst on aerated drinks is 40 28 and 12 compensation cess as per gst law since the principal supply is taxed at 40 the related services like delivery and handling charges will also be taxed at 40\nswiggy increased their platform fee to rs10\norder above

they dont their objective is to make the highest revenue over the lowest expense\nif you have any issues with them charging stop using their service\nbecause they can\nive seen this a lot of time please know this before posting it here everything is cost for your laziness\nsmall cart fee is for when they wont break even for the dark store and its employees packing your order  \na higher cart value would cover the packing charges supermarkets that do home delivery of groceries over phone callwhatsapp wont take orders for less than 500rs because it should cover packing and delivery charges  \n\ndelivery charges are for the delivery service\nactually they cant charge a huge amount collectively so they divided it into parts \nfor customers satisfaction \ud83d\ude09","53":"why the target market of your startup is 10 million indians only reading about zepto making customers with phones costing more than 30k pay more made me reminisce about my less than ideal target market numbers methodology \n\ni understand this is not methodology that is scientific however if youre working on a venture with a reasonable aov required to sustain and grow your target market is the 10 million who can afford to\n\ni am not talking about low cost services and products that require constant funding from vcs or some other chum to stay afloat if you forget about these vc subsidised offerings and focus on growing on a healthy trajectory these are the only people you need to think about \n\nthis is how i arrived at the 10 million by looking at phone sales data \n\napple is projected to sell at least 12 million iphones in india in 2024 lets say 6 million are buying the high end expensive pro phones and theyre doing this in india which means they live here and will continue to live here and not run away abroad \n\nlets give the rest of the 4  million to samsung and others \nsamsung sells a lot of phones but only a few million high end ones those are the only ones you need to focus on \n\nyour target market is around 10 million people and your projected market is another 10 million at best india is experiencing mass emigration to other countries extreme inequality very high taxes it is very unlikely your target market will grow past 20 million in the next 5 years \n\nforget about the 15 billion people argument 99 wont be useful for your startup focus on the 10 million plan for the 20 million \n\n because unlike what you see on social media majority of india is still poor or not aware enough to consume products that most indian startups are offering  quick commerce or fashion will simply fail in rural india \n\nmost indian startups like zeptozomato employ shady taxes to max out their profit margin from the 10 million userbase\nits a good way to think about the tam but in one of the nikhil kamat podcasts kishor biyani gave a better one i believe he segregated india into their consumption patterns as in india 1 india 2 and india 3 \n\nits worth looking into\nthis makes sense skewed sense because\n\n  \n1 our countrys constitution upholds the right to equality  so zepto and other business can be legally sued for breaching this \n\n2 the 10 million  20 million will wisen up and treat dark models as scams theyll inevitably discard or abandon such apps  sites or businesses relying on such dark models\ni think we should focus more on software businesses and startups think about the tam of google or youtube or facebook they arent just targetting top 10 but anyone with access to a smartphone and not just in india but worldwide new innovative revenue streams must be thought rather than all those we deliver you pay kind of revenue till the time we dont do that america will take all the profit from the bottom layer of our population\nisnt there an error in your calculations 10 mil new phones are being added each year you are completely discounting the fact that most people dont buy a new phone each year\n\nthe target market would be 2x or 3x of the 10m if we assume people buy a new phone every 3 years","54":"this is what i got from zepto diwali box how lucky is too much lucky aur mood kharab hogya ye dekhke\ud83d\ude2d lagta hai unke

manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products subscribing to unnecessary services or revealing personal data\n\nheres a strategy to protect yourself\n\nuse a lowrange smartphone buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for users in the age range of gen z as theyre frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns stay vigilant and always doublecheck before making purchases or

founders behind big startups at national level i have been observing the startup scene in india for a while now i have also had the opportunity to watch good amount of shark tank india episodes one thing that kept me thinking was why dont we see a lot of successful startups at national level either originate from tn or cofounded by tamilians   \nin the last decade the amount of fdi india received is just crazy dogsht companies have been able to somehow convince investors to fund them hugely we are use a lot of products like zomato phonepe ola swiggy zepto zerodha etc some of them are good while good lot of them are burning money but they have been successful enough to capture huge amount of users but why dont i see any tamilian behind any of these big startups  we definitely have the talent to build a good product so whats happening    \n\n\nnote i am talking specifically about tamil cofounders in indian startup ecosystem specifically consumer facing productsservices i know freshworks and zoho are largely successful but i am trying to know if there are more people  \n\n\nif you think that there are people but its just that i havent noticed or dont know kindly comment the companies and the co founders would love to know more about them  theres literally sooo many saas companies in chennai that came out of zoho starting with freshworks and many small ones chargebee rocketlane superops surveysparrow docupilot the difference is most of them are b2b and go into ycombinator and get different levels of funding instead of going through ipo etc in india b2b is much more profitable then b2c for small startups i think you should do more research\nfun fact  a founder friend of mine applied to shark tank was rejected as one of the key criteria was heshe should be able to fluently converse in hindi\na lot of saas startups that branched out of freshworks  zoho mafia have tamil cofounders \n\na few good companies i can recall  factorsai everstage rocketlane kissflow spendflo m2p  chargebee survey sparrow atomic hq mad street deb  growfin  ippopay  most of these are seed and series a type companies\n\nin terms of b2c startups i can think of pickyourtrail  carat lane thyrocare from the top of my mind\n\nimo we have a decent number of startup operators working in top startups i feel we just have a handful of vcs who are based out of tn\n\nwe can definitely do better in all these fronts\ncheck out the start genome report on various startup ecosystems around the world chennais ecosystem is minuscule and yet across the globe there are lots of people from tamiltn backgrounds in this industry globally  so i dont think that it is some sort of lack of talent but i think there is a massive cultural issue in that risktaking seems to be frowned upon and it is a real pet peeve of mine   \n\n\nsecondly as a city chennai lags far behind the other major startup hubs in terms of the social infrastructure required to build a startup ecosystem look up the worlds major startup cities and they are all highly liberal the morons in our city seem to think that this means that we need to have a lot of pubs and bars but thats not the point it is more a case of having an environment that allows intellectual curiosity to flourish an openness to outsiders and a willingness to live and let live as someone from a fairly standard middleclassuppermiddleclass family i think this is hugely lacking in chennai compared to our peers like bangalore etc if i remember correctly the total ecosystem value of chennai was around 11b while bangalores ecosystem was valued at 168b this will inevitably lead to talent drain and momentum while other cities will wither and wane   \n\n\nhopefully the new government will try to arrest this and it looks like theyre trying to do that somewhat with some of the recent startup discussion panels with notable economists like arvind subramanium and raghuram rajan coming to chennai without some drastic action and soon the city will be left in the dust\nwell if you count new briyani shops and real estate companies as startups we far out number em there are many more in it who constantly compares what companies pay and whats the market value of inherited land and wants to deevolve back to farming so that they retain control of inheritance wealth growing the food obviously for profit is far more social service to them than creating a startup that brings employment to masses that dont have a land to cultivate \n\n\nand then the parties the politicians are just too smart it  requires far more intellectual power to go around them and establish the starts up here\n\nits easy to be a king in the land of blind but when the population is too smart its exponentially tough to climb without the legs getting pulled down\n\nthat doesnt mean its impossible as the over smart people are driven out of the state there comes a time when politicians realize it is impossible for politicians to grow their wealth by not letting the worker classes to build up wealth then comes the up cycle again","60":"are we being scammed  so a couple of days ago mum bought some winter

belong to after understanding the concept\n\ngiving you one more framework to understand how companies and business models evolve and how to identify them at early stage of their corporate life cycle and get multi bagger returns you can integrate this framework with the high quality framework to have a more refined filter according to your result expectations\n\njust like people businesses grow mature and eventually decline and their success depends on how well they act their age the corporate life cycle which has six stagesstartup product development high growth maturity decline and demise\n\nearlystage companies burn cash and rely on future potential while mature firms generate stable profits and dividends declining firms face tough decisions to returning cash to stakeholders for valuation startups are valued based on potential and narrative as in the case of\u00a0zomato and swiggy while mature firms like\u00a0tcs\u00a0rely on cash flows and profits declining companies are valued on their liquidation potential\n\nstartups like\u00a0zomato\u00a0in its early days are ideadriven and burn cash to grow often with no profits so you cannot use the framework you need to value a mature business for startups\n\nproduct phase companies have scaling challenges be it local scaling or global scaling business and industry that have the scale elements are multi bagger because only few companies and business model can scalevarun beverages coca cola dominos software companies anything that can scale and  generate profits and fcf and be successfully implemented in different geographies will give multi baggers thats why one should focus on asset light business models which requires less capital to scale\n\nthe\u00a0highgrowth phase\u00a0brings rapid revenue growth but still requires reinvestment so you will see that the companies generates free cash flow but reinvest all for future growth amazon did this for more than 20 years because they had so many reinvestment opportunitiesthis is the best phase to invest because you make most of the returns50100200 baggers when the company transforms from growth to mature stage\n\nmature firms\u00a0like\u00a0hdfc bank\u00a0focus on steady profits and defending market share while companies in\u00a0decline\n\nyou can look at your portfolio and identify which stage of corporate cycle your stock is and drop in the comment section the name of the stock and in which phase of business cycle your stock is\n\nyoung firms attract traders and speculative bets requiring longterm patience to have mutilabggers while mature firms appeal to value investors\u00a0\n\nleadership is an essential element of each phase of growth and it needs to change with time to increase the longevity and returns for investors\n\nstartups need visionaries \u00a0depeinder goyal at zomato or brian chesky at airbn or if you look at the past narayan murthy at infosys because they have to make bold and long term decision and should have risk taking capabilities  growthphase companies require scalefocused leaders and mature businesses need defenders of stability sanjiv mehta\u00a0at hindustan unilever\u00a0\n\nunderstanding the corporate life cycle is critical to know your return profile on your investmentsif you want to have multi baggers you cannot have a 50 or 100x from infosys or itc because they have crossed the 3 essential stages and are now in mature and ageing stage some companies use acquisition to reignite the growth phase but usually its not successfulmature companies make costly acquisition and burn shareholder value\n\none more insight is that tech companies scale faster but age quickly they have a shorter lifespan in comparison to a fmcg medical device maker pharma company banks etcphilip morris diageo hermes have survived centurie and in indies case asian paints itc pharma companies have survived several decades on the other hand tech companies like satyam computer or nokia have a smaller life span of 3040 years\n\nif you are value investor focus on things that are not going to change in this digital word and if you want growth look for disruptors that are going to change the future landscape of a particular industry\n\nsmart management and companies who look to create value for their share holders accept their life stage and act accordinglya startup should not overleverage itself because it can risk its existence recent example would be byjus  and a mature company shouldnt risk its stability chasing lost growth by making expensive

initial suggestion by uvitahex\n\n2018219f1 suggested by killerkalf  flamerheart i recommend to use this one because of a helpful tool that adds lots of vita specific functionality back into unity that they made for it could work with 2018221f1 but cant confirm the github for their tool says it should work with unity 201742f2  special thanks to them for their suggestion time and effort\n\nor 2018221f1 suggested by iakobivarr thanks for your suggestion time and effort\n\na couple of other versions of unity were suggested and i were added based on stability and usefulness\n\nfuck unity as a company too but here are their archives that hopefully never gets taken down \n\nunity has an old vita sdk to make native ports for ps vita\n\nguides  tutorials\n\nvideo tutorial by gamer hq \n\nthey also provided documentation  all the files youll need thank them \n\nvitahex games  robin994 guide \n\nthe guides use unity 201742f2 but should also be useful for the other suggested versions\n\nknown issues the sdk is unoptimized so keep that in mind when making a game because attempting to make something graphically intense  impressive will tank the framerate on vita optimize your code as well  \nthat said if there is a unity port youd like to see but it doesnt exist make  demake your own\n\nthat said can someone get uvitahex to reupload the hallway even just to the internet archive thatd be great\n\ni hope this is all helpful dont ask me any questions about development or trouble shooting because i am not a coder i mainly use clickteam fusion 25 for 2d games and unreal engine 4 for 3d\n\nim working on my own solution for porting clickteam fusion games to ps vita using the baba is you port by vatamanenko as a base wish me luck one thing i would like to add is you can actually go to unity 2018219f1 for psvita support as the files are listed in the google drive also made a lightweight tool a while back to incorporate the unity tool functionality into unity directly  \n\nupdate 82524\n\nedited the list to add suggestions for different unity versions by unity tool makers ukillerkalf uflamerheart and vita porting champ uiakobivarr \n\ni also tried adding breathing room between each engine suggestion to make the wall of text more readable  \ntheres also love2d it doesnt have an editor but it has a great middle ground between gbstudio and pico8s easy exporting and running on any platform and godot and game makers available tools especially for 2d games\nthis is a fantastic little overview i decided to take on making a 2d game with a friend of mine as a little experiment and ended up settling on godot 35 as our development engine because it really did suit our needs better than the other options ive really grown to love it too\n\nfor 3d development i always default to unity 2018\n\nill be interested to have a play with clitckteam fusion when its ported\nhow could you not even mention vitasdk","66":"zepto sellers getting worse  ordered some batteries since the suger

aadit and kaivaliya both are great founders love them but at the rate they are moving which is important thats the most common choice they have to compete in highly competitive market\n\nthey need to highly work in the product before the marketing not having a moat is hurting them in a longterm which im sure they know in the last few months i have seen more 89 switch from zepto to blinkit in family and friends\n\nzepto does have a loyal customer base but its smaller\n\ni dont know how zepto can miss the customer behaviour point because of which they are facing the high churn rate even though its normal for startups like at this stage due many factors like experimenting with pricing user experience and more\n\nif the plan is selling zepto to zomeone or to amazon then i have to say its really interesting to see them moving forward so agressively which make sense considering its an infrastructure game i dont see any acquisition play in the near future\n\nzepto is primarily negative because of investments in infrastructure not on transactional level \n\nuser experience would vary on city level considering that there is still a lot of manpower and operations required to drive qc\nas in industry insider i can say that zepto is doing quite well they operate in less than half the city as the other players but they still have 25 market share and growing theyre burning money but so in instamart but zepto has a warchest and theyre using it well theyll soon be the second largest player if instamart doesnt buckle up they need not sell but yeah if they do want to sell its hot property\nuntil the investor money lasts\nzepto already tried to sell to flipkart but they asked for more price and they rejected so flipkart started their own qcom\nfor a sec i thought

added a handling fee  1 tobacco product convenience fee and delivery fee of 999 19 and 27 respectively which are all understandable\n\nwhat i dont understand is that gst and cess on handling is 4 4004 and on delivery is 1082 4007 respectively last i remember the maximum highest gst was 28 how are they charging approximately 40\n\nalso i noticed although i have zepto pass the free delivery isnt auto applied you have to manually apply it the only thing i hate is\nto have to click on apply to unlock free delivery like bitch who wants to click everyone wants free delivery\nsomewhere we allowed these food delivery appsknowingly or unknowingly to loot us we all became dependent on these apps and somehow we gave them the power and now theyre making profits  with all the access\n1082 is 18 on 56 482 i dont know maybe someone else can shed a light\ngst is 18 balance may be cess due to tobacco\nmany products like sugary carbonated beverages attract a gst of 28 plus 12 cess adding up to 40 your rationale that the maximum gst in india is 28 is wrong","70":"whats up with amazon delivery is it just my bad luck  from the past few weeks i have noticed amazon delivery getting worse day by day most

all this is happening\n\none thing i have noticed the time slots delivery are never accurate on most apps now a days what is a guy supposed to do i they need a product the same day sigh ig thats why

consuming tagz foods chips even before they appeared on shark tank season 1 i had discovered them through cred which used to feature insane discounts on their products then they were selling only on amazon then apart from cred their shark tank appearance gave them a massive boost in popularity and they were now everywhere from instamart and zepto to even my office vending machine they even had clicked stars as their brand ambassadors and now in the last few months i have observed that they have disappeared they are neither available on instamart or blinkit and i havent seen them in any brick and mortar retail store either so what happened to them they seemed very promising then sold to reliance\nthey are still there check on blinkit have signed shikhar dhawan as their ambassador i

ordering from bigbasket since more than a year at first i had issue with bad vegetables once i received small onion completely soaked in water everytime i complain they offer refund without hesitation

date of expiry \n\ni once received nandini goodlife milk out of expiry and spoiled i usually stock milk for a few weeks since nandini can be stored for months i only realised it after a week or so of the order date \n\neverytime they gave refund and said this wont happen in the future great \n\ntoday i received a bigbasket coupon for promotional offer i was delighted and bought two dosa batter both were puffed and spoiled even though date was still under expiry \n\ni complained to the cx and they only refunded for the amount adjusted to the coupon it is fair from their side because thats the amount i paid but what happens to my discount coupon just wasted for this spoiled dosa batters\n\ni am disappointed not for the money or coupon i lost but for the effort i have to take to deal with all this \n\ni have completely stopped ordering and bigbasket since zepto has been giving better products also within minutes for bigbasket in my pincode i have to order the day before \n\nhave you had the same experience i am residing at kakkanad so i guess their hub is somewhere near infopark probably their staff there is mishandling the inventory since they can sell off spoiled products

indias newest unicorn is reshaping retail through data\n\nzeptos growth is undeniable from 50 dark stores in 2021 to over 750 today with plans for 1200 by march 2025 their latest financials show monthly losses tripling from 77 crore to 250300 crore yet investors have poured in 135 billion in 2024 alone why\n\nthe answer lies in what theyre really building a massive consumer behavior database each dark store isnt just a warehouse  its a data collection center tracking thousands of households purchasing patterns brand preferences and price sensitivities\n\nfmcg companies are noticing industry sources indicate major brands are creating zeptospecific products and packages the power dynamic is shifting  when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers traditional retail relationships change\n\nthe expansion raises questions in mumbai alone over 200 local retail spaces now house zeptos dark stores each requires specific zoning permissions affecting local real estate markets meanwhile internal documents mention development of backend mother hubs automation systems even as the company aggressively hires with abovemarket salaries\n\ntheir supersaver feature requires minimum orders of 999  a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics it suggests a broader plan for market control\n\nthe environmental impact deserves scrutiny with 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured\n\nzepto promises an ipo within 24 months while planning major operational changes their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by march 2025 these timelines create interesting questions about their longterm strategy\n\nwhat were witnessing might be more than quick commerce its potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience every order every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how india shops\n\nthe implications warrant discussion how will this affect local retail networks what happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value when does convenience become control\n\nthese arent hypothetical concerns the next time your phone lights up with a zepto notification consider you might be feeding data into a system thats fundamentally changing indias retail landscape one 10minute delivery at a time i bet even dunzo had all these hopes and dreams\ngroupon zynga mayfair blue apron grubhub pandora casper warby parker allbirds all these companies had the same idea of being data driven which is absolutely bullshit \n\nyou could argue that amazon which has a gmv of about 18b in india has far more datapoints on people and pincodes yet they fail to improve their aov in india companies like flipkart myntra and others likely have datasets

refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to

legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform

is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature indecent or inappropriate which has resulted in censorship shadow bans and removal of their advertisements this ones tough to judge on one hand i understand where nood is coming from just because their products are made for womens breasts doesnt intrinsically make their products sexual in nature on the other hand some of noods ads are objectively sexualized designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless only to look closer and discover that shes wearing a skin tone nipple cover many users

they had lawyers to sort things out he later asked for the nowdeleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying so in the example that i gave of the tiktok competitor and by the way i was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybodys music what you would do if youre a silicon valley entrepreneur which hopefully all of you will be is if it took off then youd hire a whole

or have an original idea  is the valuation game just a joke   i left india in my 20s lived in eu for few years  settled in us for 2 deacdes  but still travel globally every week including visits to india every month  so i observe  compare these markets very closely\n\nindia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017 the digital currency ondc  several transformational initiatives stock market is riding high on the modi wave  so is inflation  purchasing power  rupee valuations may be on purpose  has gone down  drastically cost of a good meal is same or higher in india compared to useu  but income isnt comparable\n\ni keep seeing lots of startups coming up  but none are able to succeed on a global platform  several are acquired by west backed competition   most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west \n\nexcept a lenskart  zoho  bookmyshow  a few more handful none of them have succeeded in global arena why is that if the product was good it should have  right   i understand some business need not go global  but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nubers amazons were  able to penetrate indian markets  eat local share  but a ola or flipkart hasnt gone global \nzomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses  oyo has acquired lot of properties  but they just loss making properties  are still in losses  \n\nwith the largest pie of it engineers in the world  we havent had a single appproduct thats globally used we have only been a consumer market with 12  of world population  biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\ni remember using flipkart in the beginning once  the website design  layout itself were a mimic of amazon forget the business model  i had doubts if they will succeed  but ended up being sold for billions \n\nmama earth is a rip off of babyganics including its branding   green colors but its valued at 5000 cr \n\nwe keep seeing lots of half baked products on indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr  \n\nthere was a lot of vc funding coming  so valuation game was on  but lately foreign vc funding  has dried up  as most investments are yielding profits  exits are just based in hype based valuations\n\nzepto is a great example  how a company with no unique ip is valued so much  already people are claiming its model is a failure   not scalable those 2 young kids dont have the same charm or intellect that we saw in gates or jobs when they were young lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nthe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success  whereas in india we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nbut how long will this circus last  only till vc funds dry up or when nririch indians stop pumping into this game \n\n i am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for future entrepreneurs we still have a very good business pan india for example take arun \nwhy indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity once srk said this gurbat me creativity nahi hoti meaning theres no creativeness when youre poor and i personally believe its the reason you see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background other thing i believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture a mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person \ntimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade \npeople are now accepting entrepreneurship is something in india but still we have a long way to go\nindia is kind of late to the technology scene i remember in 19971998 there used to be to 12 computer hardware shops in nehru place while in us dotcom scene was so booming which eventually led to the bubble in 2000 we were so far apart \n\nyou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 1020 years our startup scene only started in around 2007 it takes a good 1015 years to build a solid foundation yes we lag behind  will continue to lag behind usa but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less there are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news which is good actually\n\ngrey orange pine labs postman chargebee rivigo  and so on\nzoho is an outlier currently another 510 years more and well have more indian startups thatll be used globally\ni think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success as you mentioned in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that \n\ntake zerodha for example they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a valueadded product \n\nanother example would be finshots ditto insurance which started off with making finance accessible to the layman currently working towards making insurance available to everyone excellent product and excellent founders going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight\n\nim sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game which will organically shine when their time comes\nthe current startup scene in india fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for unicorn status is  misguided it fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class zomato byjus and swiggy are classic examples\n\nperhaps a more sustainable approach would be for india to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets as peter thiel emphasizes in his book zero to one true startups should focus on creating something entirely new not just replicating existing models zoho and zerodha are commendable examples of indian companies that have done just that\n\nindia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit with a higher proportion of selfemployed individuals than perhaps any other nation except maybe china government and investors should have prioritized established homegrown successes like naga mills haldirams and everest these companies admired internationally for filling genuine gaps represent indias true entrepreneurial strength instead the focus seems to be on lossmaking ventures like ola and swiggy businesses arguably unsuited to the indian markets current needs \n\nperhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging india is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population by fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs india can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders not just a select few\n\nyall stop being copy

minutes of chewing the gum is all it takes for the flavour to disappear the aftertaste for the next 57 minutes was of stevia post that its a tasteless gum the gum also starts to break apart and stick

sharks the arata pitch was good for the humour bit and the negotiation they did with advisory points instead of straight equity \n\n  \ni feel if conscious chemist had similar skills instead of looking defeated theyd have been able to get atleast one shark onboard  especially because namita and vineeta both liked the packaging and the actual formulations","129":"what are you though does it even allowed  hyderabadbased suhas shetty narrated his predicament to startup pedia over a phone call heres the condensed version\n\nmy name is suhas shetty and im the founder of iceberg organic ice creams indias first and only organic ice cream brand weve been around for 6 years and have 50 franchise stores in south india recently we ventured into north india with a dark kitchen model allowing customers to order through swiggy zomato and our website\n\nin 2023 we participated in shark tank india season 3 auditionswe were thrilled to be selected for the final audition in bangalore and filmed our pitch on september 23rd the producers even suggested a bahubali theme for our pitch to boost viewership and we agreed\n\nheres where things went south\n\nconfirmation for our episode airing arrived in januarys 2nd week just days before the season premiere\n\nwe received confirmation that our episode would air on march 29th the season finale however on the 28th they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation\n\nthis news was devastating based on the confirmation email we had shipped nearly rs 15 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country perishable products with a shelf life of just 34 months\n\nsince then ive relentlessly tried contacting the shark tank team they didnt respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month weve even secured a no objection certificate noc from bahubali film producer shobu yarlagadda addressing any themerelated concerns\n\nmy requests are simple air the pitch or feature it in the unseen pitches segment on youtube as done in previous seasons out of 150 pitchers im the only one fateful\n\nfrustrated were desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with blinkit instamart and zepto but for a small brand moving rs 15 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge\n\nwe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency the same is expected from a platform like shark tank india all i seek is a resolution  air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts its should be gone viral on twitter and linkedin then its possible","130":"despite fund raising

mumbai so i am one of the younger members of this sub ill turn 18 in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here 1 ncr has better infra in terms of road size metro etc  mumbai is catching up on that  \n\n2 your experience or impression is bound to change once you live there for few years outside hostel  i used to cross iitb everyday once upon a time for few years \ud83d\ude05\n\n2 given how ncr and mumbai have been built it is tendency to like one city and not the other but not both  opinion is split normally \n\nfor me if someone can take care of my housing in mumbai i will shift there tonight\ni have lived in many cities in india \n\nof course delhi then jaipur mumbai kolkata bhubaneswar pune bangalore these are the cities where is spent at least 6 months ot more many other cities where i spent less time so not mentioning them \n\ngurgaon at least the one on this side of the highway  which excludes the old gurgaon is a very very competitive urban agglomeration vs others in india \n\ni think ahmedabad and hyderabad may be better and mumbai and bangalore in parts \n\nbut overall gurgaon has all the elements of urban living  good school great hospitals good shopping scene restaurants communities are now coming up through huddle etc the career opportunities is what makes it stand out in north india \n\nyes it doesnt have a cultural fingerprint as it is a primarily immigrant settled city but i think with time it will find it its only 20 years old if we are being fair 30 max lets give it another 2 decades \n\nnoida is just too sterile delhi is too big \n\ngurgaon has good balance of everything \n\nmy own thoughts and i know people will have strong opinions but thats ok\nill just pick one aspect of what you said south indian food bombay has a much much larger diaspora of south indians and in gurgaon is close to none as a south indian who was born and raised in bangalore and living in gurgaon since the past 2 years now the south indian food from naivedyam or sagar ratna is not even close to south indian food \n\ni think you just like the taste of south indian food made by these mainstream restaurants\neveryone likes where they were born and brought up theres always a soft spot for the homeland kiddo \n\ni lived 19 years of my life in nepal kathmandu moved to india for uni and job its been 8 years and yet i miss kathmandu and the food there equally how i used to miss em in my initial days comin here not only the food i miss everything actually\nin my experience people are better there doesnt have a showoff culture and place is much secure you dont love a city because of malls food aur 10 min delivery you love a place for the people around you","138":"zepto users beware  today i ordered groceries from zepto and the tomatoes were infested with worms like literally moving worms i did report this to their customer care but seemed like they were deflecting by transferring this chat to higher ups and all such non sense so asking people of bangalore beware when ordering from any such apps because there is no quality check \nfeeling disgusted the warehouse is infested record a video and send an email escalation to the grievance officer of zepto and warning that if the issue is not resolved will report to relevant food authorities and social media handles\n\nhad this issue with instamart and blinkit got it resolved on priority\nzepto swiggy instamart are good for once in while urgent situations we should always buy groceries and veggies fruits from local vendors not even super markets other day i got 1 kg guava from a road side bandi seller is from small village i tried my best to converse with him in my broken kannada he felt so happy and started correcting me for my betterment and he hand picked best of the fruits and gave me 1200 grams for 1kg price which is just 70 those looks like local nati produce i could sense freshness in every bite tasted nice too\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nso the best quality control is you for your family not a multi million corp\ni have experienced the same with zepto  frequently dishes out old veggies including onion\ni have such a terrible experience with zepto cafe received stale and stinky garlic bread they also had the audacity to not provide refundsreturns\nguys i got the refund but there is no remorse nothing it felt like it was another day for them and such things happen all the time but this was eye opener for me bye bye buying groceries online","139":"dmart user tries zepto  \nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later","140":"ordered 1 got 12

jagannath\n\nkichi dina tale there was a post about living conditions and work conditions in bangalore and the language barrier there \n\ndont remember the expost but people were arguing about which place is better than other\n\nwell i shifted from bangalore to bhubaneswar on 1st july after staying there for 3 years\n\nhere are some observations\n\npros of living in bangalore\n1 fast paced life people work hard and you do the same\n2 you see successful people there and that helps you work harder too\n3 you get a better pay over there\n4 the weather is \u2764\n5 the language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\ncons of living in bangalore\n1 the city kind of lost its heart you dont get too many people ready to help you hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers\n2 too many ways to lose money whether its the convenience of zepto blinkit or the expensive goods over there you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nbut bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\npros\n1 the heart i never lived in bhubaneswar my hometown is in keonjhar the can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved here was because i was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents\n\nand i dont regret one bit\n\nlike i said\n\nthe heart of our people is something i love things are just slow in bhubaneswar i personally actually like it\nlaughed out loud on the first con of bhonsor shit is so real\ni shifted from mumbai to bhubaneswar and i dont feel like settling anywhere\n\ni avoid jaydev vihar and beyond areas like patia due to traffic\nthats it\n\nbhonsor is very peaceful and slow you save so so much\ni was born and brought up in bhubaneswar been living in bangalore for almost 12 years now and have left bbsr almost 19 years back frankly apart from weather bbsr is a place i would always want to stay i miss my school and college days congrats and enjoy dahi bara aloo dum\nwhat about financial transition  what difference you face in pay

probably end up with a fake one\n\ni thought of buying one from my gym trainer but still got some trust issues so is blinkitzepto ok or shall i prefer the website of the og protein brand only\n\nbhai samajh hee nahi aa raha kiska protein le kaha se le\ud83d\udc80 check trustified youtube channel he does the independent lab tests for all whey proteins\nsearch google  twitter for liverdoc and whey protein research  results  he had done extensive lab tests to determine what are the actual ingredients and which brands whey protein is closest to its claim  you will get good idea from there\n\nedit  the link  \nas it is whey atom 2kg costed me around 3500 from healthkart  i would recommend buying from healthkart only you can buy muscleblaze as well  but dnt ever think of buying big muscles\nmuscleblaze biozyme has worked well for me it has lab test reports from lab door and they have testing kit which you can buy and test their protein\nas safe guard against copy go for uncommon flavours like vanilla or badam shake mango etc copy makers only copy popular and easy selling flavours like chocolate\nget muscle blaze basic protein from store or healthkartcom its quite clean and

in texture wear etc but the finish is matte it doesnt smudge when lightly rubbed or when water falls on it but peels offdisintegrates when exposed to water and rubbed for this reason i wouldnt recommend this if youre going to be sweating a lot or actively getting wet in the rain long wearing i wore it at around 630 am before going to work and it lasted till at least 230pm or so before it started showing slight signs of wear in the inner corner which tends to happen even with a lot of more expensive eyeliners layers really well so if you want or need to touch up you can do that in a few seconds no problem great for everyday use or if you only wear eyeliner once in a while if you dont normally have any issues with eyeliner smudging or transferring oily lids etc the quality is really good too it didnt irritate my eyes or anything if you have sensitivereactive eyes obviously be careful it is worth noting that insight is one of the cheaper brands that actually mentions all its safety and nontoxicity certifications on its website which is reassuring will definitely repurchase and will update if my experience changes as ive only used it a few times till now \n\nwriting on the packaging has already worn offlol \n\ndries matte\n\nafter 78 hours slight wear in the inner corner but mostly intact and the colour remains intense difference is not noticeable in person\n\n\n\ncurling your eyelashes after washing your face\n\ndisclaimer  youre quite literally playing with fire and potentially hot metal also just like curling hair with eyelashes too there is a danger of breakage damage etc try at your own risk \n\nive been passionate about curling my eyelashes for years now as the difference it makes to my long but zerocurl eyelashes they actually grow downwards is immense ive had my shu uemura lash curler which fits my eye shape perfectly for more than 15 years and it still works perfectly when i curl my lashes during the day or in the evening its all good the problem is when im rushing to work in the morning and have to wash my face or shower and do my makeup immediately thereafter i realised that my eyelashes are not completely dry when i am curling them and that affected the resultless to almost no curl no amount of dabbing with a towel makes a difference the only thing that does give me the result i seek is heating up my lash curler somehow the heat dries up the residual moisture and the curl is much more pronounced i thought of using my blow dryer wellknown tip nothing new but plugging it up heating up the curler and then wrapping the cord nicely and storing it back in its rightful place is just too time consuming when you have exactly 15 minutes max to get ready recently i came across the kbeauty tip of heating up a wooden stick with a lighter and using that to curl or recurl your lashes after mascara i tried this but part of the stick i used user error not the best kind of stick started to singe break off and almost fell into my eyes yikes i noped right out of that idea earlier id also come across a video of someone who used a lighter to heat up their lash curler directly with fire at first i didnt want to try this as the idea of heated metal possibly burning my eyelid was terrifying even to me ive done a lot of stupid experiments in the name of beauty and curiosity in my youth finally though i gave in and ordered a 35 lighter from zepto and cautiously heated up my lash curler only the top half as shown in the pic surprisingly if you use the low setting of the lighter and do a few quick swipes across the length dont hold the flame in one place too long it doesnt even get that hot the one time it did i just put my hands on the metal and the heat transferred to my hands and cooled it down enough for safe use i would even say that while using a lighter you have even more control on how much youre heating it up as opposed to a blow dryer where you might end up heating the whole thing and burning yourself complete game changer lashes on fleek all day every day \n\n\n\n\n\n i miss posts like this when i were in my ug days this is how all the makeup reviews uses to be and i loved them the youtube review can never replace them for me thank you for this post\ncan someone suggest a good eyelash curler im eyeing the nybae one or should i go for vega curler","154":"explain like im 5 things to take care of when cooking chicken hello ladies enbies and other gender queer folks im planning to incorporate chicken into my diet mainly to up my protein intake but ive never handled it in the kitchen before ive eaten it in restaurants though so mainly my confusion revolves around the following aspects\n\n1 which place is better to buy chicken local butcher or apps like zepto blinkit liscious etc on the basis of quality price and any other metrics that may be necessary\n\n\n2 i would prefer to buy from a local butcher because im trying to curb reliance over apps supporting local yada yada in this case what do i say to the butcher i dont want to sound completely clueless what cut size weight etc to ask for how to ensure safety and quality standards are being met and how to know if im being fooled or ripped off\n\n\n3 i mostly plan to buy a bulk quantity that can be safely preserved in the freezer and can be thawed and cooked as needed over 45 days is this even feasible what quantity can i buy and freeze for the maximum possible duration such that it doesnt go bad\n\n\n4 how to tell if the chicken is undercooked is the pinkishness the only way any tips and tricks to not undercook or overcook the chicken or is it only learnt by experience \n\n\n5 what are the easiest and quickest ways to cook chicken i dont think a curry would be possible on week days because of a hectic schedule im mainly thinking chicken soup or small peices on tawa would i have to buy an air fryer for this \n\n\n6 are there any other important things that im missing that i need to take care of when working with chicken \n\n\napologies for the laundry list of questions i have tried googling searching youtube but i didnt find a definitive answer especially on the buying part all help will be appreciated thanks posts with the flair health  fitness are not to seek medical advise but only for recommendations always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with

redact\n1 apps can be useful because they would have segregated chicken breast thighs wings or pieces into different categories but butcher shop can be cost effective you can even make a deal with them if you buy regularly \n2 make sure its an alive chicken they are butchering for quality if you are eating everyday you can have 150 gm of chickencalculate your protein req and remove other protein sources problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces instead get 500 gm of chicken breast i guess there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm ask them not to chop it chicken breast is a good source of lean protein\n\n3 its feasible if you use freezer go for 500 gm in the beginning adjust it as you go\n\n4 this is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked a always cook on low flame b use non stick panatleast in the beginning and make sure to close it with the lid while cooking trust me it makes all the difference c i make chicken tandoori and the marinade makes it soft d when its juicy and glazed with far you know your chicken is ready but dont cook it more than 20 minutes i always use a tbsp of ghee\nchicken legs and wings are easier to cook it takes about 25 minutes i marinade all of these for one hour\n\n5 someone else can help you here i  take a lot of time to cook\n\n6 wings breast legs cook at different time and tastes different alternate your protein source with fish occasionally experiment with a lot of recipes its fun \n\ngood luck\ni have a super easy recipe to make chicken curry that goes well with rice and dosas heres the recipe i made this for my partner since he liked the dish\n\n\n\nits 15 mins if youve pre marinated the chicken with salt and turmeric\nif you are cooking frozen chicken move it into the fridge from the freezer 1012 hours before you cook this is the best way to thaw your chicken\n\n do not keep it outside or submerge it in hot water to thaw"},"cleantext":{"0":["india","grocery","war","deloitte","report","estimate","indian","quick","commerce","massive","40","bn","market","2030","dominant","grocery","model","india","quick","commerce","landscape","2024","rapid","growth","seen","quick","commerce","business","compelled","double","looking","nearly","double","store","count","end","fy25","mukesh","ambaniled","ril","close","launching","quick","commerce","operation","jiomart","looking","deliver","grocery","select","city","30","minute","likely","ramp","operation","year","reliance","reportedly","plan","1000","city","future","jiomart","tap","reliance","retail","network","18000","store","country","kind","scale","allow","jiomart","potentially","catapult","existing","group","quick","commerce","swiggys","end","nascent","ambition","tataowned","bigbasket","flipkart","flipkart","fresh","fund","google","majority","stakeholder","walmart","likely","major","push","grocery","created","welloiled","playbook","outdated","chart","big","basket","delivers","within","1015","min","dmart","job","started","getting","known","isnt","analysis","chat","outdated","bigbasket","multiple","mode","jio","mart","picking","jio","mart","worst","quick_commerce"],"1":["fragrance","collection","random","hotwheels","car","started","collection","2022","10th","grade","arranged","favourite","favourite","right","left","hotwheels","car","smell","kinda","metallic","rusty","0","performance","favourite","look","cool","2","pendora","scent","noir","en","leather","clone","tom","ford","ombre","leather","yesterday","1k","friend","used","twice","bit","early","favourite","smell","damn","opening","kind","spicy","main","note","cardamomelaichi","doesnt","long","dry","rich","syntheticbut","best","way","possible","ultra","fine","refreshing","leather","definitely","daily","love","3","random","attar","clone","tobacco","intense","company","called","kannauj","perfume","200","r","stall","set","apartment","week","smelt","original","sure","copy","great","value","money","really","smell","tobacco","sweet","fresh","performace","pretty","4","salvatore","ferragamo","bright","leather","big","discount","34k","opening","citrusy","fruity","grapefruit","dry","musky","soft","smooth","leather","fragrance","pleasant","overpowering","strong","noir","en","leather","5","jaguar","classic","black","daily","24k","blinkitzeptoi","remembervery","generic","mass","pleasing","really","hand","note","us","fresh","slightly","spicy","tinge","great","summer","frag","used","year","round","moderate","performance","bottle","dishevelled","bag","school","everyday","6","ajmal","silver","shade","bored","jaguar","12k","fresh","citrusy","metallic","wrong","heard","clone","creed","silver","mountain","water","idk","far","thats","true","performance","decent","jaguar","classic","black","7","decant","beardo","whiskey","smoke","friend","gave","free","spicy","winter","frag","pretty","mid","tho","say","8","villain","edp","perfume","2022","used","love","finished","bottle","within","year","sweet","dark","fresh","smelling","new","bottle","isnt","strong","performace","suck","barely","last","30","minute","idk","changed","formulation","anymore","reason","high","nostalgia","9","adidas","ice","dive","gifted","cousin","smell","pretty","decent","fresh","citrusy","sporty","wouldve","ranked","way","higher","performed","barely","last","hour","forget","abt","projection","ustra","scuba","cologne","fragrance","collection","actually","despise","supposed","fresh","aquatic","synthetic","harsh","complete","mess","literally","abt","waste","ur","money","shelfies","show","tell","without","review","description","dedicated","discussing","expressing","love","perfume","person","experience","fragrance","differently","value","everyones","unique","perspective","posting","shelfie","solely","showcase","collection","without","contributing","allowed","review","posted","perfume","mandatory","action","performed","automatically","contact","moderator","subredditmessagecomposetordesifragranceaddicts","question","concern","try","macerating","hotwheels","car","yes","searching","actually","bought","travel","atomizer","thingysi","heard","9","piece","leak","confirm","deny","specific","amazon","link","sell","higher","quality","one","thanks","silver","shade","noir","en","leather","bright","leather","performance"],"2":["minute","fresh","food","becoming","india","theyre","trying","solve","problem","really","existed","swish","cafe","bolt","promising","fresh","food","min","shit","frozen","foodfast","food","reheated","complaint","saying","felt","uneasy","sick","swish","food","theyre","riding","gimmicky","investor","money","burning","cash","running","fake","pr","linkedin","recently","came","tweet","alleging","cafe","using","kind","dirty","trick","undercut","fulfill","order","question","really","min","food","step","somethingwhich","btw","feel","startup","gimmicky","min","required","exploitation","ill","fresh","food","min","joke","want","hear","btw","person","talked","scoffed","idea","calling","unnecessary","quest

2022 when i was in 10th grade\narranged from favourite to least favourite right to left\n\n1 hotwheels car smells kinda metallic and rusty 0 performance its my favourite as it looks very cool\n\n2 pendora scents noir en leather clone of tom fords ombre leather got it yesterday for 1k from a friend who didnt like it and used it only twice it might be a bit too early to call this my favourite i know but it smells so damn good to me \nopening kind of spicy with the main note of cardamomelaichi this doesnt last very long though\ndry down rich and syntheticbut in the best way possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance very pleasant not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather\n\n5 jaguar classic black\nmy daily go to got it for 24k on blinkitzeptoi dont remembervery generic and mass pleasing cant really put my hand on what notes it uses but its fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge great summer frag but can be used all year round moderate performance the bottle is so dishevelled because i keep it in my bag for school everyday\n\n6 ajmal silver shade \ni use it sometimes when i get bored of jaguar got it for 12k on zepto fresh citrusy and metallic cant go wrong with this also ive heard its a clone of creeds silver mountain water but idk how far thats true performance is decent same as jaguar classic black \n\n7 decant of beardo whiskey smoke\nfriend gave this to me for free spicy winter frag pretty mid tho dont use it much nothing else to say here\n\n8 villain edp\nthis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 i used to love this and i finished a whole bottle of it within a year sweet dark and fresh smelling but this new bottle just isnt as strong and performace sucks barely lasts 30 minutes idk if they changed its formulation or what its just not the same anymore the only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia \n\n9 adidas ice dive\ngot gifted this by my cousins smell is pretty decent fresh citrusy and sporty wouldve been ranked way higher if it performed barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection\n\n10 ustra scuba cologne\nthis is the only fragrance in my collection i actually despise supposed to be

actually contributes to society\n\nwe all know that these people running promotions initially will show numbers and revenue but theres no way they can sustain plus the exploitation of labour is unmatched there is no justification to that and most importantly no need for it\n\nmight be wrong would like to hear more opinions my question is we live in a world full of real issues why are we supporting shitty ideas like swish and zepto cafe just because they cater to like 01 of the people why not put it in places where it actually contributes to society\n\ni dont want to be rude but your statement comes across as a bit naive and coming from idealism instead of realism we live in capitalistic society 10 min delivery apps exist because of the same reason amazon exists\n\nhumans want things these apps remove friction stepping down from your apartment requires effort walking or driving to get food or other things requires effort\nwhat labor exploitation these delivery guys are making 810x the money they were making previously \n\npeople have moved real far from their homes because the earning opportunity and demand is so high\n\nstep down and get some food  have you ever been to india dude i would step down and fall into an open manhole and never be able to get food \n\nclearly you have no clue what youre talking about nor know how much real demand there is for such an app in india and other developing countries\nthat business model isnt sustainable it basically pressures riders which arent even employed theyre on commission to take unnecessary risks that puts them and other people in danger\n\nweve had some startups in spain with a similar idea groceries in under 10 minutes but they are mostly gone now\nbecause investors enable bs startups like that these investors are looking to launder their illgotten gains and what better vessel than to dump money into copypaste churnandburn startups led by tech grifters not sure why we dont talk about how vc is a massive massive money laundering machine for the moneyed and it gets especially worse in new money regions like india india btw is the definition of new money\n\nsource i will never invest with indian vcs again and i am talking well known name brand individuals\ni am not sure how they are managing to cook the food and deliver it in under 10 minutes maybe they have limited inventory i dont know what i do know is the delivery person will break 10 traffic rules just to be on time plus injuries to himself or anyone on the road plus there is this other thing where people are ready to risk themselves for money you cannot claim that zomato or swiggy is liable for any damage either overall its a win win for these companies and they are just pushing the envelope and one day it will all break"}]],"3":[[{"negative":0.9511814117,"neutral":0.029353125,"positive":0.019465398,"aspect":"zepto","text":"why are 10 min fresh food delivery apps becoming a thing theyre trying to solve a problem

so they want to put in money into the hottest thing that they find\nbecause bigger temporary revenues bigger stock prices investor money  ipo ultimately its a game to unload these unrealistic valuations on the retail investors nothing else the owners and pe vc firms get to cash out\njust like amazon and walmart make money off of their own labels\n\nzomato will make more money selling coffee from their own cafe cloud kitchen vs delivering coffee from starbucks\n\nwith blinkit zomato went after kirana stores with these 10 mins food delivery theyre going after the unknown small dhabas  restaurants  home kitchen\nexactly my point they are just playing passing the parcel \ud83d\udce6 game to increase the valuation and grt a good exit\nmost of the food that gets sold follows a pareto principle with key food items being biryanipizza and a few other hero products that get sold the most 10 minutes of food delivery doesnt have to mean 2 minutes of preparation for highvolume goods their demand can be predicted and thereby a fast predictive supply chain can be built to service this demand for lowvolume skus these brands can quote higher service durationtimelines \n\nas far as it being sustainable etc is a question that these firms need to answer if enough people keep ordering and the retention is sustained this can be solved not sure why people are being so paranoid the same happened with grocery delivery as well if grocery is a 10 min thing then readymade food absolutely makes sense quality needs to be figured out and i guess it will eventually

card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for

2024 hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past 3 years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass 100b in 2024 and a global audience of 22b users this makes facebook the mostpopulous and bestmonetized social media platform in the world\n\nshopify released its full winter 25 edition  dubbed the boring edition  featuring 150 updates designed to make merchants businesses run smoother i cant tell you how many times ive said something like i wish shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools and now my dreams have come true i hope that shopify continues this boring edition tradition for years to come as a developer and merchant the updates contained in this recent edition are longawaited and highly appreciated check out the comments on this post where ill share a list of highlights from the boring edition\n\namazon announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of amazon autos a platform that will initially offer hyundai vehicles to us customers amazon autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 us cities to browse order finance and schedule pickup of a new hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on amazon amazon says that

vertical or square aspect ratios they can also bring their own assets to extend remix and blend or create entirely new content from text\n\nshopify made shop campaigns available to all of merchants in the us and canada an advertising tool that was previously only available to shopify plus merchants shopify describes them as riskfree campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with shop merchants only pay for conversions when new or existing customers convert while shopify takes care of optimizing the creative audience and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets to clarify one thing  shop campaigns arent driving traffic to the merchants store but rather to their products and storefront within the shop app however once the customer makes a purchase through shop app they become part of the merchants customer database and email  sms list if they optin\u00a0\n\nwix introduced a new genai tool called ai sitechat that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers the tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 247 including when there are no customer service representatives available ai

more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its more in core shift which is aimed at giving merchants a fullyintegrated set of functionality outofthebox without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions\n\nin other automattic  wordpress news this week a group of wordpress contributors including longtime core committers and community leaders issued a call for changes to the governance of the opensource project urging matt mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally in an open letter entitled dear wordpress community we stand with you the contributors raised objections about governance transparency and decisionmaking processes of the organization highlighting concerns about double standards including mullenwegs lack of accountability under the projects code of conduct and the executive directors direct employment by automattic\n\nthe open letter follows an order by a california district court judge for automattic to stop blocking wp engines access to wordpressorg resources and interfering with its plugins\n\namazon is joining the likes of blinkit zepto and swiggy instamart in india with its new

hindi word that means fast or quick amazon already operates amazon fresh in the country which offers a twohour delivery service and the 15minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers\n\nmeta is supporting elon musks effort to block openais conversion from a nonprofit company into a forprofit one the company sent a letter to california attorney general

on\nexpedition team\n\nthis is a critical update from the research base on rouge v weve begun analyzing the samples youve sent back and our findings have raised significant concerns\n\nrecent intelligence reports indicate that something other than terminids is present in your area the terminids themselves are displaying unprecedented behavior becoming increasingly erratic and hostileeven to each other they appear to be attacking and consuming one another to grow larger a behavior we have never observed before\n\nthis anomaly suggests the presence of an unknown factor within the containment zone signatures from the area imply that you may have unexpected companyentities that are not terminids\n\nremain vigilant and exercise extreme caution if your expedition detects any unusual activity or encounters any nonterminid entities report back immediately your safety and the integrity of the mission are our top priorities\n\nstay sharp out there\n\ndr kane\n\nend

theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service india

of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by zepto as a quickcommerce provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they

adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform

10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers

the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many

october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance

ecommerce \ud83d\udd25 week of july 22nd 2024 hi\u00a0\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on september 15th the uk was the first international market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing to expand into new markets its strange though to call the uk a new market given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago while only having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu

communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executives privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years which is a luxury that isnt

richard crone a payments consultant justified the move by noting that you cant pay for a credit card with a credit card but then again richard you can oftentimes do a 12month interestfree balance

close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a

that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need

tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media

companys culture based on feedback from the community this way it gives others some guidance even though it might not apply to every individual\n\n3 about adding new companies  \n   someone pointed out that i had added zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers thanks for that  \n\n   now im checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still verifying their hiring status\n\n4 focus on experienced professionals  \n   this list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference it can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures\n\n\nedit\n\nsorting it alphabetically so that it is

actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know

in the news for charging iphone users more than android users for the same product similarly urban company faced backlash in 2022 for preselecting premium services leading customers to unknowingly pay

delight is a prime example of employing dark patterns in their business practices they deliberately use nonstandard product quantities like 450g900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg making comparisons harder for customers additionally they push customers into purchasing vip memberships by showcasing misleading discounts which are actually deducted from the membership amount creating a false sense of savings even their cow milk which used to come in 500ml packs has been reduced to 450ml for new customers these practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust the list of such tactics goes on\nthis is an old use case for tech  research has consistently shown iphone users go for paid while android wants free apps have just extended that \n\nive seen hotels do differential pricing for apple vs android its usually because acquiring an iphone customer is more expensive and businesses know they have the ability to pay\n\ni dont know if you remember there was a

not as good as the proxy companies had\n\n4imp finding these companies is pretty hard and tricky most of the time you can get targeted by scams or hit by low performing asset\n\n2 the correct approach\n\n1the best way it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is not affected by the operations of a single one\n\n3good and well connected management unlike big companies here connections matter the most as the vendor need huge friend network inside big corporates

automobiles consumer durables electrical appliances electrical and light fittings and electronics\n\nits also the only domestic player manufacturing coating compounds for 132 kv cables with rest being

way to think about the tam but in one of the nikhil kamat podcasts kishor biyani gave a better one i believe he segregated india into their consumption patterns as in india 1 india 2 and india 3 \n\nits worth looking into\nthis makes sense skewed sense because\n\n  \n1 our countrys constitution upholds the right to equality  so zepto and other business can be legally sued for breaching this \n\n2 the 10 million  20 million will wisen up and treat dark models as scams theyll inevitably discard or abandon such apps  sites or businesses relying on such dark models\ni think we should focus more on software businesses and startups think about the tam of google or youtube or facebook they arent just targetting top 10 but anyone with access to a smartphone and not just in india but worldwide new innovative revenue streams must be thought rather than all those we deliver you pay kind of revenue till the time we dont do that america will take all the profit from the bottom layer of our population\nisnt there an error in your calculations 10 mil new phones are being added each year you are completely discounting the fact that most people dont buy a new phone each year\n\nthe

of tamil founders behind big startups at national level i have been observing the startup scene in india for a while now i have also had the opportunity to watch good amount of shark tank india episodes one thing that kept me thinking was why dont we see a lot of successful startups at national level either originate from tn or cofounded by tamilians   \nin the last decade the amount of fdi india received is just crazy dogsht companies have been able to somehow convince investors to fund them hugely we are use a lot of products like zomato phonepe ola swiggy zepto zerodha etc some of them are good while good lot of them are burning money but they have been successful enough to capture huge amount of users but why dont i see any tamilian behind any of these big startups  we definitely have the talent to build a good product so whats happening    \n\n\nnote i am talking specifically about tamil cofounders in indian startup ecosystem specifically consumer facing productsservices i know freshworks and zoho are largely successful but i am trying to know if there are more people  \n\n\nif you think that there are people but its just that i havent noticed or dont know kindly comment the companies and the co founders would love to know more about them  theres literally sooo many saas companies in chennai that came out of zoho starting with freshworks and many small ones chargebee rocketlane superops surveysparrow docupilot the difference is most of them are b2b and go into ycombinator and get different levels of funding instead of going through ipo etc in india b2b is much more profitable then b2c for small startups i think you should do more research\nfun fact  a founder friend of mine applied to shark tank was rejected as one of the key criteria was heshe should be able to fluently converse in hindi\na lot of saas startups that branched out of freshworks  zoho mafia have tamil cofounders \n\na few good companies i can recall  factorsai everstage rocketlane kissflow spendflo m2p  chargebee survey sparrow atomic hq mad street deb  growfin  ippopay  most of these are seed and series a type companies\n\nin terms of b2c startups i can think of pickyourtrail  carat lane thyrocare from the top of my mind\n\nimo we have a decent number of startup operators working in top startups i feel we just have a handful of vcs who are based out of tn\n\nwe can definitely do better in all these fronts\ncheck out the start genome report on various startup ecosystems around the world chennais ecosystem is minuscule and yet across the globe there are lots of people from tamiltn backgrounds in this industry globally  so i dont think that it is some sort of lack of talent but i think there is a massive cultural issue in that risktaking seems to be frowned upon and it is a real pet peeve of mine   \n\n\nsecondly as a city chennai lags far behind the other major startup hubs in terms of the social infrastructure required to build a startup ecosystem look up the worlds major startup cities and they are all highly liberal the morons in our city seem to think that this means that we need to have a lot of pubs and bars but thats not the point it is more a case of having an environment that allows intellectual curiosity to flourish an openness to outsiders and a willingness to live and let live as someone from a fairly standard middleclassuppermiddleclass family i think this is hugely lacking in chennai compared to our peers like bangalore etc if i remember correctly the total ecosystem value of chennai was around 11b while bangalores ecosystem was valued at 168b this will inevitably lead to talent drain and momentum while other cities will wither and wane   \n\n\nhopefully the new government will try to arrest this and it looks like theyre trying to do that somewhat with some of the recent startup discussion panels with notable economists like arvind subramanium and raghuram rajan coming to chennai without some drastic action and soon the city will be left in the dust\nwell if you count new briyani shops and real estate companies as startups we far out number em there are many more in it who constantly compares what companies pay and whats the market value of inherited land and wants to deevolve back to farming so that they retain control of inheritance wealth growing the food obviously for profit is far more social service to them than creating a startup that brings employment to masses that dont have a land to cultivate \n\n\nand then the parties the politicians are just too smart it  requires far more intellectual power to go around them and establish the starts up here\n\nits easy to be a king in the land of blind but when the population is too smart its exponentially tough to climb without the legs getting pulled down\n\nthat doesnt mean its impossible as the over smart people are driven out of the state there comes a time when politicians realize it is impossible for politicians to grow their wealth by not letting the worker classes to build up wealth then comes the up cycle

to have a more refined filter according to your result expectations\n\njust like people businesses grow mature and eventually decline and their success depends on how well they act their age the corporate life cycle which has six stagesstartup product development high growth maturity decline and demise\n\nearlystage companies burn cash and rely on future potential while mature firms generate stable profits and dividends declining firms face tough decisions to returning cash to stakeholders for valuation startups are valued based on potential and narrative as in the case of\u00a0zomato and swiggy while mature firms like\u00a0tcs\u00a0rely on cash flows and profits declining companies are valued on their liquidation potential\n\nstartups like\u00a0zomato\u00a0in its early days are ideadriven and burn cash to grow often with no profits so you cannot use the framework you need to value a mature business for startups\n\nproduct phase companies have scaling challenges be it local scaling or global scaling business and industry that have the scale elements are multi bagger because only few companies and business model can scalevarun beverages coca cola dominos software

2024 alone why\n\nthe answer lies in what theyre really building a massive consumer behavior database each dark store isnt just a warehouse  its a data collection center tracking thousands of households purchasing patterns brand preferences and price sensitivities\n\nfmcg companies are noticing industry sources indicate major brands are creating zeptospecific products and packages the power dynamic is shifting  when a delivery platform knows consumer preferences better than product manufacturers traditional retail relationships change\n\nthe expansion raises questions in mumbai alone over 200 local retail spaces now house zeptos dark stores each requires specific zoning permissions affecting local real estate markets meanwhile internal documents mention development of backend mother hubs automation systems even as the company aggressively hires with abovemarket salaries\n\ntheir supersaver feature requires minimum orders of 999  a strategy that could influence purchasing behavior combined with rapid expansion and advanced data analytics it suggests a broader plan for market control\n\nthe environmental impact deserves scrutiny with 750 continuously cooled dark stores and thousands of individual deliveries replacing consolidated shopping trips the carbon footprint of convenience remains unmeasured\n\nzepto promises an ipo within 24 months while planning major operational changes their current cash burn suggests new funding needs by march 2025 these timelines create interesting questions about their longterm strategy\n\nwhat were witnessing might be more than quick commerce its potentially a sophisticated retail control system being built under the guise of convenience every order every click feeds an algorithm that could reshape how india shops\n\nthe implications warrant discussion how will this affect local retail networks what happens when algorithms control product visibility based on perceived customer value when does convenience become control\n\nthese arent hypothetical concerns the next time your phone lights up with a zepto notification consider you might be feeding data into a system thats fundamentally changing indias

couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023 this volume equates to 7143 packages per person 5144 parcels per second and

also introduced a cashback rewards program where customers can earn up to 10 cash back when using the klarna app to shop at participating retailers in europe klarna already has a banking license has offered similar services in germany since 2021 and is now expanding itll offer customers interest rates as high as 358 for savings in the us klarna doesnt have a banking license and is operating through partner banks its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the us as the money held isnt protected by the fdic there is also no interest offered to us customers\n\ntiktok users in the us who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to 300 in discounts or a 100 amazon gift card for every new creator they refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for thirdparty messaging apps like whatsapp to share and discuss videos\n\nftc announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials

insider reviews misrepresentation of companycontrolled review websites and review suppression ftc chair lina khan wrote fake reviews not only waste peoples time and money but also pollute the

that unlawfully game the system on notice and promote markets that are fair honest and competitive see my other post in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules \n\nsoundcloud launched a merch marketplace called soundcloud store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch the first edition of the store features designs from wiz khalifa denzel curry wolfacejoeyy bktherula armani white and other people ive never heard of before the artist submits a design soundcloud creates mockups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its soundcloud store from there soundcloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch the service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100 of the profits from sales \n\namazon is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products either that or amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake  paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them amazon told fortune that the limited test only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages \n\nx is closing its operations in brazil but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being according to a post from its globalaffairs account which wrote last night alexandre de moraes threatened our legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform

mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and

isnt comparable\n\ni keep seeing lots of startups coming up  but none are able to succeed on a global platform  several are acquired by west backed competition   most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west \n\nexcept a lenskart  zoho  bookmyshow  a few more handful none of them have succeeded in global arena why is that if the product was good it should have  right   i understand some business need not go global  but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nubers amazons were  able to penetrate indian markets  eat local share  but a ola or flipkart hasnt gone global \nzomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses  oyo has acquired lot of properties  but they just loss making properties  are still in losses  \n\nwith the largest pie of it engineers in the world  we havent had a single appproduct thats globally used we have only been a consumer market with 12  of world population  biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\ni remember using flipkart in the beginning once  the website design  layout itself were a mimic of amazon forget the business model  i had doubts if they will succeed  but ended up being sold for billions \n\nmama earth is a rip off of babyganics including its branding   green colors but its valued at 5000 cr \n\nwe keep seeing lots of half baked products on indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr  \n\nthere was a lot of vc funding coming  so valuation game was on  but lately foreign vc funding  has dried up  as most investments are yielding profits  exits are just based in hype based valuations\n\nzepto is a great example  how a company with no unique ip is valued so much  already people are claiming its model is a failure   not scalable those 2 young kids dont have the same charm or intellect that we saw in gates or jobs when they were young lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nthe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success  whereas in india we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nbut how long will this circus last  only till vc funds dry up or when nririch indians stop pumping into this game \n\n i am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for future entrepreneurs we still have a very good business pan india for example take arun \nwhy indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity once srk said this gurbat me creativity nahi hoti meaning theres no creativeness when youre poor and i personally believe its the reason you see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background other thing i believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture a mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person \ntimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade \npeople are now accepting entrepreneurship is something in india but still we have a long way to go\nindia is kind of late to the technology scene i remember in 19971998 there used to be to 12 computer hardware shops in nehru place while in us dotcom scene was so booming which eventually led to the bubble in 2000 we were so far apart \n\nyou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 1020 years our startup scene only started in around 2007 it takes a good 1015 years to build a solid foundation yes we lag behind  will continue to lag behind usa but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less there are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news which is good actually\n\ngrey orange pine labs postman chargebee rivigo  and so on\nzoho is an outlier currently another 510 years more and well have more indian startups thatll be used globally\ni think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success as you mentioned in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that \n\ntake zerodha for example they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a valueadded product \n\nanother example would be finshots ditto insurance which started off with making finance accessible to the layman currently working towards making insurance available to everyone excellent product and excellent founders going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight\n\nim sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game which will organically shine when their time comes\nthe current startup scene in india fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for unicorn status is  misguided it fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class zomato byjus and swiggy are classic examples\n\nperhaps a more sustainable approach would be for india to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets as peter thiel emphasizes in his book zero to one true startups should focus on creating something entirely new not just replicating existing models zoho and zerodha are commendable examples of indian companies that have done just that\n\nindia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit with a higher proportion of selfemployed individuals than perhaps any other nation except maybe china government and investors should have prioritized established homegrown successes like naga mills haldirams and everest these companies admired internationally for filling genuine gaps represent indias true entrepreneurial strength instead the focus seems to be on lossmaking ventures like ola and swiggy businesses arguably unsuited to the indian markets current needs \n\nperhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging india is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population by fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs india can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders not just a select few\n\nyall stop being copy

startup india created over 1553 lakh 15 million direct jobs additionally dpiit recognized 140803 entities as startups as of june 2024 the consistent efforts of the forum have made india the third largest ecosystem for startups after the us and china in march 2024 at startup mahakumbh pm narendra modi announced the existence of 125 lakh 125 thousand startups and 110 unicorns in the country highlighting the economic potential\u00a0\n\nstartup india is a comprehensive initiative that supports the growth and development of the startup ecosystem it has provided regulatory support for the organization of the landscape by ascertaining the development of optimal frameworks some of the recent developments in the arena include finance bill 2022 single master form smf one person companies opcs and more the government is providing an incubator framework to provide the necessary resources such as infrastructure mentorship and financial support to nurture innovation in startups india has

unicorn space including nbfcs nonbanking financial company conversational messaging cryptocurrency exchanges d2c directtoconsumer cloud kitchens and more at present 1 out of 10 unicorns globally are born in india\u00a0\n\nindia is considered the most friendly startup country according to the 2021 survey of ceo world magazine this is primarily attributed to the availability of a technical workforce increased investment in upskilling the workforce escalating focus on rd adequate availability of resources and favorable policy framework additionally increasing digitalization and progressive government initiatives such as make in india and atmanirbhar bharat are also contributing to the development of the startup ecosystem in the country\u00a0\n\nthe growth of the startup

peaks of  241 billion 2021 and  182 billion 2022 in 2023 the number of new tech unicorns fell to two however the decline in funding promoted the prioritization of business fundamentals among tech

members of this sub ill turn 18 in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here 1 ncr has better infra in terms of road size metro etc  mumbai is catching up on that  \n\n2 your experience or impression is bound to change once you live there for few years outside hostel  i used to cross iitb everyday once upon a time for few years \ud83d\ude05\n\n2 given how ncr and mumbai have been built it is tendency to like one city and not the other but not both  opinion is split normally \n\nfor me if someone can take care of my housing in mumbai i will shift there tonight\ni have lived in many cities in india \n\nof course delhi then jaipur mumbai kolkata bhubaneswar pune bangalore these are the cities where is spent at least 6 months ot more many other cities where i spent less time so not mentioning them \n\ngurgaon at least the one on this side of the highway  which excludes the old gurgaon is a very very competitive urban agglomeration vs others in india \n\ni think ahmedabad and hyderabad may be better and mumbai and bangalore in parts \n\nbut overall gurgaon has all the elements of urban living  good school great hospitals good shopping scene restaurants communities are now coming up through huddle etc the career opportunities is what makes it stand out in north india \n\nyes it doesnt have a cultural fingerprint as it is a primarily immigrant settled city but i think with time it will find it its only 20 years old if we are being fair 30 max lets give it another 2 decades \n\nnoida is just too sterile delhi is too big \n\ngurgaon has good balance of everything \n\nmy own thoughts and i know people will have strong opinions but thats ok\nill just pick one aspect of what you said south indian food bombay has a much much larger diaspora of south indians and in gurgaon is close to none as a south indian who was born and raised in bangalore and living in gurgaon since the past 2 years now the south indian food from naivedyam or sagar ratna is not even close to south indian food \n\ni think you just like the taste of south indian food made by these mainstream restaurants\neveryone likes where they were born and brought up theres always a soft spot for the homeland kiddo \n\ni lived 19 years of my life in nepal kathmandu moved to india for uni and job its been 8 years and yet i miss kathmandu and the food there equally how i used to miss em in my initial days comin here not only the food i miss everything actually\nin my experience people are better there doesnt have a showoff culture and place is much secure you dont love a city because of malls food aur 10 min delivery you love a place for the people around

zepto  \nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later"}]],"140":[[{"negative":0.0332357623,"neutral":0.8056931496,"positive":0.1610710621,"aspect":"zepto","text":"ordered 1 got 12 \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 ordered one register and and 12 plus i used

too many ways to lose money whether its the convenience of zepto blinkit or the expensive goods over there you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nbut bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\npros\n1 the heart i never lived in bhubaneswar my hometown is in keonjhar the can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved here was because i was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents\n\nand i dont regret one bit\n\nlike i said\n\nthe heart of our people is something i love things are just slow in bhubaneswar i personally actually like it\nlaughed out loud on the first con of bhonsor shit is so real\ni shifted from mumbai to bhubaneswar and i dont feel like settling anywhere\n\ni avoid jaydev vihar and beyond areas like patia due to traffic\nthats it\n\nbhonsor is very peaceful and slow you save so so much\ni was born and brought up in bhubaneswar been living in bangalore for almost 12 years now and have left bbsr almost 19 years back frankly apart from weather bbsr is a place i would always want to stay i miss my school and college days congrats and enjoy dahi bara aloo dum\nwhat about financial transition  what difference you face in pay

from healthkart only you can buy muscleblaze as well  but dnt ever think of buying big muscles\nmuscleblaze biozyme has worked well for me it has lab test reports from lab door and they have testing

cosmetics no smudge eyeliner\n\nthis reminds me of the maybelline hyperglossy eyeliner in texture wear etc but the finish is matte it doesnt smudge when lightly rubbed or when water falls on it but peels offdisintegrates when exposed to water and rubbed for this reason i wouldnt recommend this if youre going to be sweating a lot or actively getting wet in the rain long wearing i wore it at around 630 am before going to work and it lasted till at least 230pm or so before it started showing slight signs of wear in the inner corner which tends to happen even with a lot of more expensive eyeliners layers really well so if you want or need to touch up you can do that in a few seconds no problem great for everyday use or if you only wear eyeliner once in a while if you dont normally have any issues with eyeliner smudging or transferring oily lids etc the quality is really good too it didnt irritate my eyes or anything if you have sensitivereactive eyes obviously be careful it is worth noting that insight is one of the cheaper brands that actually mentions all its safety and nontoxicity certifications on its website which is reassuring will definitely repurchase and will update if my experience changes as ive only used it a few times till now \n\nwriting on the packaging has already worn offlol \n\ndries matte\n\nafter 78 hours slight wear in the inner corner but mostly intact and the colour remains intense difference is not noticeable in person\n\n\n\ncurling your eyelashes after washing your face\n\ndisclaimer  youre quite literally playing with fire and potentially hot metal also just like curling hair with eyelashes too there is a danger of breakage damage etc try at your own risk \n\nive been passionate about curling my eyelashes for years now as the difference it makes to my long but zerocurl eyelashes they actually grow downwards is immense ive had my shu uemura lash curler which fits my eye shape perfectly for more than 15 years and it still works perfectly when i curl my lashes during the day or in the evening its all good the problem is when im rushing to work in the morning and have to wash my face or shower and do my makeup immediately thereafter i realised that my eyelashes are not completely dry when i am curling them and that affected the resultless to almost no curl no amount of dabbing with a towel makes a difference the only thing that does give me the result i seek is heating up my lash curler somehow the heat dries up the residual moisture and the curl is much more pronounced i thought of using my blow dryer wellknown tip nothing new but plugging it up heating up the curler and then wrapping the cord nicely and storing it back in its rightful place is just too time consuming when you have exactly 15 minutes max to get ready recently i came across the kbeauty tip of heating up a wooden stick with a lighter and using that to curl or recurl your lashes after mascara i tried this but part of the stick i used user error not the best kind of stick started to singe break off and almost fell into my eyes yikes i noped right out of that idea earlier id also come across a video of someone who used a lighter to heat up their lash curler directly with fire at first i didnt want to try this as the idea of heated metal possibly burning my eyelid was terrifying even to me ive done a lot of stupid experiments in the name of beauty and curiosity in my youth finally though i gave in and ordered a 35 lighter from zepto and cautiously heated up my lash curler only the top half as shown in the pic surprisingly if you use the low setting of the lighter and do a few quick swipes across the length dont hold the flame in one place too long it doesnt even get that hot the one time it did i just put my hands on the metal and the heat transferred to my hands and cooled it down enough for safe use i would even say that while using a lighter you have even more control on how much youre heating it up as opposed to a blow dryer where you might end up heating the whole thing and burning yourself complete game changer lashes on fleek all day every day \n\n\n\n\n\n i miss posts like this when i were in my ug days this is how all the makeup reviews uses to be and i loved them the youtube review can never replace them for me thank you for this post\ncan someone suggest a good eyelash curler im eyeing the nybae one or should i go for vega curler"}]],"154":[[{"negative":0.3475815356,"neutral":0.1555745453,"positive":0.4968439639,"aspect":"zepto","text":"explain like im 5 things to

them if you buy regularly \n2 make sure its an alive chicken they are butchering for quality if you are eating everyday you can have 150 gm of chickencalculate your protein req and remove other protein sources problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces instead get 500 gm of chicken breast i guess there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm ask them not to chop it chicken breast is a good source of lean protein\n\n3 its feasible if you use freezer go for 500 gm in the beginning adjust it as you go\n\n4 this is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked a always cook on low flame b use non stick panatleast in the beginning and make sure to close it with the lid while cooking trust me it makes all the difference c i make chicken tandoori and the marinade makes it soft d when its juicy and glazed with far you know your chicken is ready but dont cook it more than 20 minutes i always use a tbsp of ghee\nchicken legs and wings are easier to cook it takes about 25 minutes i marinade all of these for one hour\n\n5 someone else can help you here i  take a lot of time to cook\n\n6 wings breast legs cook at different time and tastes different alternate your protein source with fish occasionally experiment with a lot of recipes its fun \n\ngood luck\ni have a super easy recipe to make chicken curry that goes well with rice and dosas heres the recipe i made this for my partner since he liked the dish\n\n\n\nits 15 mins if youve pre marinated the chicken with salt and turmeric\nif you are cooking frozen chicken move it into the fridge from the freezer 1012 hours before you cook this is the best way to thaw your chicken\n\n do not keep it outside or submerge it in hot water to thaw"}]]},"absa_sentiment":{"0":"neutral","1":"neutral","2":"negative","3":"negative","4":"positive","5":"positive","6":"negative","7":"neutral","8":"neutral","9":"positive","10":"neutral","11":"neutral","12":"positive","13":"neutral","14":"neutral","15":"negative","16":"negative","17":"negative","18":"positive","19":"negative","20":"positive","21":"negative","22":"neutral","23":"neutral","24":"negative","25":"neutral","26":"positive","27":"negative","28":"positive","29":"neutral","30":"negative","31":"neutral","32":"neutral","33":"neutral","34":"negative","35":"positive","36":"neutral","37":"negative","38":"neutral","39":"negative","40":"neutral","41":"negative","42":"neutral","43":"positive","44":"neutral","45":"positive","46":"negative","47":"neutral","48":"negative","49":"neutral","50":"negative","51":"negative","52":"negative","53":"negative","54":"positive","55":"positive","56":"neutral","57":"negative","58":"negative","59":"negative","60":"negative","61":"positive","62":"negative","63":"negative","64":"positive","65":"positive","66":"negative","67":"positive","68":"negative","69":"negative","70":"negative","71":"neutral","72":"neutral","73":"negative","74":"neutral","75":"negative","76":"neutral","77":"neutral","78":"positive","79":"negative","80":"negative","81":"positive","82":"negative","83":"neutral","84":"positive","85":"negative","86":"positive","87":"negative","88":"negative","89":"negative","90":"neutral","91":"neutral","92":"neutral","93":"negative","94":"neutral","95":"neutral","96":"neutral","97":"neutral","98":"positive","99":"negative","100":"negative","101":"neutral","102":"neutral","103":"positive","104":"positive","105":"neutral","106":"negative","107":"positive","108":"neutral","109":"negative","110":"neutral","111":"negative","112":"negative","113":"positive","114":"neutral","115":"negative","116":"neutral","117":"neutral","118":"neutral","119":"neutral","120":"negative","121":"negative","122":"neutral","123":"neutral","124":"neutral","125":"positive","126":"neutral","127":"negative","128":"positive","129":"positive","130":"negative","131":"neutral","132":"neutral","133":"neutral","134":"positive","135":"positive","136":"positive","137":"positive","138":"negative","139":"negative","140":"neutral","141":"positive","142":"neutral","143":"positive","144":"neutral","145":"positive","146":"neutral","147":"neutral","148":"positive","149":"positive","150":"positive","151":"positive","152":"neutral","153":"negative","154":"positive"}}
