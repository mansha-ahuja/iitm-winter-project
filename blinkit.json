( Found this community much more active and understanding, so posting my concern here ) I've done a Diploma in Computer Engineering but had to drop out from my B. Tech 2nd Year due to some personal reasons. I don't have any high-paying jobs since I have any skills that can get me a decent job. But with some basic skills, I'm making good enough to pay my bills. Currently, I'm trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else. And the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap.\n\n**How I fall into a debt trap:**\u00a0I tried to be a nice guy in Covid times and I helped my brother-like best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black Covid days. But I never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life. I helped him with all my savings and investments from Stokes. I was a fool, and for the sake of friendship, I helped him. He never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates. This stupidity made me fall into a 15X bigger debt trap than what I had helped him with. Other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap. My dog met with an accident, the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didn't give us deposit amount in return, Broker ran away with our money, I met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine, got scammed by someone worth of \u20b910,000 and still never got it back since the bank is SBI and we know how it works, recently my $160 worth of Crypto got stolen which I had received for completing tasks, and that was literally my last money in hand. :( Such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this.\n\n**What's my current status:**\u00a0I was in total debt of \u20b915 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me, I called my father and told him about my situation. I couldn't tell him everything because, in a conversation over a call, he thought that I was too stressed and might harm myself. I didn't wanted to give him more stress so I didn't tell him everything. But he still managed me around 5 lakhs and I paid my over dues. Now he thinks everything is clear but it's not. I cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as I was capable of. I worked as a Blinkit delivery partner, I worked for one YouTuber, and so on.\n\nNow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only \u20b990,000 is what I need on urgent basis. The rest amount is from some close people who're never gonna ask for it back but I'll return it asap I save something.\n\n**What's in that \u20b990,000:**\n\n**\u20b916,000:**\u00a0Ring Power Loan ( From Instant Loan App ) Overdue of 15+ Days and they're constantly calling every 5 min and knocking on my door every day. If I don't repay it tonight by 9, they'll reach my parent's house in my hometown and that would be a disaster for my life. My father will never talk to me again and my Girlfriend who has supported me in this bad time, I won't be able to marry without my parent's permission. I don't want to lose the love of my life and neither the respect of my parent's just for a small amount of money.\n\n**\u20b913,000 + \u20b919,000 + \u20b913,000:**\u00a0I had borrowed this from known people but as I promised them to pay last month, I couldn't pay them and now they're constantly calling me and want their money back. I can't keep them ignoring or they might talk to any of my brothers or father about this. Yes, I know I'm late and I'm really capable of paying them this amount instantly and they're not ready to wait for a few days.\n\nThe rest is small fractions of the amounts and that will take a very long paragraph to explain the story.\n\n**How I'll pay back:**\u00a0I've applied for the Rapido captain job. No matter what happens, I'll do my best to make \u20b91500 a day from Rapido. It might sound hard but I've to do it and I'll do it. Along with that I've a small work from one YouTuber that pays me \u20b99000 a month, and a small source of Income is Affiliate Income which can pay my daily bills. So whatever I'll earn from Rapido and other Gigs, I'll keep on paying it every week. Within 3-4 months I'll surely clear this with whoever kind-hearted person hear to help me.\n\nMen can understand the pain and shame of asking for money from your father or someone else when you're all capable of earning. Writing this post makes me feel so guilty but if I had any other option, I wouldn't be writing here, right? I'm all on my own, I'm trying my best but the pressure of paying for everything on time and the stress of other stuff is not letting me focus on my learnings. I don't blame anyone for this situation. I'm the only person who's responsible for this. I'm not really a fraud person. I'm seeking genuine help, please help me out and I won't forget you guys for my life.\n\nEven today when I call my parents, they never fails to ask me that \"Ab toh sab thik hai na?\", Mummy is like \"Kuch ho toh bata dena, aur bada mat kar dena wapis, tere papa befizul ka tension lete rehte hai.\" How I'm supposed to say her that nothing is okay, I'm stuck at the last stage. I've come really far and almost at the door step of a Stress-Free life. All I need is a saviour who can hold my hand and pull me up inside that stress-free world.\n\nIf you've come so far and read the whole post, I appreciate your patience. Thank you so much for giving your valuable time. You can reach me out for more info in my DMs. I would be happy to share everything you want to know. Even I'm ready to give you my ID details as well.","853":"It was 1 AM when I realised that I've got no water left, I was thirsty, water from blinkit was costing around 90 rupees, so I visited a nearby 24\/7 and 2 water bottles somehow costed me 134 rupees???????

It was trembling the _whole_ time. I also got her a small bowl of milk (that was all i had, we don't drink milk at home but I had bought some last night for the cat).\n\nIt was quite scared so I sat a lil away. Once it was done eating, it ran away sadly. The car owner had to move the car so he shooed it away for its own good. I spotted the cat at another house's roof so know it's still around and would probably cry for food again :(\n\nAlso, I have never ever interacted with a cat before this, so it was a bit scary for me.

This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing.

These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns.

I personally think I can tap into this time frame and ease the process for users.\n\nMy solution -\nLocal pharmacy  first approach, plan is to not set up dark stores or store inventories by myself. We use the already existing inventories from our local pharmacy and deliver it as soon as possible. This will definitely remove the leg work users have to go through to reach to there local pharmacy and we will  aid in bridging the gap and let the users have access to all local pharmacies in the mobile app.\n\nDo let me know what you guys think about it.","1325":"So i posted about Frozen fruit as a product in India and its market (post 1 link) \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StartUpIndia\/s\/VbYNVTUQAJ\n\nSo yesterday I tried to do it in a home freezer just to try it with flavours, textures, and feel of a frozen fruit\n\nI got Kiwi and Dragon fruit,\n\nI cut them into beautiful small cubes, added 4 flavours \n\n1.

You can't eat frozen fruit directly it just like an ice cream difference is you lick ice cream most of the time or its creamy but fruit is like an ice cube it was hard, have to give some time to eat after putting them. Out of freezer\n\n2. So I got some 20+ pieces overall because I wanted to get taste test done from my family members and as we were eating and discussing they started to melt (again weather problem India is too hot and humid) \n\n3. Add on Flavours started to melt away as well\n\n4. Although fruit was able to maintain there texture and taste plus point so it does increase shelf life if done properly\n\n5. Cutting a fruit properly to maintain equal size is difficult and time consuming and as well it creates wastage \n\n6.

The drones flies to the nearest point and mounts on top of the vehicle(auto\/cab\/etc.,) to mount the vehicle would have a mounting stand on its roof top.\n   5. During the drone travelling with the package on top of vehicle also the backend algorithm tries to calculate the optimal path and tries to send optimal path to drone.\n      1. Scenario 1: If vehicle stuck in traffic, then algorithm navigates drone to move to other vehicle which is nearer.\n      2. Scenario 2: When vehicle is taking different route than the destination, then the drone with the signal from backend algorithm tries to navigate to different vehicle.\n\n\u00a0\n\n* This method is useful in cases of emergencies, medicine from one part of city to another of city within no time.\n* The business like zepto\/blinkit can reduce their dark stores.\n* The delivery price can be reduced as we are depending on vehicles for most of the transport part.\n* The complications happens from the drones can be reduced.\n\nI hope I can get lot of insights from talented people out there.","1342":"Are you looking to buy things from a known seller than a bot?

Tata is also losing Neu costumers who aren\u2019t active on the Neu app, whereas its other businesses are doing well individually. \u00a0\n\n* More than 25 to 30% users let their Neu coins expire without claiming them, as most users don\u2019t visit the app frequently.\u00a0\n\n* Most Tata Neu card users are using their credit card for UPI spends and redeeming it for low value items.\u00a0\n\n* Also, Tata Neu card users use the Tata Neu Rupay card with other UPI apps. (Tata has made it mandatory to use Tata neu app to gain 1.5% UPI cashbacks from Aug 1,2024)\u00a0\n\n* The super app doesn\u2019t have UI consistency, the Tata digital team just used their internal Dev team and rushed the app to launch for Tata IPL 2022, most UI bugs are still under progress.\u00a0\n\n* There have been very little investments made towards customer support (Call center) and they have been repurposing internal Tata Digital staff.\u00a0\n\nWhy won\u2019t Tata Neu survive?\u00a0\n\n* Tata neu marketing team is basically dead, their Instagram and Twitter (X) posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement.\u00a0\n\n* Blinkit beats Bigbasket by a mile, Tata 1mg users just stick to that app, ONDC orders are negligible, and people just use Zomato\/Swiggy. \u00a0\n\n* Premium users of Tata Cliq, Vistara and IHCL (Taj) don\u2019t give a shit about the buggy app.\u00a0\n\n* Amazon is still preferred over Chroma (Online delivery) and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app.\u00a0\n\nWill Tata Neu shut down?\u00a0\n\n* Basically Tata, Jio and Adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning. \u00a0\n\n* Now comes the spicy part, Tata has a reputation problem, and it may not shut it down as it's a pathway to all its other profitable business (except BigB).\u00a0\n\n* But through internal team messages and emails it's clear that Tata has no proper plans to make it survive. \u00a0\n\n I know so many users in this community have Tata Neu card, what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down?\n\n\u00a0","1682":"I have been a CRED member for quite some time.

The card offers 2% cashback there, but I\u2019m a little confused:\n\nDo I need to make payments via UPI linked to the card to earn the cashback?\n\nOr will I get the cashback regardless of whether I swipe the card at the POS or pay via UPI?\n\n\nIf anyone has experience with this card, I\u2019d love your guidance!

","1689":"**TL;DR (though I insist, pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a): The Flipkart Axis card, despite its bad reputation, offers significant benefits for frequent Flipkart  shoppers, including  beyond 5% cashback and additional perks. Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S.

Then, this month I am noticing that they have added a 2.5% processing fee for Amazon shopping vouchers which was not there till last month. This effectively reduces the actual benefit derived from the reward points for an Amazon voucher. For example, previously buying 10000\/- worth voucher would give you 1650 points giving value of 10k in voucher and 1650 to be redeemed but now, you have to pay 10290\/- to get the same thing effectively still only giving you a value of 10k as a voucher and 1650 as points but 290\/- has been taken from you from the sum total in the beginning it self.

I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback?

Food Delivery: Approx. 16k+ (using Park+ to get vouchers for Zomato or buying directly from Swiggy or MagicPin)\n\n2. Groceries: 6k (from Zepto, Blinkit, BB etc.)\n\n3. Traveling: 10k (RedBus, IRCTC and GOIBIO)\n\n4. E-commerce: 15k (mostly on Cred, Amazon, FKor various websites, often paying through gateways like Razorpay, Mobikwik, and Amazon Pay)\n\n5. The rest are just offline spends , petrol and maybe utility \n\nI only received Rs. 1,200 as cashback when it should be over 2000. Something is wrong, and I cannot see how much cashback each transaction has earned, like I can on ICICI or HDFC card statements.\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed with this.

Also, please do provide your inputs. \n\nMy cc portfolio \n\nAxis atlas - 2.5 L (paid)\n\nAmex platinum travel card - 3.1 L (paid)\n\nHSBC live + - 1.5L (paid)\n\nAxis airtel - 2.5L (paid)\n\nHDFC Moneyback+ - 98k (ltf)\n\nOnecard - 78k (ltf)\n\nKotak dream 811 - 65k (ltf)\n\nIdfc millenia - 35k (ltf)\n\n\nSo my strategy is to bucket out credit cards and strictly stick to it\n\n1) utilities and food\n\nI use airtel axis for all the bill payments and my phone and wifi. I have airtel connection. Also, i use it on swiggy zomato for spend of 5k only.\n\nI use amex platinum to buy apay vouchers and pay bills if the utility crosses 2.5k which in my case happens everytime. I buy eatsure vouchers for food too.\n\n2) shopping\n\nI try to use amex just to hit 4L milestone. After the milestone i tend to use atlas as it provides great redemption value on accor hotels.\n\nI also look for deals by buying vouchers from smartbuy and amex gyftr platform.\n\n3) travel\n\nI have lounge access on amex, atlas and that kind of caters to my need. I use atlas as it provides 5x miles on travel. I usually redeem against accor and find a great deal which sometimes gets a 18% return. Dm me if you wanna know how to get it.\n\nAlso, mr points are used for hilton bookings.\n\n4) offline spends\n\nI use hsbc live plus for dining and grocery stores. Also it is used on zepto and blinkit. Once i exhaust 5k limit on axis airtel, i use this card for food.\n\nAxis atlas for all offline spends as it is my primary card. I use amex where ever possible just to hit that 4L spend target.\n\nIdfc Rupay Cc is used on qr payments\n\n5) Others\n\nI use all othet cards for bank offers in sales on amazon, myntra, ajio, flipkart.\n\n\nBonus - i use hdfc debit card to juice out extra (iykyk)\n\nMy annual returns have come roughly to 7.4% after deduction of fees. I paid roughly 16.7k in fees. \nI feel that as my spends and income increase, i ll be able to hit roughly 11-12% solely through travel spends.\n\nI am planning to get a standard charter card for insurance payments. View about it????\n\nAny advice, suggestions is welcome. Should I surrender any of the cards in my portfolio which might make sense ?\n\nFew of the cards have been recently added. Will post my progress next quarter and ll Update the community. :)","1765":"I don't want to use Amazon pay,  but attracted to it's cashback.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","1816":"Hii, can anyone help me out to suggest best cc for online grocery shopping via apps like zepto, blinkit, afresh.

I had a word with the RM who told me HDFC is no longer offering any LTF cards (My parents have Regalia LTF CC issued around 7 months back). I was also told about the 3 Lakhs spends in a year to avail the annual fee waiver. Tbh, I do not see myself spending such an amount over an year.\n\nI do not hold any other CCs except Niyo Global CC (which I had used for international payments during travel) and an HDFC Regalia add on card (for lounge access). Primarily the CCs are used for one international trip during the year and lounge access, but I do not mind using a CC if I get cashback on Amazon, Uber, Ola, Blinkit and Zomato. (since I frequently use these apps)\n\nWould you say the HDFC Diners Privilege is worth holding onto? Also is it true that HDFC is not offering LTF cards?

Oh you need a packet of milk too. Take a non stick kadai, warm it up, put all the milk there, add half a cup of water because packaged milk are too dense always, and let it simmer once. Add the grated carrots, and stir it at medium flame for 2-3 minutes. \n\nNow, the heavy lifting is over and it's a waiting game. Lower the induction to lowest ( mine has 100, 350, 700, 1100, 1400... ) setting and took it down to 350 and let it stay for 10 minutes. Keep stirring every 5 minutes or so. \n\nThen you put the heat to 100 ( even lower ) and cover it, and let it stay. Play a BGMI game, that's what I did. Some kid from Hyderabad had choicest of abuses for me in Telugu too Idk why. So play with mic muted. He might be asking me to come to his location but it's really a bad word for me to hear \/s \n\nYou keep this whole thing for an hour or so, and most of the milk will be soaked by then. You can increase the heat to boil off the excess milk but keep stirring when heat is high. Add a tablespoon of ghee ( clarified butter, but since this isn't Masterchef Aus call it ghee )  and stir it well. This is the frying part. \n\nAdd sugar as per your need, I'm not much of a sweet tooth so it wasn't much, put on medium flame and stir. As sugar caramelizes, you'd notice the chance in colour. Put on lowest flame. Chop some cashew, almond & raisins finely. Add them in that and mix it once.

Apparently, she had twisted her ankle while on stairs. She further told the doctor that she is supposed to be travelling sometime mid of next week and that she didn't want to take chances as her travel involved extensive walking. I normally dont pay attention to others but she was crisp clear in her speech and it was difficult to ignore her words. \n\nAfterwards, the doctor completed his examination, told her some movements and exercises and advised her to apply ice pack on the strained area. And then the women started asking some questions around ice pack. This is where the crux of the story lies and i really paid attention to her words. \n\nHer questions were:\n1. How often to apply ice pack? \n2. How long should i apply in 1 sitting? \n3. Is ice water bath and ice pack the same? \n4. What happens if i dip my feet in ice water? \n5. Where should i apply the ice pack? \n6. Should I change the place around the sprained area when applying ice?\n7. Can i walk with sprained ankle? \n\nAnd many more frivolous question of which above 7 are just a glimpse. After she had gone, even the doctor murmured something in kannada (most likely i was on the lines of - she had so many doubts) \n\nHere I got thinking that have we come to this stage where we are loosing most simplest of the home remedies known to humankind for ages (through hit and trial and experiment). That we are not able to preserve handed down knowledge from our elders in this information and digital age. That we have become so handicapped that we need expert opinion on how to apply ice pack??\n\nI try hard not to judge people on thier lack of information (and sometimes common sense) but seeing this ~50 years lady asking so many questions just on the ice pack unnerved me to the point where I started questioning the utility of all this advancement around me (in financial services, 10min delivery, medicine etc). On one hand these things have improved life standard but on the other hand, these have made us so reliant and handicapped that if blinkit\/zepto were out of vegetables for some days, some people would probably end up eating packaged food for days without bothering themselves to go to local store and buy groceries on their own. \n\nPeople should be considered about their health and right ways of doing exercises\/posture etc. But should we be so ignorant that we are having to ask minute things to professionals? \n\nI always thought that generations of millenials and onwards would be most poor in their general knowledge and common sense (being first to be exposed to mass consumer internet, rampant googling tendencies and wide internet access because of cheap rates) but seeing a middle aged person so poorly eqipped to take care of her own health makes me worried about the future of humans.

I'm writing this because I just wanted to offload all this from my chest.\n\n**Little About Me**\n\nI'm a 24-year-old boy from Ahmedabad. My family lives in a different city and I live here with my other roommates who are eventually my far and close cousins only. I'm an unemployed guy with no job skills. I'm currently trying to learn Web Development but mental stress is not letting me focus on anything else.\n\nThere was a time in 2020 when my life was on track and was going as I wanted to. But then covid hit. Covid wasn't the problem at all. But I helped my best friend with the money and that kindness of mine started spoiling my life. Since then so many series of unfortunate events never let me come out of the debt trap I am currently in.\n\n**Helping My Friend Saga**\n\nIt was mid-2021 and I used to do swing trading at that time. Me and my other two friends were running one app that was related to fantasy cricket. In starting it was working well. We were teenage kids and making very much enough from our small app. But after the COVID hit, that app business got ruined. But I had made enough savings from it that I could easily do trade in the market and it was going pretty well as well. One day I was supposed to get an amount of \u20b960,000 somewhere but for some reason, I had to receive it in my best friend's bank account. ( It was fine, we were like real brothers and it wasn't the first transaction we had done like that. )\n\nLong story short, he used that amount to pay off his dad's debt that his dad had taken from some local person who gave money on interest. He just used the whole amount without even informing me at all. I knew him for years and I knew there must be a good reason for him to do that and there was. After hearing the reason, I said, \"It's alright, don't worry\". But that's not all, after a few days he called me and asked for another \u20b910,000 to pay his loan overdue. I was like \"What are you doing man, is everything alright?\" And just like that within 2 weeks I gave him \u20b980,000. I was a college kid and It was my savings only so I was all okay with that since I did not have much use for that shortly. But I never knew what kind of trouble I was inviting for me.\n\n**Story After The Help**\n\nThat time it was lockdown so I was at my parents. But soon everything opened up and I had to come back to Ahmedabad for my college. I had almost nothing in my pocket. I had to sell out my portfolio for my rent, food and deposit amount. Now my only income source was also closed. I had decided that I'd never ask for money from my parents. I wish I could have asked for it by leaving my self-respect or ego aside. Instead, I called and asked him for a date on which he could return my money. If not the full amount, then some portion at least. He said within a month he'd give me half something amount. I asked him twice, if he was sure of this or not. And he said yes, he'll give me back half the amount in a month. So I borrowed my monthly expenses from someone else for a month. And of course, he didn't pay me on time. And I had to embrace that guy from whom I had borrowed money. My friend told me he'd give the full amount next month, but I had no faith in him now. Still, I asked my lender to give me another month and this time he asked for interest. I had no other option except to accept this. And guess what, my friend didn't give me anything next month either. At that point, for the first time in my life, I had to go to Instant Loan apps and take loans from there to pay off my debt caused by my friend. From this, the cycle of my debt-taking from Instant loan apps started. I had no other option. He kept on giving me dates. This blunder became a mess day by day.\n\n**Series Of Unfortunate Events in August 2023 - Flat Shift and Taboo Mindset Of The Society**\n\nIn August 2023 we had to shift our flat. We were now a total of 8 roommates so we found a good bungalow with good affordable rent. Everything was shorted. Even we confirmed with the owner if there's any issue related to bachelors living in the society or not, and he said there's no issue. We vacated the old flat, loaded our all stuff in the truck and reached to the bungalow. When we reached there, the watchman didn't let us go inside. The society secretary came and said bachelors are not allowed in our society. I talked with the owner, he came and talked to the secretary. After talking with the secretary he came to us and said \"Ab mana bol rahe hai yeh log. Jab ki pehle maine inko bata rakha tha.\". I was like are you kidding me? What are we supposed to do now? I had asked you earlier as well and you said there's no issue and now you're saying this shit? Where I'm supposed to go? We were officially homeless that day. We even found another flat but it was expensive and out of our budget, still, we finalised it and we started unloading our stuff from the truck. We had almost shifted all our stuff to the 7th floor and then some society ladies came and asked us who permitted us to unload the truck.? We're not letting bachelors live here in our building. Humare ghar mein bhi jawan ladkiyan hai. I was frustrated for the whole day and again it started like that. I told her that who do you think we are? A rapist? Are crazy or what? We've already paid the deposit to the owner and he has no issue then who are you guys having a problem with who's living in the owner's flat? They didn't listen to anything and called the owner and scolded him as if it was her flat. Even threaten him If he'll let us live here, she'll call the police. And that owner didn't want any other stress so he just refunded our deposited money back and we were homeless for the second time in just one day. We had to pay the truck driver 4 times more than the pre-decided fare because of keeping him with us all day. The biggest challenge was where we were going to spend the night and where we'd put our stuff because we couldn't keep it in the truck anymore. There was a friend of ours who had one empty shop which he was using as a godown. Even that friend took rent from us. So we unloaded our all stuff there and then requested our previous owner to let us spend the night at the older flat which we had vacated. Thankfully he understood our situation and he agreed. That day was the most horrible day of my life. Had no extra money and something like that happened was crazy.\n\nIn Ahmedabad, nobody was ready to give a flat to any bachelor. The broker we found that day was really helpful. He did everything to get us flat. We had a really good bond with him. And after staying homeless for another 3 days, we finally found another bungalow. It was cheap, and we desperately wanted a roof over our heads. We slightly checked out the property and made the deal. But after living for a day there, we get to know there are many issues that we couldn't identify before, you can only get to know that after spending a day or two. We requested the owner to refund us our rent by cutting one-day charges but why would someone do that? That heartless person gave us just half the rent amount. I had no words for what to tell him. He knew all these problems were there but he didn't mention them. He was like I've 50 properties, main kya yeh sab dekhne baithu? He was so rude and he had all our money with him, so we couldn't say anything to him.\n\nOn top of that while going to visit one property we met with one small accident. It wasn't our fault at all. A spoiled kid was driving a new car and made an unexpected left turn without a side light on. The new car got big scratches, and he was a nephew of Gunda od that area. Had to give another \u20b95000 there.\n\nNow I was at a stage where I didn't even have enough money to pay the deposit and rent. Here we've to pay two times of deposit of rent and one rent in advance. There's no way I can get money. I had to take loans from instant loan apps online.\n\nOn top of that screen of my laptop got broken while shifting. Now I can't even learn those skills that I was learning to get a job. I had no money to repair that screen.\n\n**India Pakistan World Cup Match Made Us Homeless Again**\n\nWe finally got a flat, it wasn't good but that's the only option we had. And it was beyond our budget but we had to take it. We spent a month there, but it was way too far from the roommate's office and there was not much development around it. People from Ahmedabad might know that there's not much available for bachelors near Agora Mall. So after a month, we requested the owner that if he could give us our full deposit back, we would like to shift. Usually, as per the agreement, you can't vacant property within 6 months of shifting, and if you do, you'll lose your deposits. But here we had requested the owner that if he could give us our deposit, then and then only we can to vacant, otherwise no. So that was the time of the World Cup and the IND-PAK match was happening in Ahmedabad. There were no hotels available for stay. The owner's relatives got tickets for the match but they couldn't get any hotel to stay. And they were coming from Kolkata. So what he did was horrible. He forcefully made us vacant the flat. He didn't want to spend a lakh on a hotel just for 1 day stay so he chose to give us 50% of our deposit and made us homeless again. He threatened us in every possible way. We couldn't do anything except leave the house. Trust me these people's connections are so strong that you can't do anything. We didn't even have money to give the fare to the truck driver. Lucky this time we got a stay at my friend's place. We spend the whole month there.\n\nI had given \u20b915,000 to that broker who had helped us to find that flat. I urgently needed that and we had become good friends by that time. At that time it was extra money I had with me. So I gave him. That was my so big mistake to help him. It's been my problem now, I trust everyone so early. That was a really hard lesson I learned by paying so huge and even paying right now as well.\n\n**Cyber Fraud**\n\nWhile staying at a friend's place I became a victim of Cyber Fraud. I was trying to get one big person from the bank to close all my small loans and have just one small monthly amount. At that time my CIBIL score was too good (800+). Let's not go deep into it but my last \u20b910,000 in my bank got lost in this fraud. I immediately filed a complaint with Cyber Cell but it's been a year, the case is solved but still have yet to get that \u20b910,000 back. I've spent \u20b93000 in Advocate and other stuff for this case. Every week I go to Police Station the for updates and they always say that the bank is not even opening the mail, we're reminding them every time I visit them.\n\n**Finding A New Flat**\n\nIt was a Diwali month last year. It was high time we found a place for us since people at my friend's flats had started having issues now with us living there. So I contacted that broker whom I had already given \u20b915,000. So if he can find us a new flat, we can set off that amount with his brokerage. But he didn't seem interested in finding us a good flat. I kept on calling him to return my money and he kept on giving me dates. At this point, I was relying on my friend for my food bills. Still, I had no option except to keep on finding a new flat. Just a few days before Diwali we got a good flat but the rent was too high. But we had no option. I was so frustrated with this now. Only I knew how I was arranging money to pay my monthly EMIs. Taking new loans to pay existing loans. It was hell. Now again to pay the deposit amount and advance rent, I had to take loans. I was hell-tired of taking loans for everything. There was not one thing happening right with me. I had no one to tell all these. What they would have thought about me? I was already stressed and didn't want more stress by telling anyone this. I shifted into this flat and since then we've been living here only.\n\nIn between one roommate left because of his ego and increased our rent burden even more. But lucky we found another one in the next 2 months.\n\n**Telling My Parents About My Situation**\n\nThe water was above my head. In April, for the first time, I wasn't able to pay my EMIs anyhow. All the EMIs were overdue almost by 20-25 days and I was getting threatening calls from those loan recovery agents. Every 3-5 min I get one call. I had no option except to make my phone on mute and I couldn't even attend the calls from my parents. The mental pressure was so great that I started becoming an irritating person. I never wanted to take this situation to my parents but I had no other option except to tell them. My parents even had asked me previously \"Is everything okay na?\" And I was like \"Yeah, Yeah, Everything is great.\" But then I called my dad that day and started telling him every day with my thriving hands, tears in my eyes and the voice of a crying person. I couldn't tell him everything since his voice started weakening. I was a proud son of him, he never said it but I can feel it of course. I felt like losing all my self-respect and all my respect in his eyes as I was speaking to him. I must say it was the most horrible moment of my life. I can't even imagine what my father must be thinking. \"Is his son this much idiot?\", \"Is he really failed as a father?\", and what else. I just couldn't tell him all the issues with the exact amount of my debt because it was so huge. Still the next day he arranged the amount I asked for the next morning. I immediately paid all the due amount. I foreclosed all my loans and now I had to give money to the people whom I had borrowed. There was no hurry in giving them back since they were close once and somewhat they knew what I was going through. But god did not agree to give me mental peace. I had left with \u20b95000 and I started trading in crypto since I was good at it. I turned 50 $ USDT into 150+ $USDT. I was happy that things had started working in my favour but no, it was just an illusion only. I was owing around \u20b920,000 to him and he urgently asked for it from me. I said to him okay, I'll arrange it by tonight. Since I already had \u20b915,000 in crypto, I just needed to arrange another \u20b95000 only. But when I opened my Trust Wallet app to sell those crypto, I saw that it wasn't there. Yes was stolen. Somebody stole it, man. My mind got blank, there were no emotions in my brain, I wanted to scream WHY GOD, WHY ALWAYS ME? I wanted to CRY but I got no tears in my eyes. I called my friend and asked to know if it was urgent or what. And he said he needed it by tonight anyhow. So again I was left with no other option except taking another loan. :(\n\nThis is it guys, I just can't type more. I don't know how long I've been writing.\n\nI don't know where my life is going. I wanted to write in a more detailed manner but I just can't, The stress I'm having currently is way beyond anyone can even imagine.\n\nI do have an income source that gives me around \u20b915,000 a month. But with that, I can old manage my expenses, not EMIs. I badly need one big loan using which I can pay off my all debt and organise my debt so that I can come out of this mess. But of course that's impossible to happen now since my CIBIL is destroyed. I had started to work as a BlinkIt Delivery Boy but it didn't work either because there were many delivery boys already so the potential of your earnings decreased. Every time when I make up my mind that I'll not lose hope and I'll do it, this shall too pass. That every time something crazy hits my life and ruined everything. I want to learn Web3 Development but the amount of pressure I have is just way beyond my capabilities of handling it. I can't focus on anything. My family thinks I'm doing a good job and thinking to buy a flat here. Crazy right, yeah, that's my life. I have no idea how I'm gonna come out of this mess but I've self-belief that I'll come out of it for sure. I don't know why I'm been able to manage this much pressure. Whatever setback I have, next month I find myself telling that alright god, one more, but I'll come out of this and when I do, there will be no look back. I've a dream of owning and running hedge fund in India. I'm really sorry for losing from my track in the end. I'm just writing whatever comes to my mind.\n\nIs there any saviour who can take me out of this hell? I don't know how to beg. I've never learned that. But people of Reddit, I don't want to lose in life. I want to make parents proud. I just wanted to share this and I did. I'm not even sure how many people will even read till the end and even don't know whether am I allowed to post something like this on this sub or not.","2424":"Ordered food on train from Eatsure.

So I thought I'll go to Dmart and get the boxes. So I went in the evening but I could only find two boxes there, both were opened and empty. Then I went to Ondoor store, they didn't have any. Then I went to Bazaar on dwaar, again no luck. Then I went to a bakery, they had it stock but couldn't provide a bill with gst number so I had to come empty handed. Then I went to Vishal mega Mart but they also didn't have any boxes.\n\nSo I came back home and thought I'll get the boxes delivered online via Instamart or blinkit but both apps were showing out of stock for my home location and office location. So I thought ok, I'll get the chocolates from another dmart tomorrow while going to office.\n\nBut when I went there at around 8:30 am, they said they'll open at 10 am. The dmart near my house opens at 8 am but this one open a bit late. Again no luck. So I thought I'll reach office and searched for another supermarket near my office. There was one reliance fresh which was a bit further from office but I thought what the heck. So I went there, there was one box but I needed more. So I came out empty handed and then went to another Vishal mega Mart in opposite direction. Again no luck, I didn't enter, from the outside only they showed me one small fridge with a few chocolates. Then I went further down the road to a sweet shop to try my luck but they only had sweet boxes. Finally I went to Reliance Smart. They were separating bad bananas from good ones. I asked and my prayer was finally answered. I took the boxes and finally went to office and decided to never volunteer for any event in future. Had poha jalebi on the way to office and finally reached office. But only 6 people joined the event out of 26, that too they kept going in and out of conference room.

Out of approximately 87,000 DNS queries, a staggering 64,000 were blocked by Pihole\u2014that's about 74%! Now, here's the kicker: nearly 40,000 of these blocked attempts were trying to reach Clevertap's domains, with another 10,000 gunning for Wizrocket's domains (which, for those unaware, are essentially the same entity since Wizrocket rebranded to Clevertap).\n\nFor those not in the loop, Clevertap is a tracking and marketing juggernaut commonly used by apps in India. They're in the business of journey orchestration. In layman's terms, they take your data from multiple sources, track your digital footprint, and coax you into purchasing from their clientele, which includes names like Zomato and Blinkit. What I need to figure out next is which other apps are in league with these services.\n\nWhile I get that these companies need to make their dough, the privacy laws in India are still playing catch-up, leaving consumers exposed in this data collection Wild West. The volume of requests Clevertap generates is staggering, and the impact this has on data consumption and device battery life is nothing short of egregious.\n\nTo combat this, I've set up Pihole to block these intruders network-wide. Furthermore, for when I'm out and about, I've configured Wireguard and Pivpn. This setup allows me to connect to my home Pihole via VPN and use it as an exit node, shielding me from these data vultures no matter where I roam.\n\nI'm genuinely taken aback by the sheer excessiveness of these queries. It's high time we sparked a discussion on this topic and sent a clear message to these corporations: We demand a stop to the relentless data collection and its misuse.\n\nHere are some screenshots from my Pihole dashboard highlighting the gravity of the situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hsp8o1n2okdc1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=262bb34e3c30e77e55a8461ddb8262bf3e8347f6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/54b01or3okdc1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3bdfe4f8da69a3c4d43bea4868566c2b5144f6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this, folks? Have you had similar experiences? Let's talk about what steps we can take to safeguard our digital privacy.","2708":"I believe the following **disclaimer** is necessary given how people are and the nature of this question\/discussion\/rant. This is not to judge you if you don't hold the views in question - a lot of people (most?) think they're being personally judged when being told about a point of view that they don't hold. So don't attack me if you are triggered - attack my arguments, by all means, if you can explain why they are wrong.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's the **TLDR** version - **Rather than looking down upon folks with kids, realise that it is YOU for whom having a kid is either unaffordable (financially) or untenable (due to mental health, lack of work life-balance, or other reasons), and that the problem doesn't lie with folks who do want to have kids.**\n\nHaving a child, or children, is supposed to be the biggest joy in any person's life. We are biologically programmed to be so. But when I look around at my peers and friends in India, about half of them want to be child-free, and not only that, they tend to look down on people who do want to have kids. And I'm not talking about people who are not financially well off - I'm talking about people who earn upwards of INR 50L annually, each of the partners individually, so the annual household income is >1 Cr. And it's not just my friends as well - look around this group itself, how many people mention in posts and comments, proudly too, that they choose and want to be childless. The reasons may vary - for some it's the cost of upbringing a child; for some others it's due to childhood trauma, so they don't want to even remotely inflict the same shit on their offsprings; and for some others yet, it is plain nihilism, like \"this inane existence ends with me, I won't extend my bloodline simply to subject them to this shitty existence we call life\". As a result, **they inculcate this feeling that not having a child is the moral, or intellectually superior, thing to do, instead of seeing the situation for what it really is - you are not having a child because it is unaffordable and unsustainable for YOU,** perhaps because of the way things are in your life which is a combination of societal constructs, mental health issues, income inequality and a host of other reasons. But the point to realise is, **you** ***would have*** **wanted a child and a family**, as has pretty much everybody for 99% of human history, **if your situation was good** (whatever that means in your life or context).\n\nThis is mostly for affluent folks who look down on want-to-be parents, and not for people who genuinely can't financially afford to have kids. You in India have most facilities as good as, if not sometimes better than (hello UPI) and more affordable than the West. You have a higher standard of life in some sense with your maids and house helps, and instant services like blinkit and what not, than people in the West. Yet, you can't afford to raise a child? For generations, it has been the default - everybody (barring infertile couples and few exceptions of course) had children. Yet in my generation - the millennials - people are choosing to forego this most precious, joyous and fulfilling of experiences that is parenthood, despite their lives being objectively better by every measurable metric than the previous ones. And not only that, you look to validate and justify your choices by looking down on people who want to be parents?\n\nA lot of these couples adopt dog(s) and\/or cat(s), and say that its the same as having a kid and that they don't have time to raise a child due to their careers. We live to work, not work to live - nobody on their deathbed says \"I wish I could have worked more\", or \"I wish I could have held a higher position at my company\", or \"I wish I was able to make more money\" - what they do wish is to have their loved ones, grandkids and extended family by their side. It's like, what would you do by amassing wealth in a booming economy by focusing on your career and being childless at the end of it? Live alone with your cat or dog? I love dogs too - I've mourned the death of two of my dogs - but believe me, they don't even come close to comparing with having your own kids. **And let's be honest here, the reason you have a dog or a cat is that you don't have to work nearly as hard with them and they are expendable or replaceable, in the sense that you KNOW that it won't hurt nearly as bad as if you were to lose your human child.** So its a \"low risk\" endeavour. And if you've never had your own kid(s), you can't say that it is the same, because how would you know? **So, instead, just be honest and say the truth, that you don't want to have kids because you don't want to make the sacrifices necessary (losing sleep, cutting down on impromptu vacations, and having an easy and chill life).** But you don't have a right to mock people who are willing to make those sacrifices and work hard at raising children. But then, I guess if you accept that, it makes you look bad and you can't have that.\n\nLook, I'm not going to sit and here and lecture you things like once you hit 40 or 50 or 60 years of age (different for different people), you'll - statistically speaking - begin to regret not having a child, and that fulfilment at older age comes from family; that's your choice if you want to live like that. But realise that it is not a \"better\" life choice than people who have or want to have kids. Realise that if starting a family is unaffordable and unfeasible for you - be it for financial reasons or lack of work-life-balance or childhood trauma or plain nihilism and disillusionment due to society and a misplaced value system that fucked up your mental health - then it just means that **you** are in an unhappy and stressful place. And realise that want-to-parents have either managed to overcome those challenges, or never had these problems in the first place, or want to want to have kids regardless, and that doesn't make them bad people. They need our help, support and appreciation - not hate.","2709":"I recently saw the Zepto delivery boy was killed in Hit and run case in Gurgaon, he was on the way to deliver groceries nearby.

I have always had terrible experience with Amazon Fresh and hence never used to order from Amazon Fresh. Lately, I have learnt that the so called \"rush delivery\" whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by Amazon Fresh.\n\nTwice I opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs. Today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and I contacted Amazon, I later learnt that all these so called \"rush deliveries\" are handled by Amazon Fresh. I then realized why they were getting delayed. Amazon Fresh has always been crap since Day 1. The worst part is they won't even let you cancel an Amazon Fresh order even if it has not been dispatched. \n\nSo if you are ordering something from Amazon, **never choose any of the time slots**, your order will be then handled by Amazon Fresh and you will be sorry you chose them.\n\nAs a side note, always check the item on Blinkit before ordering from Amazon. Their SKU has expanded significantly. The order which was delayed by Amazon Fresh, I checked it on Blinkit and got it in 5 minutes. Meanwhile the original Amazon order is now more than 36 hrs. old and there is no option to cancel it on Amazon.

I waited for a week and this time they didn't even delivered my items while the app shows that all the items are delivered. When I filed a complaint, they registered the complaint for a single item that costs 121 INR. Their customer service is pathetic and of no help.\n\nThis happened with me four times.

It seems like Onam has now become a pan-Indian festival with non-mallus celebrating both the trad attire + the wonderful spread of food. It\u2019s great but then how did this happen? Perhaps during the pandemic when a large part of India got exposed to Malayalam cinema. Their movies are as rooted in their culture as it can get - you get to see the languid Kerala backwater lifestyle, the everyday banters at home and with friends, the tody shops, the rubber tree plantation and basically the life of a common man. There\u2019s no makeup, no picture perfect face. I think this did three things - 1. Open up a new wave of cheers and applause for the Mallu film industry, 2. Made Mallus embrace their own culture even more so cuz now it\u2019s part of pop-culture, 3. Arouse curiousity in others to see what this culture is about. And this is why biggies like BlinkIt and Swiggy make a big deal of their festivals cuz there\u2019s a market for it.\n\nI think the way to go about the culture wars is through soft power - like cinema cuz it\u2019s big in India.

How often to apply ice pack? \n2. How long should i apply in 1 sitting? \n3. Is ice water bath and ice pack the same? \n4. What happens if i dip my feet in ice water? \n5. Where should i apply the ice pack? \n6. Should I change the place around the sprained area when applying ice?\n7. Can i walk with sprained ankle? \n\nAnd many more frivolous question of which above 7 are just a glimpse. After she had gone, even the doctor murmured something in kannada (most likely i was on the lines of - she had so many doubts) \n\nHere I got thinking that have we come to this stage where we are loosing most simplest of the home remedies known to humankind for ages (through hit and trial and experiment). That we are not able to preserve handed down knowledge from our elders in this information and digital age. That we have become so handicapped that we need expert opinion on how to apply ice pack??\n\nI try hard not to judge people on thier lack of information (and sometimes common sense) but seeing this ~50 years lady asking so many questions just on the ice pack unnerved me to the point where I started questioning the utility of all this advancement around me (in financial services, 10min delivery, medicine etc). On one hand these things have improved life standard but on the other hand, these have made us so reliant and handicapped that if blinkit\/zepto were out of vegetables for some days, some people would probably end up eating packaged food for days without bothering themselves to go to local store and buy groceries on their own. \n\nPeople should be considered about their health and right ways of doing exercises\/posture etc. But should we be so ignorant that we are having to ask minute things to professionals? \n\nI always thought that generations of millenials and onwards would be most poor in their general knowledge and common sense (being first to be exposed to mass consumer internet, rampant googling tendencies and wide internet access because of cheap rates) but seeing a middle aged person so poorly eqipped to take care of her own health makes me worried about the future of humans.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","3043":"what should i expect in R1. plz only answer if you have given interview at Blinkit","3044":"Most of the startups I see are mostly ubers or Amazons of something, or rip offs of other tech companies, or some other bs like \"wealthtech\" or \"propertytech\".

Living with flatmates, we often face the challenge of splitting grocery bills, especially when certain items are for individual use only. Manually reviewing each order to segregate and calculate the cost of shared versus personal items, and then updating the split on Splitwise, was becoming overly tedious and time-consuming.\n\nTo address this, I wrote a script that automates the entire process. The tool scrapes order-related data from Blinkit, filters out individual items, calculates the total cost of shared groceries, and updates Splitwise accordingly to evenly split the cost among us. This automation not only saves time but also reduces the possibility of errors in manual calculations.\n\nMoreover, I believe this functionality could benefit a broader audience and am considering approaching Blinkit to discuss integrating a bulk invoice downloading feature directly into their platform. This would eliminate the need for scraping their website, ensuring a smoother and more user-friendly experience.\n\nI would appreciate your insights on how best to propose this idea to Blinkit. Do any of you have experience or suggestions on approaching companies with a proposal for enhancing their services? Any feedback or guidance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to your thoughts and suggestions!","3048":"Hi everyone, below is a list of companies which I have gathered from various sources like leetcode posts, reddit posts, glassdoor, twitter, LinkedIn posts etc.\n\nThese companies pay **12L+ base to SDE 1**s and most of them pay **23L+ base to SDE 2**s.\n\nAlso, **'good' in the title actually means good paying only**.

Some major tasks which I did was:\n\n1) Migrate the website from React Native to React, and styling from scss to Styled Components.\n\n\n2) Implemented their most used feature, the Search feature, from scratch completely alone, including SSR and CSR and debouncing and URL reloads, etc.\n\n\n3) Implemented their most visited page, the main Product page, internally known as PDP, from scratch.\n\n\n4) Implemented the Order History and Order Details components.\n\n\n5) My most favourite task as I even got to use DSA in this: Improve the initial load time of website by reducing the bundle size by dynamically loading Redux reducers.\n\n\nDespite all this, I didn't get PPO from Blinkit bcoz of a very shitty reason called \"Team Restructuring\" due to which, instead of 1 manager, I suddenly had more than 1 managers just in the last 1-2 weeks of my internship :\").\n\n\nI even got to the final Tech Round of BrowserStack internship, but then they froze hiring and didn't hire anyone.\n\nI even passed all rounds of Workspan, but then they suddenly changed the CTC from 16lpa to 6lpa after they got to know Im an intern and not a full-time, so I rejected it since I had the 12lpa offer at that time.\n\nI apologize for posting here on this sub, but I genuinely am at my wit's end on getting a job, as no matter what Im doing, it always is ruining for some weird reason. Please, if you have any job opening at your org, do try to refer me. I'll be posting my resume in the comments. Thanks!!!!!!!!","3060":"Reliance-backed delivery firm Dunzo is laying off 30% of its workforces, affecting nearly 300 people, according to sources. In January, the firm had announced letting go of 3% of its workforce, citing efforts to build efficiency into its teams.\u00a0\n\nThe delivery firm has also [reportedly](https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/tech\/startups\/dunzo-secures-funding-via-convertible-notes-lays-off-30-of-staff\/articleshow\/99277213.cms) raised $75 million through convertible notes. Of this $75 million, existing investors Google and Reliance are pumping in about $50 million, the report added.\n\nDunzo, which competes with the likes of Blinkit and Zepto, has been making efforts to trim costs as the late-stage startups continue to grapple with the so-called \u2018funding winter\u2019. It\u2019s worth noting that Dunzo [raised $240 million](https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2022\/11\/exclusive-dunzo-to-shut-down-some-dark-stores-in-ncr-and-hyderabad\/) in a round led by Reliance Retail in January last year. Previously, it raised capital from the likes of Google, Alteria Capital, and Lightrock.\n\nThe hyperlocal quick delivery startup [burnt (EBITDA loss) over Rs 176 crore](https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2022\/08\/with-high-one-time-expenses-dunzo-daily-lost-rs-230-per-order-in-h1-2022\/) in June 2022, whereas, monthly expenses translated into the company\u2019s core business (Dunzo Daily) losing Rs 230 on each order it delivered during the first half of 2022 or H1 2022.\n\nIn November 2022, the company had [shut down a few dark stores](https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2022\/11\/exclusive-dunzo-to-shut-down-some-dark-stores-in-ncr-and-hyderabad\/) in Delhi-NCR and other regions. It had also laid off 25% to 35% of its staff from dark store teams. The affected employees include people on payroll as well as contractual.\u00a0\n\nDunzo\u2019s revenue from operations grew over 2X to Rs 54.3 crore in FY22. Its [losses, however, spiked 2X](https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2022\/11\/dunzos-losses-widen-to-rs-464-cr-in-fy22-while-revenue-doubles\/) and crossed the Rs 460 crore mark. Dunzo\u2019s annual expenditure and losses closely tracked revenue growth to bloat 2X to Rs 532 crore and Rs 464 crore respectively in FY22.\n\nComing to ratios, EBITDA margin and ROCE are registered at -645.64% and -31.95%. On a unit level, Dunzo spent Rs 9.8 to earn a rupee of operating revenue in the fiscal year ending March 2022.\n\nSource:- [https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2023\/04\/reliance-backed-dunzo-lays-off-30-of-workforce\/](https:\/\/entrackr.com\/2023\/04\/reliance-backed-dunzo-lays-off-30-of-workforce\/)","3061":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2z4fwvda3yda1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a555b02374125863eac0ca0ae72d2da69df81bf","3156":"Some pricing error ig - ignore uncle chips and mustard oil \ud83d\ude02","3158":"","3159":"8 minute delivery at any point in the day.

My brother answered the door and the delivery guy asked him about the complain. Turns out Blinkit deducted Rs. 1000 from his salary on the grounds that he never delivered the order to me. I double checked to make sure I didn't accidentally select the \"didn't receive my order\" on the Blinkit automated chatbot platform. \n\nI kinda feel bad because Rs. 1000 is probably what the delivery guy earns in a day. I don't know whether to take back the complain because blinkit might not cancel the delivery guy's penalty.

He is in tech, while I am into freelancing. It has been 6 months here, and to be honest, I kind of like living here. There is so much to explore. We go cafe hopping, and I have personally explored a lot of new cuisines. The gyms here are way better than in any small city; the crowd is sophisticated, and there is easy cab access anytime, anywhere. You get good quality products even at small shops, not just in malls. Zomato, Blinkit, and Zepto make everything available at your fingertips. Places like Cyber Hub and 32 milestone are a whole different world. I like watching people at their best. Everything has its pros and cons, so we avoid going out in the rain, but otherwise, everything is totally fine, modernized, and easy to access.

New to the city and the subreddit. \n\nI've moved to the city in a massive attempt to shuffle things up in life. \n\nBackground: I am from Bombay and was educated abroad from Form 8 onwards. I ended up spending a lot of time studying and building businesses in Europe and the Middle East. \n\nA whole lot of monotony, stress and after getting my business acquired, I decided to move back to India to be \"closer\" to family. But I didn't wish to put up in Bombay in order to put some distance between me and them (we are cordial, and I'd like to be easily within reach but like my space). Deciding against Bangalore, I decided to put up home in Delhi (specifically Gurgaon). My problems are:\n\n1) I thought I'd be able to drum up some sort of social life despite having almost no links,  contacts and friends in the city. In the 6 months I've been here, I've not been able to make any steady friends or network here. People are increasingly \"inward looking\" (for lack of a better word). I've tried engaging socially through activities but people are not forthcoming (except one bloke who plays Poker with me).\n\n2) Is there a lack of cultural access within this place? Restaurants (which largely serve the same food in Gurgaon), Alcohol and Blinkit cannot be the total culture of a city.\n\n3) Am I looking in the wrong places? Should I have purchased a home in Delhi instead of Gurgaon?\n\nI'm a 30 year old who's been fairly social across continents but I'm finding it difficult to gel with people here. For context on things I like to do, I am into aviation, traveling, working out and a bit of art collection.

Am from the north, shifted from Delhi NCR last year.\n\nCons - \n1. Little to no weekend getaway options. 2-3 din ki chutti mil jaye, get so confused ki kya karein bencho.\n2. (Not a con as suggested correctly by several in comments) Far away from hometown (for people from North), have to plan and spend about 50k on travel plans alone by flight. Or if by train, be ready to spend 4-5 days on travel alone.\n3. North Indian sweets are less in options, those selling dont have the same taste. I'd almost kill for Om Sweets ki rabri rasmalai, the best desi sweet of all times period.\n4. The traffic is a nightmare, but its similar to Gurgaon, if not worse. Also brings it to a standstill after heavy rains. More of an Indian metro issue than just Hyd.\n5. Never faced any water issues in the whole North India, here, specially the new city area (Hitech city) was a barren land, so come peak summers, very significant water problem. Have to completely rely on water tankers, which adds up to rent costs.\n6. Gated society flat rent and buy rates are eye watering, much high than Delhi NSR. But there is also a positive mentioned in pros below.\n7. Ola and Uber demand far exceeds the supply. And forget Uber or Ola money. NEVER put balance in it, instead keep upi handy. Every damn auto or bike guy has a qr code ready with them. Or keep cash, but upi is of course more convenient. You have to have at least a 2-wheeler for your convenience, peak hours mein its a pain to get an auto or even a bike, public transport is very bad, old rickety lopsided buses.\n8. Flouting traffic rules is the past time of Hyderabad, go to old Hyderabad and you will see more people without helmets than with. I used to be pissed off at every wrong side, no helmet rider, but have learned to be more careful and patient myself and accept this lawlessness lol.\n\nPros - \n1. The weather is hot till May, then it starts raining cats and dogs from June so no heat till next year March. Can't imagine a single night without AC in June or July in the north.\n2. A heaven for foodies, the non veg kind specially. The biryani, the curries and the Andhra cuisine is excellent!\n3. Tha cafe and restaurant options are unlimited and varied. The cafe culture is excellent, you can go to a local cafe and enjoy talking with your friends for hours, imagine a more accessible and unpretentious Starbucks experience in almost any residential locality. \n4. Local bakeries are very nice, have a good sale so the produce is fresh. I have stopped ordering bread from Blinkit.\n5. The dhinchak dakhini hindi dialect is commonly used, and the assholery like Bangalore is not here. Yes, forcing others to learn a language (unless they themselves feel the need due to issues in communicating) by abusing Northerners in an auto cab or anywhere outside is plain assholery in my book. So you can easily live here if you know Hindi.\n6. You can wear whatever the fuck you want, 365 days a year. I have seen fully burka clad and short skirt wearing ladees in my office. And have purposefully tried to see if any men are leering at the skirt wali grills, honestly out of 10, only 1 or 2 stare, which is saying a lot, compared to the way majority would r@pe with eyes in Delhi NCR. \n7. You can eat whatever, whenever the fuck you want, no closing of meat selling businesses for whole weeks or months. People (Hindus and Muslims both) will come on street if there is any ban on buying or selling any kind of food. We love our food and the freedom to eat it.\n8. Politically, they hate BJP and Congress equally. Hate Congress, because majority Hyderabadis being BRS fanbois and Congress won from the semi urban and rural Telangana. And have heard big electricity cuts in several places in Hyd since they came to power. BJP because they see what's happening in the north and dont want it to happen in Hyderabad.\n9. Very safe city, girls can roam around in late evening without fear of eve teasing or worse.\n10. It is also a pretty clean city, not in the leagues of Indore, Chandigarh etc. but much cleaner than the whole Delhi NCR.\n11. I said gated society rent and buy rates are eye watering, but people majorly live in standalone building with ease. This is because of bare minimum crime rates. One can live with family in a standalone building with peace of mind. Cant even think of the same in Gurgaon.\n\nAll in all, this is honestly the country's best metro right now. I plan to settle completely, have my kids assimilate into the culture, learn telugu (my kids and I), and become native Hydra Baddies ASAP.","3341":"why don't we get munch nuts anymore in hyd , im searching it everywhere and i can't find it \ud83d\ude2d","3342":"I'm new to trying cigars and all, i tried two with my friends and it felt really good so i need to know what are the things i check to assure that I'm smoking a good one.

It gave me the same answers as before: \"the delivery is on its way\" or \"call the delivery partner.\" I replied that the delivery partner had been injured and that I wanted Swiggy to inquire about him. The chatbot still gave me the same computer-generated response. Finally, I found my way to speak to their customer representative through chat, but there was no option of calling them. I got connected to someone named Shweta. I repeated the same information, but the answers were the same as the chatbot's. Meanwhile, I saw the guy moving in the app. In 10 minutes, two people came to deliver my meal. To my horror, I saw the delivery partner's half-cut finger, and he had tied a handkerchief to stop the bleeding. His friend had accompanied him to deliver the order. I asked him why they had come to deliver instead of going to the hospital, and he repeated the same thing that Swiggy would charge them. I offered to take him to the hospital, but his friend told me not to worry and that he was taking him there. I was so angry at the moment. I received a notification from the Swiggy representative that my order had been delivered, as if she had solved some fucking issue. I told her about the injury and asked her to provide him with medical assistance. She responded with a generic reply of \"enjoy your order bullshit.\" She also had the audacity to ask me to rate the conversation. Finally, after two minutes, the customer representative replied with \"We will take care of him.\"  \nThis entire incident just made me realize what we have become. The people at the top of the food chain strive for excellence at the expense of those who drive this entire food chain. Our greed for excellence has made us overlook the collateral damage it creates. And yet again, this brings to the picture why labor unions and strict labor policy and implementation are required.\n\nNote: I have screenshots from the conversation.\n\nUpdate: https:\/\/twitter.com\/Xulfee_92\/status\/1650837657864519681?t=2PRT754MZ66N03btWeVBew&s=19\n\nFellow redditors advised me to escalate it to twitter. With all your help, an important issue may be brought forward to food aggregators to help them draft better policies for their delivery partners.\n\nUpdate 2\nHere's the update I received from Swiggy's escalation team late last night. Sorry, I couldn't update earlier as I was traveling. A guy from the escalation department called and politely apologized about the incident. He explained that Swiggy has an SOS feature for delivery partners to activate if they find themselves in an accident. The delivery partner had panicked and forgot about the SOS feature. The representative assured me that Swiggy will take care of the medical expenses and provide better medical care. He also informed me that the delivery partner lost around 1 litre of blood. He then apologized for the bot-like response from their customer service team and assured me that they would work on it.\n\nTwo key things that Swiggy can take away from this fiasco are:\n\nThey need to have better SOS or alternative options for the same. Majority of people who find themselves in an accident like this will not have the correct state of mind to follow a process.\n\nThey need to work on their Customer Service Representatives and verbatim. It's ironic that they have options to report delivery partner behavior but don't have something for customers to report about their well-being. I understand representatives have to follow a script, but when someone continuously reports an accident, there should be some way to overcome this.\n\nFinally, I would like Swiggy to update me and the general public on the condition of the delivery partner and inform us of the steps they have taken. I couldn't ask the Swiggy escalation guy for the delivery partner's number since I was traveling. If they can provide me with his number, we can figure out some kind of help for him.","4038":"So, I went to the VFS Mahalaxmi office recently to get my visa issued. I had all my documents. Like all of them, got my prints from Blinkit at home before leaving for the VFS office. \n\nBut, the Blinkit prints didn\u2019t have 2 pages of itinerary booking of a particular stay of my trip. \n\nI was asked to get those prints at the country\u2019s visa counter. I, by chance, saw the neighbouring counter had a printer: I asked if I can share the PDF & get the prints (I even insisted that I will pay). To which I was rudely asked to go down stairs & get a print. \n\nI go down, & am asked at the counter to send the PDF over. I do so, at the time of getting the print, the lady asks me which country I am headed to, I tell her the name, she says for my 2 pager Black&White print; I have to pay 150rupees. I was like WTF? Even New York\u2019s downtown is less expensive for prints. What kinda sorcery is this?\n\nA minor caveat: I saw an aged uncle besides me who was asked which country (he said germany) & was asked to pay 150 too. He even uttered \u201ckya kare ab majboori hai\u201d and laughed it off. Honestly, might come off \u201cprovocateur\u201d like cause to many, this might be a minor inconvenience of 150, but this just doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\n\n1. Why are they asking people which countries they are going to & charging based on that?\n\n2. Why did they charge exorbitantly for something as basic as a print? I am 99.99% certain of this that: they have colluded with or asked Blinkit to not operate \u201cprints\u201d in that area. Because let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s mahalaxmi of all places a HQ-centric office region & you are telling me they are not getting demands there compared to a remote suburb I live in?\n\nTL,DR: Prints at VFS are more expensive than downtown NYC by 100% margins? the staff is scamming multiple people daily. I wanna take some action against them cause, \u201cchalta hai\u201d \/ \u201cjaane de\u201d attitude is kinda not cool you know.

In decreasing order of wrong-doing:\n\n1. Delivery boys - zomato, zepto, blinkit, swiggy\n2. Other tradesmen - any blue collar-looking men (usually carrying tools, large duffels)\n3. Young men - college guys, young office goers, gym goers\n4. Possible family - Father-child, husband-wife\n5. Auto rickshaws\n6. 3 wheelers mini tempos\n7. Young drivers in cars\n8. Women on 2 wheels\n\n  \nThe fact that these delivery boys have taken over our streets just goes to show how much power we have given to these companies. It is very easy to track these men.

I've started to go out for work again and since the past 1 or 1\u00bd months I've been seeing alot of these delivery executives riding their bikes in such a ridiculous manner, its just sick. They won't care if you're driving a bmw or a fucking tata, the hell they wouldn't even care if you are just walking by on the side of the road wo bhadwe tumko cut marke hi jayenge. Last 2 hafte me hi inhone meri car pe left and right dono taraf scratch mar diya apne bikes se. Car toh chalo hathi hai samjh me aata hai scrath lag gaya. Bhenchod meri bike pe bhi scratches maar diye cut maarte waqt, my mom was the pillion wo bichari girte girte bachi. They won't care about red light, Orange light unke liye sab bhenchod green light hi hai, rukenge hi nahi madrachod saale, forget about normal zebra crossing, uska concept toh bhadwo ko pata bhi nahi hai. The other day i was stuck in traffic and just like a normal person i put my foot down on my bike and was standing there in a corner, this asshole \"blinkit\" delivery executive came and Rode his bike on my fucking foot. And he didn't even apologize, he just went away filtering through the traffic. I was going for an important paperwork, i couldn't go because my foot started paining so much i was not able to change gears on my bike, eventually i had to park my bike there and come back home, i sent my friend to pickup the bike later. Upar se ye madrachod swiggy, blinkit, jaise bhadwi companies ne ye \"delivery in 10 mins\" ka naya chutiyap chalu kar diya hai, iske chakkar me inke delivery executives aur buri tarah se ride karne lag gaye hai. Bhenchod i don't even think i should fully blame these delivery guys they are also living paycheck to paycheck, the hell paycheck ke naam pe jhaant ke baal mil raha in bicharo ko, they are probably making ends meet because of tips that people give them. Galti toh wo sadi gali bhadwi companies ki jinke liye ye bichare kaam karte hai. Inko jis road se jana hota hai aur agar bhagwan na kare waha pe traffic ho toh ye kutte kamine saale opposite side wali road pe wrong side se gadi chalane lag jate wo 50-60 ki speed se.

And if you go through the comments carefully you will see that Varun calls the general crowd over here as Reddit ke Gawaar and what not. He comes at everyone with a vengeance as he is just too crass and insecure himself. \nJust by selling some perfumes he feels he is some Perfume God or something. Even today he commented on something he is not aware of as if the OP is lying. \n\nSee - Screen shot\n\nOther Links here \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/YEoTvBCDTn\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/5GHABxonRF\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/2BMgR1AZLm\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DesiFragranceAddicts\/s\/jz8KuZEw0A\n\n\nImagine spending your hard earned money on buying from such people and then being subjected to abuses and name calling and personal attacks if you were to raise any query to them. \nTheir high handedness in resolving any issue is to be seen firsthand. \nJust by saying we have this certificate and we are this and that does not automatically absolve them. They feel they are too big to give any clarifications to anyone. \nHe couldnt give any proofs immediately but yes later on after being called out he will dig high and low and come up with something after begging on his other groups. \nWell in this it was a case of different packaging which I have anyways mentioned in the post but going to the extent of targeting someone\u2019s family is uncalled for. \nHe called me Buddha, Buddhe, Darpok, Chacha and mentally unstable and even going to the extent of targeting my family and  what not.

I have achieved a lot of my dreams already and yet I\u2019m still young at heart \ud83d\ude02\nBuddha hoga uska baap. \n\nSomeone even told me that he wrote in the DFA chit chat group ke \u201cyeh aaj marega mere haato\u201d.

He actually completely exposed himself in trying to be oh so cool and even some of his own supporters didn\u2019t like the way he presented himself. Think about it, there is not a single seller here who behaves in such a condescending manner. \nThe original post was due to the worry of some guy who had bought the Khamrah from Talib but Talib being the gentleman that he is,  he never once commented anything adverse on that OPs post.  \n\nYes , everyone can buy retail phir tum jaiso ki dukaan hi bandh ho jayegi. \nAajkal itti itti thaeliyo me bhi Ajmal Silver Shade milne laga hai Zepto aur Blinkit par \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd when there are many other reliable sellers still existing on this sub, you people (buyers) should be the best judge to decide whom to buy from if u don\u2019t want unwanted hassles. \n\nAnd to those saying how can there be fakes of clones, sorry to burst your bubble but they are there and in large numbers already. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/fragrancedeals\/s\/GWA47NbFfu\n\nLet me also add here that he sold Kaaf and Fattan at unbelievably low rates some time back and then (I would not say many), but some of the people did complain about watered down versions, sharp,  shrill, chemically pungent smells which must have been brushed off as bad batches or package change or whatever else.  So don\u2019t fall for his low price best offer tricks. \n\nThanks to a few of the gems from this sub for reaching out to me personally and feeling concerned about this guys obnoxious behaviour. Really appreciated and I will keep your identity safe as understand no one wants undue attention \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb \nJust that U thought about me makes me feel immense gratitude towards U. \n\nNow coming to the most important question here: Why are there no basic rules or guidelines for not making personal attacks on anyone by the mods. Why can\u2019t such egoistic clowns be barred from the community or warned to maintain decorum as is the norm in other subs on Reddit?\n\nIf general people like you and me would have degraded someone like this, then we would be kicked out the next minute. \nWhy this soft corner for this kind of rowdy sellers. Is this what this group has come to now?\n\nWhy are Mods lenient with such kind of sellers? KBC question !\n\nA) Mods don\u2019t care two hoots\nB) Mods (atleast some of them) are  his customers\nC) Mods are way too neutral to be disturbed by anything \nD) Mods are like \ud83c\udf7fkhao mast ho jao\n\nMalkeet Narula ko toa ek second me ban kar diya tha.

If you're not planning on feeding it all the meals, dry food is the cheapest and best option. Otherwise, you should mix in some wet food. If you don't plan on feeding it even a complete meal and want to let it find its own food, get treats instead. They're more tasty than dry food and easier to handle than wet food (more expensive than both). \n\nIf you want to befriend the cat, be patient. It might never be comfortable with your touch or it might let you pick it up the next day. You need to be patient and see what they're comfortable with. I've befriended both kinds and I've seen them give birth to kittens that were their complete opposite. \n\nWear gloves if you want to attempt physical contact. Unless it's vaccinated, you'd need a rabies injection as a precaution if it ever bit or scratched you. I got ~~thr~~ the stray who sleeps on my couch vaccinated, so I don't have to worry about that. Not that she has ever bitten or scratched me.\n\nEdit: And don't feed it vegetarian food. Cats are carnivores. They might eat grass for digestion, but don't feed them veg or spicy food.

Customers get attracted to the numbers which look healthy.\nAnd if you can't sell at a bakery you can try selling near the gym or yoga centres if the owner is buying product from you great otherwise you can try to be outside of gym and showcase the benefits of products they will buy.\n\nHope this helps!","Digital marketing would be good","I\u2019d suggest you stick to Amazon . \nIndia is a trust deficit society  and people trust buying from Amazon more than independent sites . \n\nAnd focus on building a social media presence and brand first . \nFirst focus on why someone would buy your product and once that is strongly established . \nWork on your usp , and see which category it is in , is it a premium product .\nIs it one of those organic , less sugar or transfat products .\nPlay on that .\nIf you crack the taste and texture and it feels like value for money , \nPeople \u2018d pay for that .\n\nYou can learn how to run ads and direct customers to Amazon . \n\nAlso see if you can work with quick delivery apps like Blinkit,Zepto , instamart .\n\nChocolates are in the wants category and people usually buy it to gift or as an impulsive spend , \nAnd quick delivery apps make it more convenient.\n\nOnce you reach a certain amount of sales , the category managers at Amazon will give you the time and guidance .","So, here\u2019s what\u2019s standing out to me - your products are clearly good (repeat customers and good reviews prove that), but it feels like you\u2019re stuck in the classic \u201cgreat product, low visibility\u201d loop. \n\nLet Amazon do more work for you. Try tweaking your product titles and descriptions with keywords people actually search for. In that price segment, gifting seems to be the only fitting category, else shift yourself to Fresh. Doing this is free, just time-consuming, but it can help your products show up higher in relevant search results.\n\nIf you can spare a bit of cash, Amazon ads might be worth a shot but tiny, hyper-focused budgets only. Target just a few keywords that match your niche, monitor them weekly, and pause anything that\u2019s wasting money. It\u2019s not a magic bullet, but it might push some extra sales your way.\n\nD2C definitely isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s doable. Instagram could be your discovery platform. Lean into reels showing how you make your chocolates or chips. People love that \u201cmade with care\u201d vibe. See what competing brands are doing, what\u2019s working for them. Partner with micro-influencers in the foodie\/health niche who\u2019ll work for free samples or a barter deal. Also, get a basic free Shopify store or even just an Instagram shop going so customers can buy directly from you (less platform fees).\n\nFor B2B, approach local cafes or gourmet stores. Your margins look decent, so offer them bulk rates where they still get to mark up your product. Shoot them an email or drop in with a sample. Cafes especially are often looking for unique, artisanal snacks to upsell.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take hustle, but you\u2019re already doing the hard part by making great products. It\u2019s about squeezing every ounce of value from what\u2019s already working and getting your brand in front of more eyeballs. \n\nI personally think your margins make B2B a smart move. Start with local cafes and bakeries, pitch your chocolate bars as premium accompaniments to coffee or your chips as upscale sides. Bring samples to owners or managers, and offer a trial batch at discounted rates to get your foot in the door.\n\nGourmet and organic stores are another solid avenue. Visit in person with a pitch highlighting the quality and unique appeal of your snacks. Position them as artisanal, small-batch products that stand out from mass-market options. Some of these stores might even take stock on a consignment basis, so you only pay once sales come through.\n\nCorporate gifting is worth exploring too. Small businesses often want unique gifts for employees or clients, especially around festive seasons. Put together a sample pack and reach out via email or LinkedIn, should work. \n\nIf you can handle bulk production, reach out to catering services or event planners who need premium snacks for weddings or corporate events. It\u2019s a different scale of sales but can drive bigger orders.\n\nI think you\u2019re in a niche market with a product market misfit. B2B will take persistence, but once you land a few steady partners, it\u2019ll ease the strain of relying solely on Amazon or D2C.\n\nHope this helps.

The large stores then were no longer needed and the brands realised it was not worth it to operate and started closing down these stores.

Plus a big part of quick commerce is picking and packing. Dark stores are designed to ensure minimum time for this. Pharmacies are not built that way.

Always always inculcate a habit of paying the full amount on or before due date, no matter what.

With the introduction of India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, CleverTap has been proactive in addressing the new data privacy landscape in India.\n\nThe DPDP Act, 2023, requires explicit consent for the use of personal data, purposeful use of data with timely deletion post-usage, robust data protection measures, transparency about data use, compliance with cross-border data transfer restrictions, and special considerations for children's data privacy. In light of this, CleverTap has highlighted the importance of these measures and the necessity for brands to adapt to these requirements, ensuring a commitment to privacy compliance and enhanced trust with customers.\n\nCleverTap emphasizes their commitment to securing user data and maintaining privacy. They offer a choice of hosting locations globally, including Indian data centers, to comply with local governance requirements. This is crucial for businesses that need to adhere to specific legal or governance mandates regarding where their data is stored. As a safeguard, CleverTap stores all data in localized AWS instances and follows best practices to ensure data is protected, including encryption of data at rest.\n\nIn terms of compliance, CleverTap has met globally-recognized standards such as GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA, which are assessed by independent, third-party auditors. These compliances reflect their dedication to adhering to rigorous data handling practices and data transfer regulations. Internal controls like two-factor authentication, role-based access, restricted IP access, and campaign approval workflows further limit data access, providing reassurance that data is accessible only by authorized users.\n\nThe company\u2019s broader perspective on user consent and data privacy is that trust is foundational for business relationships, and this trust hinges on responsible data practices. CleverTap encourages businesses to create a shared responsibility model, prioritize user privacy in their product development, and actively engage in thought leadership around data protection.\n\nCleverTap\u2019s parent company, WizRocket Inc., reiterates their stance on not selling, sharing, renting, re-marketing, or using publisher data for any purpose outside the publisher\u2019s intent. They ensure that data collected by publishers is governed by the publisher\u2019s privacy policy, highlighting their role as a service provider rather than a data controller.","Pihole zindabad.

Why do major parts of India who were exposed to Hindi cinema early on adopted the language so easily even if they all had different regional languages & different mother tongue. South India didn't, because they had their own huge industries","I'm a malayalee born and raised in Bangalore. For a lot of my formative years, I studied in convent schools that would've had about 10-20% of kannadigas. Therefore, given that majority of the kids in my school and other schools were of people from all over, we would end up watching English \/ Hindi content. I could read and write kannada because I was taught in school,however I had no cultural anchor to the language. \n\nGrowing up, I made a lot more kannadiga friends but they'd end up watching the same movies and shows that I did. Of course there were probably a few exceptional works of art that came out, but they're either restricted to arthouse films or somehow fail to appeal to the hoi polloi. \nThe problem, I think, is multi pronged. \n\n1) Most of the \"popular\" kannada culture, food and language come from the same few regions of south and coastal Karnataka( dosas,literary giants, movies). There are hardly any famous representations or depictions of places from North Karnataka or kalyana Karnataka. Even if there are popular representations, they're far and few in between. This could a reason as to why there hasn't been cultural waves of late. This wasn't as stark in the earlier part of 50's and 60's but it is quite visible now. \n\n2) There are comparatively lower kannadiga migrants in other parts of India than other states. You're far more likely to find malayalees in Calcutta or Delhi than you are to find kannadigas. This means that a lot of the population here either immigrate to other countries or stay within Karnataka. This means that since there isn't much propagation of the kannadiga culture in other states, people who have lived there have never probably experienced facets of the culture. Therefore, when people land up here they really have no hook or incentive to learn the language or feel part of the culture. If I were to go to Kolkata, I have a fair idea about at least some aspects of their culture;be it food, movies or language. This context will then help me integrate into the community.\n\n3) People treat Bangalore as a transit city. If one's been or lived in Dubai, you'll find a ton of people remark how they don't intend to make a life there but rather, it's a pitstop for a while. A lot of people look at Bangalore as a place you have to be to work, not a place you want to be. This means that since people think they're anyways here only for a few years, why bother with anything else. A sense of ownership is lacking which probably is worse here than in cities like Chennai or Mumbai. The locals feel that they only take and not give back to the city.\n\nSo, probably propagation of kannada culture in other cities and states  by carefully selecting and curating content, creating other peripheral cities(like faridabad) and creating a sense of ownership amongst people who are in transit here would probably help.\n\nPs: This is not a local vs outsiders debate. Each side is both right and wrong from their own standpoints. The objective is to have a dialogue.","I agree. Soft culture of karnataka is in shambles when it comes to promotion. We need to blame our own people for that.","I\u2019m a Kannada-knowing south-Indian.\u00a0\n\nThe only way to get the non-natives to learn Kannada is to make sure Kannada elites don\u2019t abandon it and very importantly, not hand over the responsibility of Kannada \u201cprotection\u201d to the masses and the subalterns.\u00a0\n\nFor a long time, Bollywood movies focused a lot on maintaining aesthetics. Look at the family dramas, for example. It\u2019s always something surrounding an upper class family where everyone is well-dressed, well-groomed, have good body language, speak in an urbane, sophisticated manner, and so on. No over the top bullshit except when delivering emotional dialogues.\u00a0\n\nSouthern movies, on the other hand, were always about the subalterns. The \u201chero\u201d of the movies (which is a very subaltern way to refer to the lead actor) is almost always an unkempt, greasy looking ugly middle-aged dude who speaks like he was brought up in the slums, has subaltern mannerisms, speaks the language like an uneducated person.\u00a0\n\nWorst of all are the over the top fight scenes with feral, animalistic face expressions for depicting anger. Compare the angry faces of Shah Rukh Khan from the 90s and some southern \u201cmass\u201d actor. The latter will make you puke.\u00a0\n\nThankfully, southern movies of late have upped their game with aesthetics, so it might seem more \u201cclassy\u201d to associate oneself with the culture of your native culture is something else.\u00a0","\nYeah, the larger point made makes sense. But at the same time I don\u2019t believe the Kannada film industry is as good at the Malayalam film industry with respect to the stories being told. There is the odd movie striking and well adopted by the nation. But it seems to be the exception and not the norm.","This is the way to go OP. Cinema, theatre, music, dance, books, etc. Using these people will make people fall for the language, the culture. If you force something on someone, you will face opposition, but if you make something they like, people will come on their own.\nAll the hardline groups seems to be missing this, they only know to raise their voices, thrash public property.              \nI'm a non-kannadiga but I watched KGF 1, 2 and Kantara in Kannada, understanding the language and throughly enjoying the movie.","Not just cinema, you also need series, non-cinema linked music, and anime. By consuming different modes of content, I have learnt a bit of language and culture of Korean, Japanese, and recently Spanish. These industries and add to it English of course, I have come to realise how lacking we are in quality entertainment industry.","Yes, Cinema can be huge promoter for the local culture and festivals. I've seen youngsters celebrating Halloween and brands having black Friday sales in India - All these are started because of pop-culture influence.\n\nI'm from Kerala and I've been living in Bangalore since last 4 years. I only know a little about the culture and festivals in Karnataka. The only Karnataka specific festival I know is Yugadi\/Ugadi ( correct me, If I'm wrong). I get to know about this through indirect methods like there will be people buying mango leaves from market and there also a state wide holiday for that day. I've got Kannadiga friends who work at  Karnataka Chithrakala Parishadh and Science Gallery Bangalore - through them I heard about the rich culture and history of Bangalore. The sad part is, AFAIK, none of these are not popular among the common folks of Bangalore.\n\nAs an outsider - I've only seen less than 10 Kannada movies ( Lucia, Kirik Party, Charlie 777, Sapta Sagaradaache Ello , Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana and of course KGF). IMO, Kannada film industry should focus on making films with good content.\n\nOne more thing - I used to hate Leo Messi while I was in school. Why? Because of there was huge fan of Messi in my class and he was an a\\*\\*hole. Those days I hated the days where Barcelona won any matches or Messi scored some goals. The sole reason was I had to tolerate that guy. After school, I lost contact with that guy and started loving Messi. So, If there is some big misunderstanding or judgement towards a community that they hate outsiders, People won't be interested to learn more about that community and their culture.\n\nPS: Regarding Onam, It is the only festival in Kerala which is not tied to any religion or caste. I think every community or region should have some festivals like this ( Bal Gangadhar Tilak tried to do this with Ganesh Chaturthi and people failed him).","Not sure if this is the right post to ask this on, but can someone give me a list of a few good kannada movies to watch? \n\nMy definition of \"good\" is movies which are not over-the-top in terms of action or facial expressions, have good direction, and great plots. I don't like \"grandeur\" in movies, or even the overused plot of \"hero does the unimaginable for love\" trope, which a lot of Indian movies try to focus on for some reason. \n\nLastly, my preferred genres (but not limited to) in movies are either drama, crime thriller, or psychological thriller.\n\nA few movies I can give you as examples would be \n\nEnglish - Shutter Island, 12 angry men, etc.\n\nHindi - Kahaani, Andhadhun, etc.\n\nBengali - Baishe srabon, any of the Byomkesh movies, etc.","Yes and yessssssssssssss.

This causes delivery times to go up.\n2. Bunching many orders to save costs on fleet size. This again causes delivery times to go up.\n3. Asking extra money if bunching isn't opted by customers.\n4.

Average activa\/Dio mileage comes to 2-2.5rs per litre. That's including idling in traffic. \n\nNow for each delivery it costs on average 15rs fuel. \n\nNow add one way routes. And the cost reaches 20rs+ if they go for that long u turn.\n\nEach order takes 15 minutes on average. Round trip time. So earnings is 10rs per order.\n\nBlinkit had 15rs base pay one point. Do the math for that on your own. \n\nNow who among you is willing to work for 40rs per hour? 400rs per day? If you work for 10hours. \n\nLet's say bike tyres get punctured and once a week repair and maintenance cost. \n\nI know a bunch of people who used to work for zepto, blinkit, Swiggy, Zomato. \n\nI work in logistics and I see lots of riders joining us and they all have similar stories. \n\nIn the beginning these companies used to pay 50-60 and even 80rs for 3km order but now it got lower. Blinkit had strikes last month because of base pay reduction. \n\nOur company pays 18rs per order but they get 80+ packages  and they have to cover on average 20km\/day. Hardly costs them  50rs fuel per day. We also pay fuel allowances. Imagine Ekart, Amazon, shadowfax, Delhivery etc. \n\nNow the problem is these grocery and food startups are using e-commerce delivery pricing as base and justifying their nonsense. They still don't make profits. \n\n\nSolution????\n\nThey need a minimum order value of 500rs+ to be able to pay 50rs for the delivery partner. And still they won't make a profit. It'll just balance to net zero. So the only way to help the delivery agent is to order for more. \n\nif you want to help try ordering for 700-800rs+ all the time. And maybe these companies will be able to afford to pay drivers. And you will see normal driving on roads by delivery agents. \n\nBig basket has been a bit ethical on the 30 min delivery business.

Being a low-income country, folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too in-disciplined to adopt productivity apps (let alone pay subscription fees for them!). Furthermore, if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is - people spend hours in local trains & buses. It is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments (Instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports, betting apps, etc. looking for instant gratification or 'quick' money). Neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps.\n\nTo summarize: Low-income population + Indiscipline + Poor public transportation\/infrastructure --> Instant gratification apps (such as betting, gaming apps).","[deleted]"],"3053":[">Namaste!\nThanks for submitting to r\/developersIndia.

Mostly by end of day 1 in events you will come to know the target shops, and work in commission of daily sales not the upfront amount directly. Study about fashion, jewellery, tech, gadgets, is minimal and repetitive. Worst case you get 2500 , try to target atleast 3 such host places.\n\n\n2.

Rather than cutting their losses, Zomato is throwing more good money into bad investments. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how market reacts tomorrow.","Oh, look! A money losing company is absorbing another (much faster money losing) company to cover its losses..","RATIONALE:\n\n1. Strategic perspective \/ qualitative reasoning: Too many unknowns in any M&A (and this isn't an 'M'. Rarely do any true mergers happen, as one party always has an upper hand); Blinkit has been bleeding money, much like most QCommerce players globally.\n\n\n\n2. Financial perspective \/ quantitative reasoning: M&A worth ~$800M, means that Zomato has to issue $800M worth of new shares. It's an all-stock deal. Ab Deepinder Bhai apni jeb se toh nahi denge na? \n\n\nWe all know that issuing new shares will dilute current shareholders' holding in % terms. This will logically lead to a decline in share price, because each individual share is worth lesser than it was before the merger.\n\n\nNow this is NOT ALWAYS TRUE, because sometimes the company being acquired will add more EPS. If the EPS vs. dilution math works out, the future value discounted to present day will give you a higher 'fair' price.\n\nHowever, in this case, I doubt this will happen because BlinkIt themselves have a terrible EPS.","Blinklit is grofers right?","I have a new theory about this, op please share your thoughts on how much it might be true.\n\n\nIn the last few years venture capital funds have invested in a lot of startups because of stock market boom and as the rally has been fizzled out now its time to move the money from risky assets to safe assets. To take out the money invested in startups ipo is the way but even ipo is not a good path because of current situation and profitability of company. The solution to this problem is merge with a company which is already listed, as venture capital funds of both companies are same they don't have any problem in merger. After the merger, in exchange of startup shares you will be getting listed company shares which can be sold in the market and get out of indian market. As they are  FPI\/FII they are investing for development of india by increasing startups indian government is so thankful to them they offer them lowest tax rate possible or even better if you are based in mauritius you don't have to pay any tax.","Isn\u2019t that a positive news?","I think it's good news, better than investing 400 mn $ hard cash that Zomato was planning to invest in blinkit (reported around feb).","Isn't this good news?","All i can say is food delivery will live on. #fatfuture"],"3787":["Aur ye sab start ups milke hamare Portfolio ko Cheer denge...

I had hoped to see some constructive reviews and meaningful experiences today, being Sunday. Unfortunately, yet again, we\u2019re met with another Alibaba vs Varun debate. Allow me to clarify several points for you and for the community at large:\n\n1.\tRegarding the authenticity of the perfume: \n\nWas the perfume fake? NO. Were you scammed? NO. All accusations regarding the bottle\u2019s authenticity were thoroughly addressed, and you yourself acknowledged that it was indeed a legitimate product.\n\n2.\tSeller verification on the DFA subreddit:\n\n\t\u2022\tNo seller is officially verified or labeled as \u201ctrusted\u201d by the DFA moderation team.\n\t\u2022\tThe rules clearly state that we do not maintain a list of verified sellers, nor do we endorse or authenticate any sellers or their stock.\n\t\u2022\tAny lists shared within the subreddit are community-driven, created by members to provide a general understanding of grey-market sellers. These are not officially backed or endorsed by DFA in any capacity.\n\n3.\tYour transaction and its aftermath:\n\n\t\u2022\tYour deal was conducted outside the subreddit, and your disputes with the seller also occurred outside the subreddit. This makes it a private matter between you and the seller.\n\t\u2022\tDespite this, you have attempted to involve the moderators, questioning why we haven\u2019t taken action against the seller for their offensive language. However, I\u2019ve observed inflammatory remarks from both sides in this case. Additionally, comments such as \u201cMods ke friends hoge sellers\u201d are baseless and inappropriate.\n\n4.\tActions taken by the moderators:\n\n\t\u2022\tA stern warning was issued to the seller regarding their use of abusive language, with the explicit consequence of a ban for any further violations.\n\t\u2022\tSince this warning, we have not encountered any hateful or abusive comments from the seller\u2019s side.\n\n5.\tRepetitive nature of your posts:\n\n\t\u2022\tThis is now the third or fourth post regarding the same incident, which occurred months ago. Rehashing the event repeatedly and turning every weekly thread into a rant adds no value to the community.\n\n6.\tUnacceptable behavior from both sides:\n\n\t\u2022\tWhile I agree that the seller\u2019s language was inappropriate, your own words were equally unacceptable. Disputes and arguments should be confined to private messages. Bringing these disputes into the public forum, engaging in mutual abuse, and then blaming the moderators for inaction displays a flawed understanding of our role.\n\n7.\tConclusion:\n\n\t\u2022\tThere is no evidence of a scam, no sale of fake products, and no history of fraudulent or unfulfilled orders involving this seller. As such, a ban is unwarranted.\n\n\t\u2022\tHowever, abusive or threatening behavior will not be tolerated. The issue was addressed, and corrective action was taken when the seller was warned. Since then, no further issues have arisen.\n\t\u2022\tConstantly revisiting the matter and creating unnecessary drama benefits no one.\n\t\n8.\tFinal clarification:\n\n\t\u2022\tDFA does not maintain any verified or trusted seller list. All purchases are at your own discretion and risk.\n\t\u2022\tThe moderation team does not guarantee the behavior, professionalism, language use, nature, personality or stock authenticity of any seller. If you value peace of mind, it\u2019s advisable to stick to retail purchases.\n\nI hope this clears up any misunderstandings. Let\u2019s keep this subreddit constructive and focused on our shared passion for fragrances.","Irrespective of what has happened, no one has the right to abuse anyone. It seems like the mods here are biased towards sellers. Sellers hold more influence in the groups, which might be why this happens. The same applies to Facebook groups like FMI. Moderators should address misbehavior and permanently block those who act inappropriately. Let this group thrive without bias. Peace out!","wtf is this pathetic language \"Teri idhr bhi Marana chalu karu\" ??\n\n  \nwho the hell is this seller?
