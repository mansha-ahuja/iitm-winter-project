have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","1":"i made an order of around 400 and now its saying theres rainfall in your area theyre not delivering my order its been more than an hour and its not even raining\n\nand to top all that theres no way to contact the customer support in the app no way to talk to any agent theres no option to even chat\n\ni am so pissed right now i dont know what to do","3":"hey everyone\n\nim putting together a list of great product companies in india that offer a good worklife balance and good pay i found this nice list by umadaoest posted 3 years back but im wondering if its still

some of you have suggested moving this list to a git repository or a page i plan to do that once the list is more complete  \n\n   right now its easier for people to comment and give feedback here which helps me update it quickly\n\n2 worklife balance is subjective  \n   i know that everyones experience with worklife balance can be different  \n\n   my goal is to show a general idea of a companys culture based on feedback from the community this way it gives others some guidance even though it might not apply to every individual\n\n3 about adding new companies  \n   someone pointed out that i had added zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers thanks for that  \n\n   now im checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still verifying their hiring status\n\n4 focus on experienced professionals  \n   this list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference it can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures\n\n\nedit\n\nsorting it alphabetically so that it is

would be really helpful for my analysis","13":"cannot see a stop or unsubscribe option anywhere how do i stop it","14":"so recently tried zepto for the first time because of their steel deal offer for new users il admit the superfast delivery was a nice surprise and the referral bonuses make it worth a try if youre just getting started\nthat said the app still feels like its missing a few basics sorting through items can be a bit clunky and\nnoticed some essential products arent even listed its great for quick deliveries but feel like they could improve the variety and app organization to make it a smoother experience\nanyone else tried it what do you think","15":"","16":"time is 148 am right now and i decided to order some snacks while watching inception this was my first time ordering with zepto so i got a free premium pass with this order resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know i can send him money over through gpay but i dont know i am skeptical of everyone ever

introduced me to their partner today they are running some kind of business the reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners\n\nthey set up a meeting at chaayos park square mall first a person came to meet meher partnerand explained that the senior partner a lady would come to meet me to see if i have the vision and mindset for the business and if im likeminded enough to partner\n\nthe lady boss came for a general introduction she didnt say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better she asked why i wanted to do business my plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life she responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere and i insisted on not missing the monetary benefits she asked why i hadnt started earlier and i said i didnt have a clear idea to start with and didnt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case then she talked about the mindset of zeptos founders a food delivery app and how they succeeded even after dropping out i called her out saying she was wrong and corrected her by saying zepto is a food delivery app she responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect\n\ni asked about the business and she said i wouldnt be able to fully understand it then she explained that they are in b2b ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to make my decision and have the money ready and once im in the business i would understand it fully she added that if it were on the internet or so public everyone would be doing this we are exclusive and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a partner we need to know each other and the business well i cant understand anything without being inside the business she said \n\nthis friend is more of an acquaintance and i dont know a lot about her how we met is an interesting story but it doesnt add any context here\n\nthe job requires 23 hours a day done digitally that friend bought a car recently and quit her fulltime job as well\n\nsounds like an mlm scheme or scam to me but is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it what is this business how does it operate is it legitimate\n\ni said no to join because i cant be part of anything i dont fully understand and its not public or on

these apps are banking on us paying for convenience but wheres the accountability is this fair would love to hear your thoughts and any advice","25":"hey guys this is my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"recently a zepto employee admitted to the widespread use of dark patterns in their app revealing strategies designed to extract more money from customers among these tactics the app allegedly charges customers with phones priced over 30000 more than others effectively using devicebased discrimination to increase revenue\n\nthis isnt an isolated case flipkart was recently in the news for charging iphone users more than android users for the same product similarly urban company faced backlash in 2022 for preselecting premium services leading customers to unknowingly pay extra\n\ndark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users consumers can protect themselves by reviewing charges comparing prices and reporting such practices have you faced similar issues","30":"like if im buying a cadbury the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps and i would get all the prices  that are there along with minimum order price to get free delivery this would save effort in using 4 or more different apps to check where i get the best deal","31":"","33":"i was a daily user of zepto for the last two months and i even bought their monthly pass which offers free delivery on orders above rs 100 however things started getting ridiculous after this point for every order they charge an extra rs 10 as a platform and handling fee regardless of whether youre a pass user or a normal user \n\nmoreover they made free delivery an optional feature if you dont manually apply for free delivery theyll charge you with these tactics they keep charging money and i find it absurd as a pass user free delivery should be automatically applied but you must tap on the free delivery option each time this can be easily missed when youre in a rush or if kids are placing orders \n\nnow lets talk about grocery fruits and vegetable prices out of all the platforms zepto is the most expensive especially for fruits and vegetables compared to offline stores sometimes the price differences are double for example if yelleki bananas cost rs 50kg in the offline market theyll be priced at rs 100 on zepto the same applies to watermelon and other fruits even daily essentials like potatoes and onions have higher prices\n\nthese apps also encourage you to spend more once you become a pass member by showing extra discounts when you make a minimum purchase of rs 300 as a result most of your orders exceed rs 300 and you end up buying unnecessary items\n\ntheir main goal is to increase the average order value aov and daily user count to achieve profitability which they aim to do through these pass and discounted price strategies\n\ni understand the convenience and comfort of getting groceries delivered home but it comes at the cost of paying higher than market rates\n\nin my experience you can save up to 30 monthly by not using this app\n\nim not against online shopping or ecommerce i frequently use them in my experience big basket is better for savings if you plan weekly shopping for fruits and vegetables local stores are a more affordable option","35":"\n\nhi guys i created a website where you can compare the prices of multiple emarts like blinkit instamart zepto bigbasket and

prefer kiwi yes bank credit card over its two competitors i know tata neu infinity gives kiwi a close fight and im including jupiter edge csb here just because i have itthe card is a flyweight today no pun intended\n\nwhy not jupiter edge csb or tata neu infinity  \njupiter edge csb has been a poor choice for a while now ever since it was devalued it is ltf though gives 2 back on upi spends only on one category which can be changed quarterly but even that too can be a hit and a miss i was barely getting any cashback only advantage was free credit period also unless you have a jupiter savings account federal bank you cant convert jewels their rewards into real cash most often you get 04\n\non tata neu infinity earnings are decent 15 but you get stuck with neu points rather than real cashback neu coins can only be used on tata platforms like big basket1mg tata neu also has limits on upi earnings max 500 neucoins per calendar month also tata neu infinity is normally a paid card and today only new users to hdfc bank can get it ltf under a special festive offer existing hdfc cardholders cant this has been communicated to multiple people on this sub recently hdfc bank has refused to make my fyf tata neu infinity ltf which means i will close it before renewal as i dont see enough value to justify the rs 1499  gst renewal fee\n\ncoming to kiwi yes bank credit card\n\n 2  5 real cashback on scan  pay cashback is directly transferred to bank account when i redeem no closed or proprietary wallet like tata neu and kiwi also transfers to any bank account unlike jupiter\n base reward rates are 4 kiwis on upi spends  1 cashback and 2 kiwis on nonupi spends  05 cashback users can subscribe to neon for additional cashback and lounge vouchers\n first year neon subscription is free for applications till dec 31 2024 this is optional and user has to optin can opt out year 2 onwards\n under neon users get\n\n 2 cashback on upi transactions and 050 cashback on nonupi transactions  \n 3 cashback and 1 domestic airport lounge access voucher on spends of  rs 50000 in a year  \n 4 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends of  rs 1 lakh in a year  \n 5 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends  rs 15 lakh in a year\n\nwhen you cross rs 50000 in spends upi and nonupi you get 3 on all upi spends before milestone was reached so 1 extra on transactions where earlier 2 was given same when you reach other milestones\n\n minimum transaction value to earn cashback is rs50\n maximum cashback in a calendar month is up to 1 of credit limit which is plenty compared to tata neu infinity\n the card is ltf\n kiwi app has great ui and ux the tata neu app is very poor on ui and ux jupiter is fairly good though kiwi is the best of the lot\n both upi and nonupi transactions are considered for calculating milestones with the kiwi yes bank credit card\n kiwi yes bank credit card is also eligible for yes bank credit cards instant discount offers eg on amazon swiggy etc\n kiwi has separate discount offers on platforms like swiggy zepto zomato etc so you get yes bank offers  kiwi offers\n excluded categories for base cashback  milestone fuel jewellery wallet load insurance education rent utilities telecom government payments tv cable services and emi transactions\n the icing on the cake for me has been the surprise cashback i get on regular upi spends via bank not credit card done on the kiwi app small amounts but certainly welcome\n\nnegatives\n\n i didnt get cashback on 1 or 2 merchant spends till date have got kiwis on 99 of transactions\n is great for only one year if neon is not offered free next year as base cashback is only 1 however in my experience most upi credit cards are short lived before they implode in a devaluation and i expect there will some new upi credit cards next year super moneys supercard plus looking at you is expected soon and headlines are 3 cashback on all upi scan and pay spends and an ltf card to boot","37":"\nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar ","38":"\nive been in the tech field for the past three years and ive noticed some posts in the community claiming that tech is too expensive and unaffordable however the truth is quite the opposite\n\nwith the evolution of hybrid frameworks like flutter and react native developing an app has become much more affordable if youre a hardworking student or intern who dedicates 5 to 6 hours a day you can have your app ready within a month with a budget of just 5000 to 10000\n\nwhen it comes to servers there are already free options available for the first year setting them up has become incredibly simple these days take heroku for examplejust one command and your server is up and running\n\nif you find a good tech person who can manage resources efficiently you can complete your app website or server within a budget of 20000 in a span of 2 to 3 months\n\nim referring specifically to small feature applications like zepto\n\n\nthis is for people who doesnt have funding ","39":"is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by default when its applicable \n\nzepto used to waive the delivery fee by default until recently theyve

bag enabled i found myself buying all groceries from them super quick deliveries \n\ntime for renewal of membership still some bucks  though technically it had tripled now i think prices were still low but higher than earlier deliveries still fast but slower than earlier the app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here not what you want to learn from your competition looking at you swiggy still good\n\nnow theyve gotten really sneaky with their pricing a few things are still on discounted rates but most arent but the real sneaky part is where they dont show the split of the prices anymore you need to go look for it and heres the best part you need to now enable free delivery sneaky buggers guess much like the other delivery apps this too will be just another option \n\ndont know if they would be able to sustain what are your thoughts and experiences with the app do you think itll be much like the countless food spots that pop up every other day and are gone in a few months here in kochi","44":"placed an order with dunzo  took more than 2 hours to deliver stating theres no delivery partner  unable to cancel cause the app said the order is processed  tried to communicate with them but its a one way communication with a bot which they did not even reply later  \nalso i realised after that i could get the same order in zepto for a way lesser price which i later did and they were at least very responsive over the chat although there was a slight delay which i completely understand cause of the delay \n\npoint is  their customer service sucks and they should atleast give us an option to cancel the order is they cannot deliver it within the promised time ","45":"hi guys\n\ni am launching a new venture to help d2c brands offer

head he wishes me merry christmas and asks for a selfie also maybe they need to upload on the app so that the company can track if the christmas theme idea that they had in mind gets applied on ground level also \n\nit made my day sadly it was a prepaid order or i would have told the guy is this my christmas present santa\n\nanyone else got santa delivery partner","48":"tldr 1015 lpa intern opportunity no experience needed yes i am not kidding scroll through the post and you will get it\n\n  \n  \nfirst of all if you want to get serious in life i have a lifechanging opportunity for you\n\nonly condition is are you willing to put the hard work and stay consistent \n\n\n\nthis post could be the life changing for you might be long\n\n\n\nto give you some context \n\ni am an integral part of an amazing startup i wont name it here but i can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn to give you a brief idea about us we are a delivery startup \n\nyou might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories \n\n\n\nknows about native app development \n\nwell assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week if you complete it within the timeframe well start your stipend\n\n\n\ndoesnt know about app development \n\neven if you dont know anything about app development but youre a determined individual who wants to achieve something then you are welcome in our startup\n\nwe are ready to invest in

with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\nthis opportunity is open to everyone even if youve just started your first year of college doesnt matter were looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work\n\n\n\nfuture plans \n\n\n\nif you stick with us well continue paying your stipend and once we have full confidence in your work after 46 months well hire you directly within a year you could be earning at least \n\n10 lpa and if you show extraordinary skills 15 lpa i know offering this package during this period of time of recession is rare but were committed\n\n\n\nso if youre ready to join us feel free to dm me well set up a google meet and take it from there\n\n","49":"tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber","50":"is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by default when its applicable \n\nzepto used to waive the delivery fee by the default until recently theyve started giving an option to

can be made into a huge business because there is a huge demand for it i have planned the supple chain recruitment the cashflows delivery and almost all aspects of this business \n\nthe only thing i am stuck at is the tech part i need an app but i have limited knowledge about creating and mostly about maintaining the app \n\ni dont want to make an app by a third partywhich is very easy  not

flair or sub for this \n \nedit no they didnt take my phone but who knows dont be like me \n\nmyntra delivery guys are asking to show myntra feedback form which you receive in your mail which rates myntra services and then giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it \n\nwhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver itll be given separately they are saying no its from the same form when explained that delivery rating is separate from myntra rating theyre unable to explain themselves and saying no its the same its not \n\n\nif youre ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them right it has happened with me several times with even zomato instamart zepto etc \n\nso i thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback but the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of myntra not the delivery executive \n\nhe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail i told him i wont because i do not want to rate myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and thats all they should care about \n\nplease dont give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service if yes tell them you can do that on app and dont let them rate it for you \n","54":"so i used zepto only because a friend referred it to me and till this day ive never used it except to spend zepto cash on something i really need essentials only\n\nand i spend it very carefully i used to get almost 125 daily for a few days then it reduced to 75 so i buy only the stuff that is zepto cash eligible i used it once for the 25 promo and 125 to almost get a free delivery and only buy stuff where im making minimum cutoff amount of 99 and spending the bare minimum \n\ni once just tried to fill the cart with i may or may not need and saw this surge fee where the code leaked not a coder so if someone can make sense of it lemme know ofc i deleted most items later to not spend on it\n\ni dont have their stupid pass subscription because they just want you to activate it to show the investors so i intentionally decline it every time only to see a 1 difference so i just dont buy it \n\ni also dont need any paper bags i have plenty but since im keen on zepto failing like another byjus i specifically untick it to add the bag to my already existing pile of bags\n\ni only order essentials where zepto looses money and use the free cash to pay for it \n\ntill date in a total of 10 orders ive not paid anything more than a total for 200300 max that too because i had friends at home once so yeah a net order spend of 25\n\nso yeah if you hate zepto and really want to see it fail id suggest you follow this strategy\n\ni mean ofc this case is an exception and not the general crowd is like this but i thought ill just put it out in the open for once\n\nand yeah if you want 25 off on your next order upto 200 let me know lol ill send the referral link to you on dm ofc i get something similar too but upto 800 which im sure i wont spend on the app so yeah idk i just want to watch zepto burn\n\nwhy so much hate because i want the vcs behind zepto to realise that burning money isnt gonna get you anywhere principles of business stay the same youre trying to cash out on a greater fool theory only to dump it to dumb retail investors and please your silent partners its sort of an ego thing of forcing zepto to make money by burning money and making aadit a puppet just stop doing this and be real for once","57":"is it true for some reason the app wont install on my phone atm i hope its true gonna be such a lifesaver","58":"i know this sub doesnt really love co branded credit cards much but this ones been quite spoken about especially as a travel credit card due to it having 0 forex charge and good lounge access while being offered ltf for now\n\ngot this card in around march primarily because i had a foreign visit and also because i needed lounge access getting it was an easy process though i also had to send them a mail from my work account for verification the total process took 5 business days including vkyc and the card was delivered soon to my permanent address unfortunately they dont accept rent agreement as current address proof so i had to proceed with the card being delivered to my permanent address\n\ncoming to the usage of the card itself when i got a card there were a lot of au bank credit card offers on apps like zomato  zepto though now i dont see them anymore i was also able to use the international lounge in t2 bengaluru airport with it i also did some transactions in pounds  aed and they really were 0 forex with no dcc dynamic currency conversion applied i have

bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people

things started getting unfolded\n\ni opted not to debate with the rider as he was just doing what he was asked to do \nbut its blinkit which still need otp for delivery person to enter on silver gold

shoes forgot milk for your coffee bam its at your door midnight froyo craving done its like glamping for your grocery shoppingconvenient but kinda extra\n\nheres the tea\n\nthe pros aka awesomesauce moments\n\n1 convenience supreme need it now you got it no more lastminute dashes to the store\n\n\n2 techie vibes the whole dark store concept and how it all runs like clockwork is kinda fascinating\n\n\n3 staycation ready perfect for days when youre too lazy to even think about leaving the house\n\n\n\nthe cons aka sideeye material\n\n1 crowded space everyone and their dog seems to be launching a qcommerce app the competition is wild\n\n\n2 labor drama the rush to deliver in 10 minutes not so fun for the folks on bikes or scooters braving traffic\n\n\n3 impulse traps did i need that second round of snacks nope but here we are\n\n\n\nits cool and all but im wondering if this is just another hellacious trend in the retail race or something thats actually here to stay plus with everyone jumping in it feels like the market is a little overcrowded\n\nwhat do yall think is qcommerce your goto lifesaver or does it make you wanna photobomb its hype lets hash it out","88":"i want to order these two things but as they are not available in a single store zepto is charging 30 rupees as delivery\n \ni mean its not my concern if they arent available in a single location its available in the app so its on zepto to deliver the products and show them as a single order \n\nif its swiggyzomato then its understandable that i want to order from different places and thus ill pay the extra delivery fee but for zeptoblinkit etc its their headache to make the things available in one single place\n\nplease let me know if my opinion is wrong","89":"\nyesterday i had the honor of discovering zeptos unique interpretation of time you see they promised me a 5minute deliverya magical feat that could make even amazon prime blush i placed my order imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials reality a solid 1520 varna minutes later for the uninitiated varna time works like dog yearsmultiply by three my order finally arrived\n\nthinking this was a oneoff glitch i reached out to zeptos customer service big mistake heres how that went\n\t1\tcustomer service attempt 1 were trying to contact the rider\ntranslation weve lost the rider please send thoughts and prayers\n\t2\tcustomer service attempt 2 the rider went to the wrong location\ntranslation our gps works about as well as our delivery times\n\t3\tcustomer service attempt 3 crickets\ntranslation weve decided to ghost you\n\nto add insult to injury the apps order history mysteriously stopped loadingeverything else worked fine but not the one feature i needed coincidence i think not\n\ndetermined to validate my experience i ran a little experiment today same order same 5minute promise result a 35minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport meanwhile blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutesand actually deliver within that timeframe shocking i know\n\nso dear zepto is this your new business strategy lure us in with false promises frustrate us with disappearing riders and then leave us questioning our life choices if so its working brilliantly\n\nscreenshots enclosed because sometimes you just need receipts to cope both are 15

gett too many recommendations and ads from uni card one card sbi cashback card etc what do you guys think is the best for me \n","92":"i am inspired by applications like zepto blinkit swiggy zomato  flipkart and many other app which allows the app icons to change dynamically i would like to do the same but i need some guidance on how to implement this or if there are any available packages for that or do i need to set this functionality by writing native code and method channels  \n  \ni came across these resourced be none of them seemed to be working   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","93":"help us to

day so i kept it like that but whn i open today each and every fruit is damaged and i dont even have a option to send them back like we used to do in a stores so guys if you are planning to buy a

suppose everybody does so after 15 long mins of waiting finally it reaches a point where its out for delivery after 5 to 7 mins roughly the order showed delivered i instantly called the delivery person and guess what hes not answering after 2 attempts i called zomato cs and surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the delivery guy as soon its out for delivery got the food this time still i didnt got my money back yet zomato\n\nive also used blinkit swiggy eatclub

eu for few years  settled in us for 2 deacdes  but still travel globally every week including visits to india every month  so i observe  compare these markets very closely\n\nindia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017 the digital currency ondc  several transformational initiatives stock market is riding high on the modi wave  so is inflation  purchasing power  rupee valuations may be on purpose  has gone down  drastically cost of a good meal is same or higher in india compared to useu  but income isnt comparable\n\ni keep seeing lots of startups coming up  but none are able to succeed on a global platform  several are acquired by west backed competition   most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west \n\nexcept a lenskart  zoho  bookmyshow  a few more handful none of them have succeeded in global arena why is that if the product was good it should have  right   i understand some business need not go global  but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nubers amazons were  able to penetrate indian markets  eat local share  but a ola or flipkart hasnt gone global \nzomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses  oyo has acquired lot of properties  but they just loss making properties  are still in losses  \n\nwith the largest pie of it engineers in the world  we havent had a single appproduct thats globally used we have only been a consumer market with 12  of world population  biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\ni remember using flipkart in the beginning once  the website design  layout itself were a mimic of amazon forget the business model  i had doubts if they will succeed  but ended up being sold for billions \n\nmama earth is a rip off of babyganics including its branding   green colors but its valued at 5000 cr \n\nwe keep seeing lots of half baked products on indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr  \n\nthere was a lot of vc funding coming  so valuation game was on  but lately foreign vc funding  has dried up  as most investments are yielding profits  exits are just based in hype based valuations\n\nzepto is a great example  how a company with no unique ip is valued so much  already people are claiming its model is a failure   not scalable those 2 young kids dont have the same charm or intellect that we saw in gates or jobs when they were young lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nthe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success  whereas in india we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nbut how long will this circus last  only till vc funds dry up or when nririch indians stop pumping into this game \n\n i am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for

industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in

a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on september 15th the uk was the first international market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing

The person who was supposed to take the interviews didn't show up and not once but thrice in three different time slots\ud83e\udd37.\n\nAfter the third No-show I told the HR to get their business in order first and then think of anything else.\n\nI guess I should be thanking him now \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit: with the post going so viral, I feel like posting all the screenshots that I have. These are the follow up messages I sent, the non -conclusive responses from HR and the non attended calls \ud83d\ude05","1":"It happened to me around a week ago, I was a little free so I went directly to their store which is nearby to me. Made some new friends, learned how Zepto works and stopped using Zepto all together. Sorry for you OP\nAnd they constantly keep shoving the zepto pass in your ass.\nI stopped using zepto when they sent clearly rotten vegetables twice and refused to give me a refund. All they said was a generic \"We will ensure this does not happen in the future\". Deleted my account and uninstalled the app. Zepto was the first fast delivery app but man have they gone to the gutter.\nZepto customer care teams are the worst. I have ordered two items and one chocolate bar was missing when the item reached home. I contacted the support and they asked me to send the picture of the package lol. How can I send the picture of the missing item?!!! Then they said that the item was there when it was delivered it seems. Also the item was packed too. I argued that there can be a chance that the delivery guy must have taken it. They denied that as well. They said they won\u2019t issue the refund. I deleted the app right away.\nSame here. They delivered a wrong variant of a product and i am trying to return it but their customer support is shit. Nothing is working on their customer support side. Stopped ordering from zepto and uninstalled the app. Bigbasket, Instamart and blinkit are far better.","3":">Namaste!\nThanks for submitting to r\/developersIndia.

However, work-life balance (WLB) can be quite debatable, even within the same company\u2014it varies by division and team. Ultimately, it depends on your manager.\n\nFor example, I worked at a company where my team had excellent WLB. We didn\u2019t have to take late-night calls with our U.S. counterparts or work weekends. Meanwhile, another team right next to us, working on a different project, often had late-night calls and occasionally worked weekends.\nDeath due to work - All Big 4 !!\nFlipkart good WLB \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nAdobe is a joke.

Segregation, recycling, disposal, etc. Otherwise you're just creating a landfill.\nIf govt sees you're earning more than them on a certain place they have a control, *knock knock*, you've got some company \n\n\nEither they'll pass laws outlawing you or get you to bribe heavy\nBiggest pain point for me personally is... I work night shift. I can't wakeup early morning to dispose waste to the government collectors. I can't leave it out for them to collect because animals might spil it. I will use the garbage collection model especially for time.\nBut starting it out as a startup, I believe you will get a lot of challenges from government side because I read somewhere Bangalore municipality is looking at the similar model to implement in the upcoming years. So getting approvals maybe hard. But if you can elaborate more on what you will do after collecting waste like how environmental friendly your model will be maybe make you stand out from government model. You will have an working app that's a plus as well.\nYou\u2019re forced to pay a shitload of taxes in every big city to the municipality every year. It is the job of the government to come to your home personally and do the garbage collection everyday. Some activism from citizens in the local BBMP office should work. And you can thank the workers by giving them some monetary allowance during Dasara\/Deepawali every year.\nTrust me, people will rather throw the garbage in the roads instead of paying anything.","6":">Namaste!\nThanks for submitting to r\/developersIndia.

The closest shop is a 15 min walk. Couldn't walk it. I really appreciated having access to a service like Blinkit then.  \n\nThat said, I really hope people are using it only when going out is not feasible.

They deliberately use non-standard product quantities like 450g\/900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg, making comparisons harder for customers. Additionally, they push customers into purchasing VIP memberships by showcasing misleading discounts, which are actually deducted from the membership amount, creating a false sense of savings. Even their cow milk, which used to come in 500ml packs, has been reduced to 450ml for new customers. These practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust.

You get almost unlimited 5% on major brands which you would be using on a very frequent basis. The 1499 renewal is justified for some users maybe, but even I am not one of those. However, having a big purchase once in a while can give you actually good rewards in Neucoins which definitely can be used at a lot of places. \n\nAs far as Jupiter is concerned, never used it nor I like the idea of having to switch. I can't plan my life according to a card spend pattern!\n\nKiwi hands down give the best user experience and the most ease for UPI transactions and the fact it is LTF makes it so rewarding in conjunction to any card which give on a average more benefits in all types of spends!\nReally liking Kiwi UPI. I was using Coral rupay from ICICI which is completely useless.\nMost of my UPI spends are in small Kirana stores or street vendors, who generally have their personal account's QR instead of a Merchant account, or rent to the house owner personal account. Wherever CC is accepted I pay via CC. Just thinking about getting Kiwi for the Rupay CC, primarily to clean up my bank statement of these low value upi transactions. Not sure if it will work or makes sense in my case due to the case mentioned above.\nGot my Kiwi card and first statement generated.\n\nMy finding,\n\n1. They charge 5.9% on fuel spends, so don't use it for fuel. For 200rs they charged 11.80rs, Previously did one fuel transaction with icici coral rupay no additional charge was included.\n2. After receiving 500 kiwis I'm not getting any cashback, af far I know 2% of your credit limit is the maximum cashback you can get, so my credit limit is 25k it means 500rs is my limit but after 132rs around 542 Kiwi i haven't received any kiwis for 5-6 payments.\n3. Op you get flat 2% cashback on scan and pay not on all UPI spends\n\n\nAnyone Interested in applying for Kiwi card I can share you my referral link\n\n\nForgot to mention kiwi app gives you additional 20% discount in Zomato and swiggy upto 100rs minimum txn value of 399\nOne downside I have been facing with CC on UPI is acceptance. Many merchants have disabled CC payments via UPI because they are being charged MDR. I guess things will only get worse with time,  given that the govt is now reducing incentives on their digital payment push. \n\nI am not sure when, but eventually NPCI will also require to charge MDR on UPI. Maybe for spends beyond a certain value.","37":"Good analysis. Zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience. After burning the VC capital. There would be no more discounts. Than, only dmart would be able to provide at MRP or below MRP purely due to it's scale and margins. Quick commerce can never provide below MRP without VC capital.\nOkay. \nA few points. Zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the VC Money to figure out the following \n1) Dark store penetration and expansion. In areas where dark stores aren't profitable ie Minimum order value on a daily basis that's where the VC MONEY handle the loss\n2) the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms. \n3) cost of delivery \n4) Marketing and ads to promote the platform (but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands)\n\nThey DO NOT PAY for the discounts. NOT ONE CENT\n\nThere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category.  But usually they don't. \n\nI have worked in KAM roles in multiple brands. The model is simple. If I have a product A who's MRP is say 100 rs. \nI pay zepto a fix margin. So 30% (norm. It's higher for blinkit). So they pay me only 70rs. So i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nSo take case of discounts. They put it for say 80rs. So instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer. So they balance it 100-80 = 20. They raise a debit note agaisnt it. And the brand has to pay it back.\n\nNot only that. The banners. The placement on top of search for keyword search. Everything is monetized. \n\nSo zeptos net profit is = margin from brands(30%avg) + Banners and marketing placements - cost of dark stores and delivery -tech cost - any marketing (ads and extra coupons)\n\nSo the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter. Blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs (new brands are asked for as high as 55%) and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs. Also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low.\n\nHave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions. But most discounts are borne at the source.\nQuick commerce is made for the growing riches in india, while India will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class, Dmart and Zepto both are not going anywere I think (only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth)\nPeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators. Look where we are now. Food for thought?\nHow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years? Brosky India has infinite cheap labour, it\u2019ll become profitable sooner or later.","38":"\"Tech\"?? Buddy say software. Hardware costs crores to build.\n>I\u2019ve been in the tech field for the past three years\n\nAnd you have learnt nothing....\n\nYou have apparently no idea about scaling an app to handle a million concurrent users trying to login at the same time.\nBro move ahead from \u201cSide Projects\u201d, good software takes time, experience and money\nBuilding an app is very easy\n\nBuilding an app that actually works well in the real world is tough\nI disagree with most of the things in the post. \nBut I agree with Tech and tech building tools have gotten better and faster and cheaper. \nBut you are down playing the effort that is needed to build software products. \nI develop apps and websites so it is a little personal to me, sorry for the bias.\nSo, things have gotten cheap yes. \n5-10 thousand is the rate you pay for unskilled labour or you exploit hardworking and talented students. If you do that or encourage that, shame on you. \nThere will be a noticeable difference in quality of a 20k app developed in three months by a \"hardworking\" intern vs what is done with actual resources who work in the field. \nRates are insane and the margin is insane too, agreed but that is for big players who churn out quality product and give quality support etc.\nYou seem to have a very superficial understanding of how things work here even after 3 years, so I am assuming you are from Sales and not get involved in the technical execution part more often. My advice is to talk to more freelancers, firms and even interns, compare their work vs what they charge, then you will understand where all that extra money goes.","39":"Yes, that's really scummy of them. You now have to 'apply' free delivery with Zepto pass.\nRecently, Zomato had an offer where a free burger was given on orders above 600.\n\nI was alone, so I called my friend and we placed an order for 600. However, we did not receive the extra burger.\n\nUpon checking the cart, we noticed that there was a tick box that needed to be ticked in order to avail the offer \ud83d\ude11\nThese apps are unprofitable and have to resort to such practices in desperation. \n\nMaybe design a better business model that's actually sustainable lol.\nInstamart> Blinkit> Zepto , Follow this, Instamart is good, Blinkit has a lot of products and Zepto only if you need something which is unavailable on both the apps.\nI even tweeted this tagging them - they simply asked to DM my details and then ignored","41":"I uninstalled Zepto for this very reason. It should be applied automatically.\nDark patterns these are called.\nHeard they are using kochi as some testing ground for their features as they are relatively new here and the user base is lower than other regions.\nI really reduce my dependance on online Grocery and food delivery apps as much as I can unless I am in a tight situation...\nEven though this didnot happen to me other than once,but the app is so laggy and smtimes the cart price and their price seems 10-20rs diff even making me count it manually","44":"Dunzo is finished.. Don't use it.\nMy money stuck in dunzo since January 2024 with no delivery assigned ever. And no refund. Its a total scam.\nI think there should be a PSA to not use Dunzo anymore.

They have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues. So the ICICI Amazon Pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping. \n\nHDFC Millennia and Swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and I just got SBI Cashback on top of it, so there's no reason to even look at a Flipkart branded card.\n\nAlso the Supercoin shit seems confusing, I seem to earn them but can't redeem them? The Swiggy Card's reward is much better for Swiggy anyway, so using that for Swiggy is a waste.\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part SBI employees might be watching this\nI would counter your perspective on groceries. Although prices on Flipkart are always less, the variety is minimum. The available options nowhere come near BigBasket or Blinkit. And the obvious that Flipkart doesn't have Quick Commerce, so BB or Blinkit wins there.\n\nMy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours. No Myntra and Nykaa, but almost 4k worth of medicines either from PharmEasy or 1Mg.\n\nFor Amazon ICICI, non-prime members get 3% cb.\n\nThe spending criteria doesn't make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh+ only on one CC for all 12 months.\n\nSo neither Flipkart Axis nor APay ICICI comes close to SBI CB.\nSBI CB and Flipkart Axis both have their own use cases. You like Flipkart Axis over SBI CB because you make substantial purchase on Flipkart.\nFlipkart Axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart. So yes, Flipkart Axis is good enough on Flipkart website but that's about it. SBI CB shines everywhere. If someone's purchase isn't substantial enough on Flipkart then Flipkart Axis is pointless for that person and SBI CB make more sense. Your post looks more like a marketing for Flipkart Ecom than comparing Flipkart Axis with other cards side by side.\nI see this more often for people holding Amazon Pay ICICI credit card, they pretend like it is some really amazing card but it's not. Apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as Flipkart Axis. These both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective Ecom.","50":"They prey on the negligence of the people \ud83e\udd21.\nNot zepto user but if there are limited free delivery on pass then this button is valid else they are just trying to loot extra money\nIt's a common dark pattern found in videogames that have predatory practices.

Moreover it's not tech only, it's ops heavy.

And I'm happy to pay extra for the convenience if my order on Zepto is more expensive than me going to buy it in the store. Because I value my time more than I value the few rupees.

For example take Arun. \nWhy Indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity, Once SRK said this \u201cgurbat me creativity nahi hoti\u201d meaning there\u2019s no creativeness when you\u2019re poor, and I personally believe it\u2019s the reason. You see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background. Other thing I believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture. A mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person. \nTimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade. \nPeople are now accepting Entrepreneurship is something in India but still we have a long way to go.\nIndia is kind of late to the technology scene. I remember, in 1997-1998 there used to be to 1-2 computer hardware shops in Nehru Place. While in US, dotcom scene was so booming, which eventually led to the bubble in 2000. We were so far apart. \n\nYou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 10-20 years. Our startup scene only started in around 2007. It takes a good 10-15 years to build a solid foundation. Yes, we lag behind & will continue to lag behind USA but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less. There are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news, which is good actually-\n\nGrey Orange, Pine Labs, Postman, ChargeBee, Rivigo .. and so on.\nZoho is an outlier currently. Another 5-10 years more and we'll have more Indian startups that'll be used globally.\nI think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success. As you mentioned, in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that. \n\nTake Zerodha for example, they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a value-added product. \n\nAnother example would be FInshots (Ditto Insurance), which started off with making finance accessible to the layman, currently working towards making insurance available to everyone, excellent product, and excellent founders, going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight.\n\nI'm sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game, which will organically shine when their time comes.\nThe current startup scene in India, fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for \"unicorn\" status, is  misguided. It fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy, often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class. Zomato, Byju's, and Swiggy are classic examples.\n\nPerhaps a more sustainable approach would be for India to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets. As Peter Thiel emphasizes in his book \"Zero to One,\" true startups should focus on creating something entirely new, not just replicating existing models. Zoho and Zerodha are commendable examples of Indian companies that have done just that.\n\nIndia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, with a higher proportion of self-employed individuals than perhaps any other nation (except maybe China). Government and investors should have prioritized established, homegrown successes like Naga Mills, Haldirams, and Everest. These companies, admired internationally for filling genuine gaps, represent India's true entrepreneurial strength. Instead, the focus seems to be on loss-making ventures like Ola and Swiggy, businesses arguably unsuited to the Indian market's current needs. \n\nPerhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging India is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population. By fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs, India can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, not just a select few.\n\nY'all stop being copy cats...","122":"Tag the CEO Aadit Palicha and Co founder Kaivalya Vohra on Twitter","123":"All the hyerlocal delivery have zero support, I tried Zepto and Blinkit.

Being a low-income country, folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too in-disciplined to adopt productivity apps (let alone pay subscription fees for them!). Furthermore, if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is - people spend hours in local trains & buses. It is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments (Instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports, betting apps, etc. looking for instant gratification or 'quick' money). Neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps.\n\nTo summarize: Low-income population + Indiscipline + Poor public transportation\/infrastructure --> Instant gratification apps (such as betting, gaming apps).\n[deleted]","127":"I swear I expected better from Zepto tbh","129":"Swiggy HDFC Card for Swiggy; Amazon ICICI Card for Amazon; Amex for the rest and burn the Coral - shit card","132":"Did you find a solution?","133":"I thought foxtale only had a new.

I plan to do that once the list is more complete.  \n\n   Right now, it\u2019s easier for people to comment and give feedback here, which helps me update it quickly.\n\n2. **Work-life balance is subjective:**  \n   I know that everyone\u2019s experience with work-life balance can be different.  \n\n   My goal is to show a general idea of a company\u2019s culture based on feedback from the community. This way, it gives others some guidance, even though it might not apply to every individual.\n\n3. **About adding new companies:**  \n   Someone pointed out that I had added Zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers. Thanks for that!  \n\n   Now, I\u2019m checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list. If your suggested company isn\u2019t on the list yet, it\u2019s because I\u2019m still verifying their hiring status.\n\n4. **Focus on experienced professionals:**  \n   This list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals, but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference. It can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures.\n\n\nEdit:-\n\nSorting it Alphabetically so that it is easier to find company names\nChanging Low Paying to Mid Paying\n\nChanges made so far \n- Removed VMWare\n- Moved Broadcom from Low Paying good WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Twitter\n- Moved Ola from Unknown WLB to mid paying bad WLB\n- Moved Browserstack from Unknown WLB to Remote First\n- Moved Rippling from Unknown WLB to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Zepto to High Paying Bad WLB\n- Added SAP Labs to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved ServiceNow from Unknown WLB to High paying Good WLB\n- Moved RedHat from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Good WLB\n- Moved Cred from Unknown WLB to Mid paying Bad WLB\n- Added MathWorks to Good Paying Good WLB\n- Added Akamai to Remote First\n- Added MasterCard to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Smallcase to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved BigBasket from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Grab from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Moved Gojek from Unknown Compensation to High Paying Unknown WLB\n- Added HashedIn to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Walmart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Flipkart from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Zeta to Mid Paying Bad WLB\n- Added Phonepe to High paying Good WLB\n- Removed Zerodha from the list\n- Added Autodesk to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Unacademy from Unknown WLB to Bad WLB\n- Added Agoda Bangkok to Visa Sponsorship outside US\n- Added Zoho to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Added Freshworks to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Atlassian from Good WLB to Bad WLB\n- Moved Directi from high paying Unknown WLB to Mid Paying Good WLB\n- Moved Datadog from Remote first to mid paying good WLB\n- Added Confluent to Remote first ","4":"How to Protect Yourself from Dark Patterns in Apps (Zepto, Myntra, Blinkit, Zomato, Ola, Uber, Rapido)  Dark patterns in apps are becoming increasingly common. These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns. By using a budget device, you might avoid being flagged as a high-value target.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: This is especially helpful for users in the age range of Gen Z, as they're frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns.

Time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app, he greeted me with \"Radhe radhe\" and i greeted him back, the order was prepaid. So, he takes out my order, making small talk and being very polite, talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever(?), then he apologized for taking so long (he didn't) and calling so often for directions wagera(he didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons) I didn't know what was coming and I just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why he's so enthusiastic about it. He said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks \"Actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h, budget toght h rasin vi nai h\", I was thinking to myself 'why wouldn't he just give me my order, he's just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture' and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me \"My dad passed away a year ago\" he said with a slight tremble in his voice, \"I am having to provide for the whole family and I am not being able to, if you could, please help me out, I promise I will return you the money next week\" he said, now completely in tears and I dont know what to do, I am terrible in those situations and I just want to take my order and get back to watching Inception, I feel sorry for the guy but I dont have shit on me, I am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and I only ordered those snacks because I have only had 2 meals in 2 days, I finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and I'm gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home (but that's a different story), I cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week, even my dad died a little more than a year ago, I can relate to his pain, and if he is really telling the truth then I cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a Delivery boy. \n\nSo anyways, he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house, and I told him that I dont have any money on me and that I can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops, but he insisted that I check my gpay to see if I have some money, I dont need to check, I have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money I'm offering him, but he just kept asking for more than just 30, 40rs and I had had it with him, I told him I am sorry but I cant help him out, that I am also in a crappy situation in life right now, that I couldn't help him out even if I wanted to and finally he said its okay, he wiped his tears, \"radhe radhe\", handed me my order and then I left.\n\nThis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and I checked to see if there's a tipping option on Zepto but I couldn't find it.

One of my friends introduced me to their partner today (they are running some kind of business). The reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners.\n\nThey set up a meeting at Chaayos, Park Square Mall. First, a person came to meet me\u2014her partner\u2014and explained that the senior partner, a lady, would come to meet me to see if I have the vision and mindset for the business and if I\u2019m like-minded enough to partner.\n\nThe lady boss came for a general introduction. She didn\u2019t say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better. She asked why I wanted to do business. My plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life. She responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere, and I insisted on not missing the monetary benefits. She asked why I hadn\u2019t started earlier, and I said I didn\u2019t have a clear idea to start with and didn\u2019t want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case. Then she talked about the mindset of Zepto\u2019s founders, a food delivery app, and how they succeeded even after dropping out. I called her out, saying she was wrong, and corrected her by saying Zepto is a food delivery app. She responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect.\n\nI asked about the business, and she said I wouldn\u2019t be able to fully understand it. Then she explained that they are in B2B e-commerce. They would set up my virtual distributor shop, and I would get distributorship rights for big corporations, selling to retailers. I would have 10-14% margins shared with all the partners. They work in collaboration, so if any other partner makes a sale, I get my share. I would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop.\n\nThere are two requirements: I have to make a quick decision and invest 4.5 lakhs. That 4.5 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop.\n\nI asked follow-up questions, and she said she couldn\u2019t tell me more about the business. Once I say yes and share my documents for verification, she would tell me more, and I would need to have the money ready. She said that once I get into the business, I would fully understand it.\n\nI asked if I wanted to know more, is there a website or something I could read on. She said no, we are protected, and there is nothing on the internet. I asked her to send me at least some documents to read, and she said she had already told me everything required. She said I need to make my decision and have the money ready, and once I\u2019m in the business, I would understand it fully. She added that if it were on the internet or so public, everyone would be doing this. We are exclusive and protected.\n\nI had a heated discussion, and she left, asking me to make the decision and inform my friends. Then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner. I said that as a partner, we need to know each other and the business well. I can\u2019t understand anything without being inside the business, she said. \n\nThis friend is more of an acquaintance, and I don\u2019t know a lot about her. How we met is an interesting story, but it doesn\u2019t add any context here.\n\nThe job requires 2-3 hours a day, done digitally. That friend bought a car recently and quit her full-time job as well.\n\nSounds like an MLM scheme or scam to me. But is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it? What is this business, how does it operate? Is it legitimate?\n\nI said no to join because I can\u2019t be part of anything I don\u2019t fully understand, and it\u2019s not public or on the internet\u2014anything protected and very private is a red flag for me, and I can\u2019t put the money in it blindly.\n\nOne more thing, they kept calling each other sir\/ma\u2019am even though they are colleagues.","24":"Are Apps Like Blinkit and Zepto Scamming Us with Missing Items and No Returns? I've been using apps like Blinkit and Zepto for their super-fast 20-minute deliveries, but I've noticed a major issue: there's no option to return or replace items if something is damaged or missing.\n\nI recently had a product arrive incomplete, and neither the delivery person nor the app's support was helpful. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you deal with it?\n\nIt seems like these apps are banking on us paying for convenience, but where's the accountability? Is this fair? Would love to hear your thoughts and any advice.","25":"Best off-ramp (crypto withdrawal) options for India - My experience Hey guys, this is my first post here although I have interacted with a lot of you in comments. I am in the crypto space since 2017 and I am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain. I am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good off-ramp options available for India without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method. This is going to be a long post and I will share the most convenient method in the end (saving best for the last).\n\nMethod 1: P2P via CDM (Cash Deposit Machine) using a reputed escrow: \n\nI have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues. It is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap, noones, etc and use CDM option. Only give bank's name and account number (don't give other details like IFSC and others to avoid them doing an IMPS transfer)\n\nPros: You get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere. You are safe from fake notes as CDM handles it. Source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money. You are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers. Best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky.\n\nCons: You need to handle the hassle of P2P trade. Money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable.\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Buying gift cards from Bitrefill, SpendCrypto etc:\n\nMost of you may be familiar with this already. SpendCrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than Bitrefill. You can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges, paying utility bills, spending for purchases etc.\n\nPros: Privacy friendly. You can avoid the hassle of a P2P trade and handling the scammers.\n\nCons: Amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards (especially new accounts). Compatibility issues (If you buy card intended for other country, it may not work in your country). The rates you get per USDT is like below 80 rs sometimes. On SpendCrypto it is near 83 rs value per USDT.\n\nMethod 3: Virtual Visa cards loaded with crypto:\n\nThis is the most convenient method by far I have seen. Unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players, Redotpay is a gamechanger. Some of you were asking me to write a post about it (here it is). You can download Redotpay app from App store or Play store and complete your KYC, apply for a virtual visa card for $10 fee (DM me before creating an account and I will tell you how to get it for $4). They also offer a physical card for $100 (you can get it for $70). You can also get a $5 free first time credit. SO basically you are getting the virtual card for free. But note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card.\n\nPros: This card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like Amazon, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit, Zepto, etc (except Paytm). I have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on NameCheap, Hetzner etc. If your device supports NFC, you can add your virtual card to Gpay and pay in NFC supported POS machines. Please use my invite code: 4c3ad if you want to sign-up and it will be a small contribution to me. The physical card can be used to withdraw cash in ATMs. Beware of the charges though.\n\nCons: Nothing much to complain about them. KYC is one (but to get a Visa card it is a obvious). ATM withdrawal fees for physical cards. It also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card (about a month sometimes). You get 82.7 ish value per USDT (still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business)\n\nOther methods: I am currently researching about withdrawing USDC via Moneygram outlets. Will update once I have enough experience.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods. I'm open to discussion. Take care guys! Have fun.\n\nDisclaimer: Guys, please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space. Crypto space is full of scammers. Beware! If you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions, start off with small amounts, first learn and then move to big values. Redotpay is a custodial wallet, only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so. Never blindly believe anyone even if it's me. Do your thorough research. All the best.\n\nEdit 1: Added disclaimer.\n\nEdit 2: Added rates or value per USDT that we get for each method.","26":"Zepto, a 10-minute delivery app, raises $665 million at $3.6 billion valuation ","27":"Zepto Raises $665 Million at $3.6 Billion Valuation Instant grocery delivery app Zepto secured $665 million in funding, led by Glade Brook, Nexus, and StepStone, to expand into new markets and double its dark stores.

Recently, a Zepto employee [admitted](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StartUpIndia\/comments\/1h5h79n\/toxic_work_culture_ft_zepto\/?share_id=UYufMvgWLkloo-m3TnboX) to the widespread use of dark patterns in their app, revealing strategies designed to extract more money from customers. Among these tactics, the app allegedly charges customers with phones priced over \u20b930,000 more than others, effectively using device-based discrimination to increase revenue.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an isolated case. Flipkart was recently in the news for charging iPhone users more than Android users for the same product. Similarly, Urban Company faced backlash in 2022 for pre-selecting premium services, leading customers to unknowingly pay extra.\n\nDark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users. Consumers can protect themselves by reviewing charges, comparing prices, and reporting such practices. Have you faced similar issues?","30":"Is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto (and the others)? Like if I'm buying a Cadbury, the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps and I would get all the prices  that are there along with minimum order price to get free delivery. This would save effort in using 4 or more different apps to check where I get the best deal.","31":"Zepto app review| Honest review | Fast delivery app | Grocery shopping in India. ","33":"My experience with Zepto  I was a daily user of Zepto for the last two months, and I even bought their monthly pass, which offers free delivery on orders above Rs. 100. However, things started getting ridiculous after this point; for every order, they charge an extra Rs. 10 as a platform and handling fee, regardless of whether you're a pass user or a normal user. \n\nMoreover, they made free delivery an optional feature. If you don't manually apply for free delivery, they'll charge you. With these tactics, they keep charging money, and I find it absurd. As a pass user, free delivery should be automatically applied, but you must tap on the free delivery option each time. This can be easily missed when you're in a rush or if kids are placing orders. \n\nNow, let's talk about grocery, fruits, and vegetable prices. Out of all the platforms, Zepto is the most expensive, especially for fruits and vegetables compared to offline stores. Sometimes, the price differences are double! For example, if Yelleki bananas cost Rs. 50\/kg in the offline market, they'll be priced at Rs. 100 on Zepto. The same applies to watermelon and other fruits. Even daily essentials like potatoes and onions have higher prices.\n\nThese apps also encourage you to spend more once you become a pass member by showing extra discounts when you make a minimum purchase of Rs. 300. As a result, most of your orders exceed Rs. 300, and you end up buying unnecessary items.\n\nTheir main goal is to increase the Average Order Value (AOV) and daily user count to achieve profitability, which they aim to do through these pass and discounted price strategies.\n\nI understand the convenience and comfort of getting groceries delivered home, but it comes at the cost of paying higher than market rates.\n\nIn my experience, you can save up to 30% monthly by not using this app.\n\nI'm not against online shopping or e-commerce; I frequently use them. In my experience, Big Basket is better for savings if you plan weekly shopping. For fruits and vegetables, local stores are a more affordable option.","35":"Created a website where you can compare prices of different emarts like blinkit, instamart etc. \n\nHi guys, I created a website where you can compare the prices of multiple emarts like blinkit, instamart, zepto, bigbasket and jiomart.\n\nIts easy to use visit [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/shop-swiftly.in).\nAround a month ago I posted my [android app](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) and received quite a response.\n\nLet me know, hows this? UI might differ as its old video.\n","36":"Why Kiwi Yes Bank CC is my preferred Rupay UPI credit card today (versus Tata Neu Infinity and Jupiter Edge CSB) Here's why I prefer Kiwi Yes Bank credit card over its two competitors (I know Tata Neu Infinity gives Kiwi a close fight and I'm including Jupiter Edge CSB here just because I have it--the card is a flyweight today; no pun intended):\n\n**Why not Jupiter Edge CSB or Tata Neu Infinity:**  \nJupiter Edge CSB has been a poor choice for a while now, ever since it was devalued. It is LTF though. Gives 2% back on UPI spends only on one category (which can be changed quarterly) but even that too can be a hit and a miss. I was barely getting any cashback. Only advantage was free credit period. Also, unless you have a Jupiter savings account (Federal Bank), you can't convert Jewels (their rewards) into real cash. Most often you get 0.4%.\n\nOn Tata Neu Infinity earnings are decent (1.5%) but you get stuck with Neu points rather than real cashback. Neu coins can only be used on Tata platforms (like Big Basket\/1mg). Tata Neu also has limits on UPI earnings (max 500 Neucoins per calendar month). Also, Tata Neu Infinity is normally a paid card, and today only new users to HDFC Bank can get it LTF under a special festive offer. Existing HDFC cardholders can't (this has been communicated to multiple people on this sub recently). HDFC Bank has refused to make my FYF Tata Neu Infinity LTF, which means I will close it before renewal as I don't see enough value to justify the Rs 1499 + GST renewal fee.\n\nComing to Kiwi Yes Bank credit card:\n\n* **2% - 5% real cashback** on scan & pay. Cashback is directly transferred to bank account when I redeem. No closed or proprietary wallet like Tata Neu, and Kiwi also transfers to any bank account, unlike Jupiter\n* Base Reward Rates are 4 Kiwis on UPI spends = 1% cashback and 2 Kiwis on non-UPI spends = 0.5% cashback. Users can subscribe to Neon for additional cashback and lounge vouchers.\n* **First Year Neon Subscription is free** for applications till Dec 31, 2024 (this is optional and user has to opt-in; can opt out Year 2 onwards)\n* Under Neon users get:\n\n\u2022 \u20602% cashback on UPI transactions and 0.50% cashback on Non-UPI transactions  \n\u2022 \u20603% cashback and 1 Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher on spends of > Rs. 50,000 in a year  \n\u2022 \u20604% cashback and 1 more Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher if spends of > Rs 1 lakh in a year  \n\u2022 \u20605% cashback and 1 more Domestic Airport Lounge Access voucher if spends > Rs 1.5 lakh in a year\n\nWhen you cross Rs 50000 in spends (UPI and non-UPI) you get 3% on all UPI spends before milestone was reached, so 1% extra on transactions where earlier 2% was given. Same when you reach other milestones.\n\n* **Minimum transaction value to earn cashback is Rs.50**\n* **Maximum cashback in a calendar month is up to 1% of credit limit**, which is plenty compared to Tata Neu Infinity.\n* The card is **LTF**.\n* Kiwi App has **great UI and UX**; the Tata Neu app is very poor on UI and UX. Jupiter is fairly good, though Kiwi is the best of the lot.\n* Both UPI and Non-UPI transactions are considered for calculating milestones with the Kiwi Yes Bank credit card.\n* Kiwi Yes Bank Credit Card is also eligible for Yes Bank Credit Cards instant discount offers (e.g. on Amazon, Swiggy, etc).\n* Kiwi has separate discount offers on platforms like Swiggy, Zepto, Zomato, etc. So you get **Yes Bank offers + Kiwi offers**.\n* Excluded categories for base cashback & milestone: Fuel, Jewellery, Wallet Load, Insurance, Education, Rent, Utilities, Telecom, Government Payments, TV Cable services and EMI transactions\n* The icing on the cake for me has been the surprise cashback I get on regular UPI spends (via bank, not credit card) done on the Kiwi app. Small amounts, but certainly welcome!\n\n**Negatives**\n\n* I didn't get cashback on 1 or 2 merchant spends till date. Have got Kiwis on 99% of transactions.\n* Is great for only one year if Neon is not offered free next year, as base cashback is only 1%. However, in my experience most UPI credit cards are short lived before they implode in a devaluation, and I expect there will some new UPI credit cards next year. Super Money's superCard Plus, looking at you! Is expected soon and headlines are 3% cashback on all UPI scan and pay spends and an LTF card to boot.","37":"DMart user tries Zepto  \nI\u2019ve been an investor in DMart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from DMart for many years to ensure we stay self-sustainable \ud83d\ude02. I tried Zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact DMart in the long run. Here are my two cents:\n\n1. **Experience with Zepto**: It was really good and fast, and cheaper due to coupons, but not when compared to DMart's prices.\n\n2. **Will I buy from Zepto again?**  \n   Sure, I will. Who doesn\u2019t want a few quick deals in the name of a discount?\n\n3. **Will I continue investing in DMart or invest more?**  \n   Yes, I will. Until quick commerce burns VC capital, I\u2019ll stay invested. Once the business model is proven to fail, DMart will likely boom.\n\n**How long can VCs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption?**  \nOnly until the IPO, or six months after the IPO due to the lock-in period.\n\n\n**Updates:**\n\nMost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend Blinkit:\n\n**Usability of the application:**\n\n\n**1. Once people become accustomed to an app, they are unlikely to switch, even in the absence of discounts.**\n\nIn my view, this isn\u2019t entirely true, at least in India.\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Recent news highlighted how Jio and Airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes.\n\n\u2022 How many of us stick to just one quick commerce app? Isn\u2019t it common to compare prices between Swiggy and Zomato before ordering food?\n\n\n**2. The elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price:**\n\nAgain, I\u2019m unsure how long this will hold true. The same elite crowd often shops at stores like Zudio and Westside for the in-store experience, rather than relying on online platforms like Myntra or Amazon.\n\n1. Personally, I used to buy meat from an online app for several years. However, after receiving stale meat once, I switched to buying meat directly from shops. These shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options.\n\n\nOne alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of over 315 for Zomato\u2014a tech company with a profit of just \u20b9250+ crores\u2014while being hesitant to invest in DMart, which has a profit exceeding \u20b9650+ crores and a much lower P\/E of 87.\n\nIn my opinion, the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor. However, how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer. Until then, I believe both quick commerce and brick-and-mortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar. ","38":"Tech is cheap don\u2019t invest too much.  \nI\u2019ve been in the tech field for the past three years, and I\u2019ve noticed some posts in the community claiming that tech is too expensive and unaffordable. However, the truth is quite the opposite.\n\nWith the evolution of hybrid frameworks like Flutter and React Native, developing an app has become much more affordable. If you're a hardworking student or intern who dedicates 5 to 6 hours a day, you can have your app ready within a month with a budget of just \u20b95,000 to \u20b910,000.\n\nWhen it comes to servers, there are already free options available for the first year. Setting them up has become incredibly simple these days. Take Heroku, for example\u2014just one command, and your server is up and running.\n\nIf you find a good tech person who can manage resources efficiently, you can complete your app, website, or server within a budget of \u20b920,000 in a span of 2 to 3 months.\n\nI\u2019m referring specifically to small feature applications like zepto\n\n\nThis is for people who doesn\u2019t have funding.

Is this a joke?\n\nWhen you have a pass for any grocery app, the delivery charge is waived off by default when it\u2019s applicable. \n\nZepto used to waive the delivery fee by default until recently, they\u2019ve started giving an option to waive it off. I don\u2019t see such a thing with Instamart. \n\nShouldn\u2019t Zepto minus the delivery fee by default? \nAnyone else who faced this?","41":"Zepto in Kochi is getting sneaky Was indifferent at the start when Zepto arrived in Kochi and then they offered their \"pass\" at a few bucks.

Super quick deliveries. \n\nTime for renewal of membership. Still some bucks (, though technically it had tripled now, I think) Prices were still low, but higher than earlier. Deliveries still fast but slower than earlier. The app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here (not what you want to learn from your competition. Looking at you Swiggy!) still good.\n\nNow, they've gotten really sneaky with their pricing. A few things are still on discounted rates but most aren't. But the real sneaky part is where they don't show the split of the prices anymore. You need to go look for it. And here's the best part, you need to now enable free delivery. Sneaky buggers. Guess much like the other delivery apps, this too will be just another option. \n\nDon't know if they would be able to sustain. What are your thoughts and experiences with the app?

Now, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s relevant to you.\n\n  \nFor our startup, we are building our app. We have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns. We recently secured funding and are looking to scale. We\u2019ve built Version 1 \n\nand launched it on the App Store and Play Store. We\u2019re now working on Version 2, and for that, we\u2019re looking for interns with experience in native app development. Don\u2019t close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development; bear with me, I have something for you :)\n\n\n\nJust let me clear it here : we don't give a single fuck about your CGPA. Excellence is what we are looking for. \n\n\n\nbut before starting out, I want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired. \n\n \n\n3 months ago, we hired 2 interns from one of the top college, both were girls. One had an impressive CV with crazy projects, languages, and all that, while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance, promising she wouldn\u2019t disappoint us. We hired both, and even while they were learning, we started their stipend. (how we searched for them? we circulated msg's on their whatsapp college groups) However, we noticed that the girl with the great CV was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it (Like literal laughable excuses) She was doing all the mediocre work nothing special, just the bare minimum(sometimes not even bare minimum) with delayed submissions and all.  \n   \nIn startups, things move fast, and you have to learn quickly and adapt. She wasn\u2019t doing that, but on top of that, she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend. On the other hand, the second girl, who asked for a chance, did extremely well.\n\n She put in the effort and did what was expected, staying on top of her tasks.\n\nA week ago, the first girl with the great CV sent us a message saying she couldn\u2019t continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for GATE at IIT. (It was all lie, like as usual) and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work. This whole situation was a lie. How did I know? Because previously she added me on LinkedIn, and yesterday, I saw her comment under a LinkedIn post asking for another internship, attaching her CV\n\n\n\nI won\u2019t comment further on her, but put yourself in my shoes. Imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return.\n\n\n\nSo, this is the exact type of person we don\u2019t want to hire. We really don\u2019t want any \u201cinternship farmers\u201d who aim to do 5-6 internships just to make their CVs shinner than the moon itself. \n\nIf that\u2019s your goal, we\u2019re not interested.\n\n\n\nWhat we want?\n\n\n\nWe want some smart Individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life. This doesn\u2019t have to be a project; we don\u2019t want another CV decorator who just wants to paint their dry CV with some internships. We want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return. \n\n\n\nThis is a paid internship.   \n\n\nPreviously, we offered no-conditions paid internships, but because of our past experience, we just don't want to burn our money.\n\n\n\nIf you reading this, you fall under 2 categories :\n\n\n\nKnows about Native app development :\n\nwe\u2019ll assign you a task with a set timeframe of a week. If you complete it within the timeframe, we\u2019ll start your stipend.\n\n\n\nDoesn't know about app development :\n\nEven if you don\u2019t know anything about app development, but you\u2019re a determined individual who wants to achieve something, then you are welcome in our startup.\n\nWe are ready to invest in you. working with a starup will teach you more than any course could ever teach you.Within a year of working with a startup, you will surpass all of your peers or people from your college\n\nFor Learning, we\u2019ll first provide you appropriate material to study and will keep a check on  your progress every 3-4 days. If you show that you\u2019re a smart, quick learner, we\u2019ll start your stipend. \n\nThis is for those with no experience but a strong desire to do something meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis opportunity is open to everyone, even if you\u2019ve just started your first year of college. Doesn't matter. We\u2019re looking for excellence and for people who are ready to put in the hard work.\n\n\n\nFuture plans :\n\n\n\nIf you stick with us: We\u2019ll continue paying your stipend, and once we have full confidence in your work after 4-6 months, we\u2019ll hire you directly.

Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S. Don't judge me as some marketing agent of Flipkart or Axis. I'm an ardent member of this sub, always looking for those tips and hacks. Also, I'm not against SBI CB, HDFC swiggy or millenia, I too have SBI CB, it's a beast that I happily use for other purposes. It's just that I haven't closed my FK Axis rn, bearing that \u20b9590 annually \ud83d\ude05, cuz who knows. And Axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past. If you can use and keep it all, better. But, always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robo-thinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber.","50":"New Zepto Scam?

I am a businessperson in Guwahati and been doing business for the last 8yrs. \n\nSo i have been researching on starting a business of quick-commerce. Been to Bengaluru for it and got a first hand experience with BlinkIt and Zepto. I know it will be a tough place to compete but i have a few ideas which will give my business some advantages over them. I have this whole thing planned out and i believe this can be made into a huge business because there is a huge demand for it. I have planned the supple chain, recruitment, the cashflows, delivery and almost all aspects of this business. \n\nThe only thing i am stuck at is the tech part. I need an app. But i have limited knowledge about creating and mostly about maintaining the app. \n\nI dont want to make an app by a third party(which is very easy) - not because i need to pay them, but i want someone who is equally passionate about this and want someone who can concentrate and give enough time to this. \n\n\nSo i hv been looking for someone who is knowledgeable, passionate hardworking and serious about doing this business. \n\nIf you are serious and professional, i m ready to discuss about sharing ownership and do the necessary paperwork.

(Hello, terribly sorry if this isn't the right flair or sub for this. )\n \nEdit- ((No they didn't take my phone but who knows, don't be like me ))\n\nMyntra delivery guys are asking to show Myntra feedback form which you receive in your mail which rates Myntra services and then giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it. \n\nWhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver it'll be given separately they are saying no it's from the same form. When explained that delivery rating is separate from Myntra rating they're unable to explain themselves and saying no it's the same. (It's not) \n\n\nIf you're ordering stuff online you might be used to delivery guys asking for feedback and sometimes they insist we do it in front of them, right? It has happened with me several times with even Zomato, instamart, zepto etc. \n\nSo I thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback BUT the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of MYNTRA NOT THE DELIVERY EXECUTIVE. \n\nHe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail I told him I won't because I do not want to rate Myntra a 5 without even opening my order. I told him I'll rate him for sure but I don't want to rate Myntra a 5 for no reason. He said no no it's the same form for both . When I questioned his logic he wasn't able to explain and then left. \n\nThe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup, not even delivery. \n\nThe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof. \n\nThis is all really shady and makes no sense. Why should we rate Myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it. When you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and that's all they should care about. \n\nPlease don't give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service. If yes, tell them you can do that on app. And don't let them rate it for you. \n","54":"I hate Zepto. As a consumer, I'm doing everything so that it burns itself So I used Zepto only because a friend referred it to me. And till this day, I've never used it except to spend Zepto cash on something I *really* need (essentials only)\n\nAnd I spend it very carefully. I used to get almost \u20b9125 daily for a few days then it reduced to \u20b975, so I buy only the stuff that is Zepto cash eligible. I used it once for the 25% promo and \u20b9125 to almost get a free delivery and only buy stuff where I'm making minimum cutoff amount of \u20b999 and spending the bare minimum. \n\nI once just tried to fill the cart with I may or may not need, and saw this surge fee where the code leaked. (Not a coder, so if someone can make sense of it, lemme know). Ofc I deleted most items later to not spend on it.\n\nI don't have their stupid pass subscription because they just want you to activate it to show the investors, so I intentionally decline it every time, only to see a \u20b91 difference, so I just don't buy it. \n\nI also don't need any paper bags, I have plenty. But since I'm keen on Zepto failing like another byjus, I specifically untick it to add the bag to my already existing pile of bags.\n\nI only order essentials, where zepto looses money, and use the free cash to pay for it. \n\nTill date in a total of 10 orders I've not paid anything more than a total for ~200-300 max (that too because I had friends at home once), so yeah, a net order spend of ~\u20b925.\n\nSo yeah, if you hate zepto, and really want to see it fail, I'd suggest you follow this strategy.\n\nI mean ofc, this case is an exception, and not the general crowd is like this, but I thought I'll just put it out in the open for once.\n\nAnd yeah if you want 25% off on your next order (upto 200) let me know lol I'll send the referral link to you on DM. Ofc, I get something similar too, but upto 800, which I'm sure I won't spend on the app, so yeah. Idk. I just want to watch zepto burn.\n\nWhy so much hate? Because I want the VCs behind Zepto to realise that burning money isn't gonna get you anywhere. Principles of business stay the same. You're trying to cash out on a greater fool theory only to dump it to dumb retail investors and please your silent partners. It's sort of an ego thing of forcing zepto to make money by burning money, and making Aadit a puppet. Just stop doing this and be real for once.","57":"Zepto in Hubli?!! is it true? for some reason the app won't install on my phone atm. I hope its true!!

Getting it was an easy process, though I also had to send them a mail from my work account for verification. The total process took 5 business days including v-KYC and the card was delivered soon to my permanent address. Unfortunately, they don't accept rent agreement as current address proof so I had to proceed with the card being delivered to my permanent address.\n\nComing to the usage of the card itself, when I got a card, there were a lot of AU Bank credit card offers on apps like Zomato & Zepto though now I don't see them anymore. I was also able to use the international lounge in T2 Bengaluru airport with it. I also did some transactions in pounds & AED and they really were 0 forex with no DCC (Dynamic Currency Conversion) applied. I have also attached a screenshot of some transactions and just for reference the current conversion rates (from Google) have also been mentioned below.\n\n1 GBP = 105.83 INR\n1 AED = 12.61 INR\n\nPS: The credit card control section of Ixigo app stops working as soon as you're outside India, so if you have to enable international transactions, please make sure you do it before you leave the country. Once you're out of the country, you won't be able to change any controls or even see your transaction history. ","59":" Found price differences across grocery delivery apps \u2013 building a solution!  So, I was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting. The price on BigBasket was \u20b989, on Blinkit it was \u20b9105, and Zepto had it for \u20b998. Naturally, I wondered \u2013 if the prices for one item differ this much, what about other groceries? I checked a few more items and, sure enough, almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts, promotions, or delivery fees.\n\nThat got me thinking: why isn\u2019t there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps?\n\nImagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get real-time price comparisons from Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, Swiggy Instamart, and others. You\u2019d see all the discounts, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times in one place, allowing you to make informed decisions and save money, just like you do when booking a hotel on Trivago.\n\nI\u2019m planning to build this app and would love feedback, suggestions, or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting.

Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. They are very clever to ensure that the phones time is not visible when you are on the app but I can assure you both. The screenshots are 15 minutes apart.","81":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Aug 19th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","82":"Please help me understand this I couldn't find anywhere else to put it, Zepto doesn't have a subreddit. \n\nMy mom bought these items from Zepto thinking she would get a Rs. 100 discount. While it shows in the app, the invoice is completely different. Even the handling charge\/packaging charge is different.\n\nPlease help me make sense of this. Mom couldn't make sense of it, so she asked me, even I can't make sense of the calculations. \n\nI tried everything, but just don't understand. It just feels like a scam (I know it's not). The total is the same , but the calculations are not\n\nAlso, is there anywhere I can ask them about this?","85":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","86":"Quick Commerce: The Good, the Bad, and the Crowded \ud83d\udef5 So, I\u2019ve been hooked on this whole quick commerce (q-commerce) thing lately\u2014basically, apps like Blinkit, Zepto, or Instamart that deliver stuff faster than it takes me to find my shoes. Forgot milk for your coffee? Bam, it\u2019s at your door. Midnight froyo craving? Done. It\u2019s like glamping for your grocery shopping\u2014convenient but kinda extra.\n\nHere\u2019s the tea:\n\nThe Pros (AKA Awesomesauce Moments)\n\n1. Convenience Supreme: Need it now? You got it. No more last-minute dashes to the store.\n\n\n2. Techie Vibes: The whole \u201cdark store\u201d concept and how it all runs like clockwork is kinda fascinating.\n\n\n3. Staycation Ready: Perfect for days when you\u2019re too lazy to even think about leaving the house.\n\n\n\nThe Cons (AKA Side-Eye Material)\n\n1. Crowded Space: Everyone and their dog seems to be launching a q-commerce app. The competition is wild.\n\n\n2. Labor Drama: The rush to deliver in 10 minutes? Not so fun for the folks on bikes or scooters braving traffic.\n\n\n3. Impulse Traps: Did I need that second round of snacks? Nope, but here we are.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cool and all, but I\u2019m wondering if this is just another hellacious trend in the retail race or something that\u2019s actually here to stay. Plus, with everyone jumping in, it feels like the market is a little overcrowded.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? Is q-commerce your go-to lifesaver, or does it make you wanna photobomb its hype? Let\u2019s hash it out!","88":"Zepto charging delivery fee because all items are not available in a single store I want to order these two things but as they are not available in a single store, Zepto is charging 30 rupees as delivery.\n \nI mean it's not my concern if they aren't available in a single location. It's available in the app so it's on Zepto to deliver the products and show them as a single order. \n\nIf it's Swiggy\/Zomato then it's understandable that I want to order from different places and thus I'll pay the extra delivery fee. But for Zepto\/Blinkit etc it's their headache to make the things available in one single place.\n\nPlease let me know if my opinion is wrong.","89":"Zepto\u2019s \u201c5-Minute\u201d Delivery: A Satirical Tale of Varna Minutes and Vanishing Riders (I\u2019m in Shantigram)  \nYesterday, I had the honor of discovering Zepto\u2019s unique interpretation of time. You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. Both are 15 mins apart but see the time difference on the app. They are very clever to ensure the phone\u2019s time is not displayed while you\u2019re on the app \ud83d\ude42","90":"Experts of subs help a 21yr old choose a credit card So i already own tata neu card and a juliter app , what are some other great options do i have?\n\nI just want some cash back on my tata electricity bill and on UPI.

So guys if you are planning to buy a fruits from zepto then think twice,my suggestion is not to buy a fruits from any app's.

","97":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0[r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/\/)\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

At that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs, frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder. She said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open, we can only initiate an refund request. It was 1.30am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a CoD this time and found out there\u2019s No CoD available why??.

Hardly any startup have succeeded globally or have an original idea ? Is the Valuation game just a joke ?  I left India in my 20s lived in eu for few years & settled in US for 2 deacdes , but still travel globally every week including visits to India every month , so I observe & compare these markets very closely.\n\nIndia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017. The digital currency, ondc & several transformational initiatives. Stock Market is riding high on the modi wave , so is Inflation , purchasing power & rupee valuations (may be on purpose ) has gone down  drastically. Cost of a good meal is same or higher in India compared to US\/EU , but income isn't comparable.\n\nI keep seeing lots of startups coming up , but none are able to succeed on a global platform , several are acquired by west backed competition ,  most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west. \n\nExcept a lenskart , zoho , bookmyshow & a few more handful, none of them have succeeded in global arena. Why is that? If the product was good ,it should have , right ?  I understand some business need not go global , but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nUbers, amazons were  able to Penetrate indian markets & eat local share , but a ola or flipkart hasn't gone global .\nZomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses , Oyo has acquired lot of properties , but they just loss making properties & are still in losses.  \n\nWith the largest pie of IT engineers in the world , we haven't had a single app\/product that's globally used, we have only been a consumer market. With 12 % of world population & biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\nI remember using flipkart in the beginning once & the website design & layout itself were a mimic of Amazon forget the business model , I had doubts if they will succeed , but ended up being sold for billions. \n\nMama earth is a rip off of Babyganics including its branding &  green colors, but it's valued at 5000 cr .\n\nWe keep seeing lots of half baked products on Indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr+ . \n\nThere was a lot of VC funding coming , so valuation game was On , but lately foreign VC funding  has dried up , as most investments are yielding profits & exits are just based in hype based valuations.\n\nZepto is a great example , how a company with no unique IP is valued so much & already people are claiming its model is a failure &  not scalable. Those 2 young kids don't have the same charm or intellect that we saw in Gates or jobs when they were young. Lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nThe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success , whereas in India we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nBut how long will this circus last ? Only till VC funds dry up or when NRI\/rich Indians stop pumping into this game ?\n\n I am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent , we are capable , but the new set of Heros that are projected aren't worth it & my concern is that they don't oversell & fail ,  making it worse for future entrepreneurs","122":"Safety issue with zepto Ordered few grocery on zepto at night around 10 pm.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n\n\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) on the r\/ecommerce subreddit for a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Join free at www.shopifreaks.com","149":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

","159":"Best Gamification features! I'm a big fan of cricket and during this world cup season I see apps brining in innovative gamification features into their app like Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy etc. It's sometimes quite interesting to engage with and honestly I enjoy them too. :)\n\nI recently noticed another amazing feature. So I'm a sucker for Call of Duty Mobile app and a frequent gamer as well. For those who don't know, CODM has an event section like almost all games have. They had added a simple arcade gamification feature in it where you have to complete the game in order to redeem your points and gain rewards.\n\nIt was quite intriguing for me as they had thought of putting in a very simple, low graphics arcade game in their app which is like one of the heaviest and most downloaded gaming app on Play Store. First it seemed silly, but it worked for them, because I observed I had a little fun while playing that small game to complete the event, lol!\n\nWhat are some of the most intriguing gamification features you've come across on apps?","160":"Suggestions for selling e-commerce stack Hello Folks,I built a Saas platform that helps sellers build and launch their online stores in minutes. To achieve least setup effort for the sellers, this platform has pre-made sections that can be added to quickly create a landing page.

This platform is currently serving 10 customers.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","168":"Help me pick a stack! So I'm currently a PHP\/Typescript guy, looking to rewrite my long overdue for an overhaul SAAS. I'm not on a timeline and very open to learning something new. \n\nContext: \n\nIt's a niche social networking app think Facebook but adult, sites have about 1m users (not all active obv). Currently running on a 3 dedicated servers, microservices on AWS, assets on cloudfront\/s3. About 1-2k  concurrent users across timezones. \n\nFrontend :\n\nFirst thought for frontend was React, but (React developers about to hate me) I really don't think it's very SEO friendly (spongebob meme but Google parses js rendered blah blah) but I also have a large international userbase so payload size is a big factor. \n\nI thought about using it just for the members area which is a obviously a great use case for react. The only problem is there's a lot of crossover content from the publicly accessible content and writing it twice is not an option. \n\nVue.js  seems to be a possibility and seems possible to get a decently small payload, and would be more friendly to SSR which would solve the public\/members reusability issue so I guess I'd like some reasons I'm wrong for this thought process. \n\nOld school Jquery\/Bootstrap\/SASS style? Obviously super light (zepto) but been there done that and while it's light AF, and gels with my minimalistic OCD. I really like the component based approach with newer frameworks. \n\nBackend : \nSSR is definitely a major requirement.  Something that plays nicely with component re-usability. Kinda thinking Nest.js(Nuxt?)  but there a part of me that really wants to dabble with Go. I'd like to use websockets for messaging\/notifications and it seems go is a bit better resource-wise for that, but it doesn't seem like there are a lot of templating options (based on 3 seconds of googling please advise) as something like a Laravel. Which I have the added benefit of 20 years of experience in (PHP at least) \n\nSo..Now that I've pissed off every developer here\u2026 I'm an open book. Really trying to look at this with all possibilities. I'm kind of old school, I really like minimal dependencies and honestly enjoy building out from the bare metal as much as possible \n\nOpen to any and all discussions and debate. Alll options have pros and cons and I'd love to hear your opinions on what you would use in my scenario.

including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information technology act 2000\nnext byjus in the making \ud83e\udd14\nsince its being openly talked of i think i recently dodged a bullet here \n\ni had interviews scheduled with someone on a very senior position for a pretty senior position in one of the core departments the person who was supposed to take the interviews didnt show up and not once but thrice in three different time slots\ud83e\udd37\n\nafter the third noshow i told the hr to get their business in order first and then think of anything else\n\ni guess i should be thanking him now \ud83d\ude05\n\nedit with the post going so viral i feel like posting all the screenshots that i have these are the follow up messages i sent the non conclusive responses from hr and the non attended calls \ud83d\ude05","1":"zepto has the stupidest appcustomer support i made an order of around 400 and now its saying theres rainfall in your area theyre not delivering my order its been more

using zepto all together sorry for you op\nand they constantly keep shoving the zepto pass in your ass\ni stopped using zepto when they sent clearly rotten vegetables twice and refused to give me a refund all they said was a generic we will ensure this does not happen in the future deleted my account and uninstalled the app zepto was the first fast delivery app but man have they gone to the gutter\nzepto customer care teams are the worst i have ordered two items and one chocolate bar was missing when the item reached home i contacted the support and they asked me to send the picture of the package lol how can i send the picture of the missing item then they said that the item was there when it was delivered it seems also the item was packed too i argued that there can be a chance that the delivery guy must have taken it they denied that as well they said they wont issue the refund i deleted the app right away\nsame here they delivered a wrong variant of a product and i am trying to return it but their customer support is shit nothing is working on their customer support side stopped ordering from zepto and uninstalled the app bigbasket instamart and blinkit are far

checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still verifying their hiring status\n\n4

in apps are becoming increasingly common these deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products subscribing to unnecessary services or revealing personal data\n\nheres a strategy to protect yourself\n\nuse a lowrange smartphone buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for users in the age range of gen z as theyre frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns stay vigilant and always doublecheck before making purchases or commitments online\n\nhave you experienced dark patterns share your story below bhai jitna phone aur recharge mein chala jayega utna to order bhi nhi karta mai\nthanks for the feedback well also put the check on the delivery address \n\n zepto team\nso youre saying i gotta spend 10k on a phone and minimum 200 on a sim plan every month to save 5rs off of 1kg rice how does that even make sense\nop is the definition of penny wise  pound foolish\ni guess ill just go to the local kirana store for groceries from now on

collection\n2 any major operational challenges im missing\n3 how to handle local body permissionsregulations\n4 anyone here from bangalore who can share insights about waste management pain points\n5 thoughts on scalability to other cities\n\nlooking for honest feedback especially from people whove run operationsheavy startups or those familiar with waste management space\n its not just the collection you need the entire waste management process segregation recycling disposal etc otherwise youre just creating a landfill\nif govt sees youre earning more than them on a certain place they have a control knock knock youve got some company \n\n\neither theyll pass laws outlawing you or get you to bribe heavy\nbiggest pain point for me personally is i work night shift i cant wakeup early morning to dispose waste to the government collectors i cant leave it out for them to collect because animals might spil it i will use the garbage collection model especially for time\nbut starting it out as a startup i believe you will get a lot of challenges from government side because i read somewhere bangalore municipality is looking at the similar model to implement in the upcoming years so getting approvals maybe hard but if you can elaborate more on what you will do after collecting waste like how environmental friendly your model will be maybe make you stand out from government model you will have an working app thats a plus as well\nyoure forced to pay a shitload of taxes in every big city to the municipality every year it is the job of the government to come to your home personally and do the garbage collection everyday some activism from citizens in the local bbmp office should work and you can thank the workers by giving them some monetary allowance during dasaradeepawali every year\ntrust me people will rather throw the garbage in the roads instead of paying anything","6":"created an app in which you can compare prices between multiple platforms like

inception this was my first time ordering with zepto so i got a free premium pass with this order resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know i can send him money over through gpay but i dont know i am skeptical of everyone ever since i got scammed  his insistence of asking to check gpay sounds like fraud to me\nive had this happen with me multiple times zeptoblinkituber delivery guys ke sath fuel ke liye paiserationsschool textbook etc they have always promised to return the money ive always chosen to believe them and have given the money \nthey never did \neven after i kept calling

scam hi hai imo \nif you really want to help then better to buy the ration for him instead of just giving money\nwhen ever some one is extra polite to me i become worried about my money\nbruh thats sad it does feel shitty when you wanna do something about the situation but you simply cant\nthis is sad what is even sadder that when youve been scammed then even if you want youre apprehensive to

scam one of my friends introduced me to their partner today they are running some kind of business the reason for the introduction was that they are going through an expansion and looking for potential partners\n\nthey set up a meeting at chaayos park square mall first a person came to meet meher partnerand explained that the senior partner a lady would come to meet me to see if i have the vision and mindset for the business and if im likeminded enough to partner\n\nthe lady boss came for a general introduction she didnt say much about herself and insisted on getting to know me better she asked why i wanted to do business my plain answer was to make money and take on challenges to learn and gain confidence in life she responded by saying that you can find challenges anywhere and i insisted on not missing the monetary benefits she asked why i hadnt started earlier and i said i didnt have a clear idea to start with and didnt want to go into commodities since my job is paying well in that case then she talked about the mindset of zeptos founders a food delivery app and how they succeeded even after dropping out i called her out saying she was wrong and corrected her by saying zepto is a food delivery app she responded by saying this is not a debate and that she just wanted to convey the mindset aspect\n\ni asked about the business and she said i wouldnt be able to fully understand it then she explained that they are in b2b ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to make my decision and have the money ready and once im in the business i would understand it fully she added that if it were on the internet or so public everyone would be doing this we are exclusive and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a partner we need to know each other and the business well i cant understand anything without being inside the business she said \n\nthis friend is more of an acquaintance and i dont know a lot about her how we met is an interesting story but it doesnt add any context here\n\nthe job requires 23 hours a day done digitally that friend bought a car recently and quit her fulltime job as well\n\nsounds like an mlm scheme or scam to me but is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it what is this business how does it operate is it legitimate\n\ni said no to join because i cant be part of anything i dont fully understand and its not public or on the internetanything protected and very private is a red flag for me and i cant put the money in it blindly\n\none more thing they kept calling each other sirmaam even though they are colleagues not a bangalore scam  it is an all india scam  you are right  it is a mlm or multi level marketing scheme  they talk as if what they are doing is the next big thing with some abstract terms compare their ideas to some successful founders they sell a lavish lifestyle wear fancy outfits and act like ceos and tell us that we need to get out of the routine 9 to 6 job rat race and to be financially independent and be our own boss they meet mostly in coffee shops as they have no office  and travel back usually in two wheelers or uber auto do not fall for their duplicate gucci bags  they are here to suck your money  dirty lowlife scums  instead of working to earn an living they are scamming other inoccent folks or thier hard earned savings\nyou didnt have to type this much its definitely a

offramp crypto withdrawal options for india  my experience hey guys this is my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method most realest post out here\nfinally somebody answered all my questions big ups\n2 days ago i found out about redotpay and my initial thought was eh its too good to be true glad you mentioned redotpay now ill do my thorough research on it\nthese are good for smaller amounts\ngreat read i need to know the withdrawal processes and this post helps in a way","26":"zepto a 10minute

to extract more money from customers among these tactics the app allegedly charges customers with phones priced over 30000 more than others effectively using devicebased discrimination to increase revenue\n\nthis isnt an isolated case flipkart was recently in the news for charging iphone users more than android users for the same product similarly urban company faced backlash in 2022 for preselecting premium services leading customers to unknowingly pay extra\n\ndark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users consumers can protect themselves by reviewing charges comparing prices and reporting such practices have you faced similar issues country delight is a prime example of employing dark patterns in their business practices they deliberately use nonstandard product quantities like 450g900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg making comparisons harder for customers additionally they push customers into purchasing vip memberships by showcasing misleading discounts which are actually deducted from the membership amount creating a false sense of savings even their cow milk which used to come in 500ml packs has been reduced to 450ml for new customers these practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust the list of such tactics goes on\nthis is an old use case for tech  research has consistently shown iphone users go for paid while android wants free apps have just extended that \n\nive seen hotels do differential pricing for apple vs android its usually because acquiring an iphone customer is more expensive and businesses know they have the ability to pay\n\ni dont know if you remember there was a case of uber charging more based on phone battery i would consider that discriminatory\ndeleted\ni definitely am i have ios and husband had android just last week during nykaa sales i wanted to restock some products and prices were lower on his phone because i had seen a reel too about this so i decided to check\nthis is not particular to zepto almost all the apps record basic details of device when you open it  mobile device brand carrier location and few more based on that they starts to figure out different derived results\nthere are other very advanced ways of deriving user profile by sms reading income credits debits device details availability of user when do u respond to notifications etc all and many more can create very good profile of any one they know your locality and all the others in the area to figure out its type  upscale midscale low scale your prices offers and other variables changes accordingly\n\n\nevery touch and view on device is recorded these days","30":"is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on swiggy blinkit zepto and the others like if im buying a cadbury the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps and i would get all the prices  that are there along with minimum order price to get free delivery this would save effort in using 4 or more different apps to check where i get the best deal ","31":"zepto app review honest review  fast delivery app  grocery shopping in india  ","33":"my experience with zepto  i was a daily user of zepto for the last two months and i even bought their monthly pass which offers free delivery on orders above rs 100 however things started getting ridiculous after this point for every order they charge an extra rs 10 as a platform and handling fee regardless of whether youre a pass user or a normal user \n\nmoreover they made free delivery an optional feature if you dont manually apply for free delivery theyll charge you with these tactics they keep charging money and i find it absurd as a pass user free delivery should be automatically applied but you must tap on the free delivery option each time this can be easily missed when youre in a rush or if kids are placing orders \n\nnow lets talk about grocery fruits and vegetable prices out of all the platforms zepto is the most expensive especially for fruits and vegetables compared to offline stores sometimes the price differences are double for example if yelleki bananas cost rs 50kg in the offline market theyll be priced at rs 100 on zepto the same applies to watermelon and other fruits even daily essentials like potatoes and onions have higher prices\n\nthese apps also encourage you to spend more once you become a pass member by showing extra discounts when you make a minimum purchase of rs 300 as a result most of your orders exceed rs 300 and you end up buying unnecessary items\n\ntheir main goal is to increase the average order value aov and daily user count to achieve profitability which they aim to do through these pass and discounted price strategies\n\ni understand the convenience and comfort of getting groceries delivered home but it comes at the cost of paying higher than market rates\n\nin my experience you can save up to 30 monthly by not using this app\n\nim not against online shopping or ecommerce i frequently use them in my experience big basket is better for savings if you plan weekly shopping for fruits and vegetables local stores are a more affordable option zepto sent me spoiled strawberries and when i reported they kept sending me message let us know your location bruh you just delivered me the stuff asking me again and again  stopped using them completely\nthank you for sharing your experience it is true that fruits and vegetables are cheaper in offline stores and probably everyone is aware of it the reason people order from zeptoblinkitinstamart is for the convenience thus you are forced to pay extra\ni feel zepto is a moral less company for below reasons\n\n1 free delivery not auto applied\n2 sell zepto pass for 1 rupee that too automatically added to cart and their founders brag about 4 million subscriptions for this garbage\n3 i used to work for zeptos competitor gave two rounds of interviews for an open position at zepto the interviewers were more interested in my companys internal data and how we do pricing \n\n\nany companys morals flow top down from founders you see the point im

why i prefer kiwi yes bank credit card over its two competitors i know tata neu infinity gives kiwi a close fight and im including jupiter edge csb here just because i have itthe card is a flyweight today no pun intended\n\nwhy not jupiter edge csb or tata neu infinity  \njupiter edge csb has been a poor choice for a while now ever since it was devalued it is ltf though gives 2 back on upi spends only on one category which can be changed quarterly but even that too can be a hit and a miss i was barely getting any cashback only advantage was free credit period also unless you have a jupiter savings account federal bank you cant convert jewels their rewards into real cash most often you get 04\n\non tata neu infinity earnings are decent 15 but you get stuck with neu points rather than real cashback neu coins can only be used on tata platforms like big basket1mg tata neu also has limits on upi earnings max 500 neucoins per calendar month also tata neu infinity is normally a paid card and today only new users to hdfc bank can get it ltf under a special festive offer existing hdfc cardholders cant this has been communicated to multiple people on this sub recently hdfc bank has refused to make my fyf tata neu infinity ltf which means i will close it before renewal as i dont see enough value to justify the rs 1499  gst renewal fee\n\ncoming to kiwi yes bank credit card\n\n 2  5 real cashback on scan  pay cashback is directly transferred to bank account when i redeem no closed or proprietary wallet like tata neu and kiwi also transfers to any bank account unlike jupiter\n base reward rates are 4 kiwis on upi spends  1 cashback and 2 kiwis on nonupi spends  05 cashback users can subscribe to neon for additional cashback and lounge vouchers\n first year neon subscription is free for applications till dec 31 2024 this is optional and user has to optin can opt out year 2 onwards\n under neon users get\n\n 2 cashback on upi transactions and 050 cashback on nonupi transactions  \n 3 cashback and 1 domestic airport lounge access voucher on spends of  rs 50000 in a year  \n 4 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends of  rs 1 lakh in a year  \n 5 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends  rs 15 lakh in a year\n\nwhen you cross rs 50000 in spends upi and nonupi you get 3 on all upi spends before milestone was reached so 1 extra on transactions where earlier 2 was given same when you reach other milestones\n\n minimum transaction value to earn cashback is rs50\n maximum cashback in a calendar month is up to 1 of credit limit which is plenty compared to tata neu infinity\n the card is ltf\n kiwi app has great ui and ux the tata neu app is very poor on ui and ux jupiter is fairly good though kiwi is the best of the lot\n both upi and nonupi transactions are considered for calculating milestones with the kiwi yes bank credit card\n kiwi yes bank credit card is also eligible for yes bank credit cards instant discount offers eg on amazon swiggy etc\n kiwi has separate discount offers on platforms like swiggy zepto zomato etc so you get yes bank offers  kiwi offers\n excluded categories for base cashback  milestone fuel jewellery wallet load insurance education rent utilities telecom government payments tv cable services and emi transactions\n the icing on the cake for me has been the surprise cashback i get on regular upi spends via bank not credit card done on the kiwi app small amounts but certainly welcome\n\nnegatives\n\n i didnt get cashback on 1 or 2 merchant spends till date have got kiwis on 99 of transactions\n is great for only one year if neon is not offered free next year as base cashback is only 1 however in my experience most upi credit cards are short lived before they implode in a devaluation and i expect there will some new upi credit cards next year super moneys supercard plus looking at you is expected soon and headlines are 3 cashback on all upi scan and pay spends and an ltf card to boot most of the points are spot on especially the app experience however as long as one is sticking to upi\n\nremember a credit cards functionality is to give the user maximum benefit out of purchases\n\nas far as tata neu is considered its a great card overall and not just for upi you get almost unlimited 5 on major brands which you would be using on a very frequent basis the 1499 renewal is justified for some users maybe but even i am not one of those however having a big purchase once in a while can give you actually good rewards in neucoins which definitely can be used at a lot of places \n\nas far as jupiter is concerned never used it nor i like the idea of having to switch i cant plan my life according to a card spend pattern\n\nkiwi hands down give the best user experience and the most ease for upi transactions and the fact it is ltf makes it so rewarding in conjunction to any card which give on a average more benefits in all types of spends\nreally liking kiwi upi i was using coral rupay from icici which is completely useless\nmost of my upi spends are in small kirana stores or street vendors who generally have their personal accounts qr instead of a merchant account or rent to the house owner personal account wherever cc is accepted i pay via cc just thinking about getting kiwi for the rupay cc primarily to clean up my bank statement of these low value upi transactions not sure if it will work or makes sense in my case due to the case mentioned above\ngot my kiwi card and first statement generated\n\nmy finding\n\n1 they charge 59 on fuel spends so dont use it for fuel for 200rs they charged 1180rs previously did one fuel transaction with icici coral rupay no additional charge was included\n2 after receiving 500 kiwis im not getting any cashback af far i know 2 of your credit limit is the maximum cashback you can get so my credit limit is 25k it means 500rs is my limit but after 132rs around 542 kiwi i havent received any kiwis for 56 payments\n3 op you get flat 2 cashback on scan and pay not on all upi spends\n\n\nanyone interested in applying for kiwi card i can share you my referral link\n\n\nforgot to mention kiwi app gives you additional 20 discount in zomato and swiggy upto 100rs minimum txn value of 399\none downside i have been facing with cc on upi is acceptance many merchants have disabled cc payments via upi because they are being charged mdr i guess things will only get worse with time  given that the govt is now reducing incentives on their digital payment push \n\ni am not sure when but eventually npci will also require to charge mdr on upi maybe for spends beyond a certain value","37":"dmart user tries zepto  \nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later","38":"tech is cheap dont invest too much  \nive been in the tech field for the past three years and ive noticed some posts in the community claiming that tech is too expensive and unaffordable however the truth is quite the opposite\n\nwith the evolution of hybrid frameworks like flutter and react native developing an app has become much more affordable if youre a hardworking student or intern who dedicates 5 to 6 hours a day you can have your app ready within a month with a budget of just 5000 to 10000\n\nwhen it comes to servers there are already free options available for the first year setting them up has become incredibly simple these days take heroku for examplejust one command and your server is up and running\n\nif you find a good tech person who can manage resources efficiently you can complete your app website or server within a budget of 20000 in a span of 2 to 3 months\n\nim referring specifically to small feature applications like zepto\n\n\nthis is for people who doesnt have funding  tech buddy say software hardware costs crores to build\nive been in the tech field for the past three years\n\nand you have learnt nothing\n\nyou have apparently no idea about scaling an app to handle a million concurrent users trying to login at the same time\nbro move ahead from side projects good software takes time experience and money\nbuilding an app is very easy\n\nbuilding an app that actually works well in the real world is tough\ni disagree with most of the things in the post \nbut i agree with tech and tech building tools have gotten better and faster and cheaper \nbut you are down playing the effort that is needed to build software products \ni develop apps and websites so it is a little personal to me sorry for the bias\nso things have gotten cheap yes \n510 thousand is the rate you pay for unskilled labour or you exploit hardworking and talented students if you do that or encourage that shame on you \nthere will be a noticeable difference in quality of a 20k app developed in three months by a hardworking intern vs what is done with actual resources who work in the field \nrates are insane and the margin is insane too agreed but that is for big players who churn out quality product and give quality support etc\nyou seem to have a very superficial understanding of how things work here even after 3 years so i am assuming you are from sales and not get involved in the technical execution part more often my advice is to talk to more freelancers firms and even interns compare their work vs what they charge then you will understand where all that extra money goes","39":"new zepto workflow scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by

that needed to be ticked in order to avail the offer \ud83d\ude11\nthese apps are unprofitable and have to resort to such practices in desperation \n\nmaybe design a better business model thats actually sustainable lol\ninstamart blinkit zepto  follow this instamart is good blinkit has a lot of products and zepto only if you need something which is unavailable on both the apps\ni even tweeted this tagging them  they simply asked to dm my details and then ignored","41":"zepto in kochi is getting sneaky was indifferent at the start when zepto arrived in kochi and then they offered their pass at a few bucks worth a try right the rates were unbeatable their little brown bags were cute too till i had a pile of it here i dont need a bag enabled i found myself buying all groceries from them super quick deliveries \n\ntime for renewal of membership still some bucks  though technically it had tripled now i think prices were still low but higher than earlier deliveries still fast but slower than earlier the app says the guy is here but it takes another 5 minutes for them to actually get here not what you want to learn from your competition looking at you swiggy still good\n\nnow theyve gotten really sneaky with their pricing a few things are still on discounted rates but most arent but the real sneaky part is where they dont show the split of the prices anymore you need to go look for it and heres the best part you need to now enable free delivery sneaky buggers guess much like the other delivery apps this too will be just another option \n\ndont know if they would be able to sustain what are your thoughts and experiences with the app do you think itll be much like the countless food spots that pop up every other day and are gone in a few months here in kochi i uninstalled zepto for this very reason it should be applied automatically\ndark patterns these are called\nheard they are using kochi as some testing ground for their features as they are relatively new here and the user base is lower than other regions\ni really reduce my dependance on online grocery and food delivery apps as much as i can unless i am in a tight situation\neven though this didnot happen to me other than oncebut the app is so laggy and smtimes the cart price and their price seems 1020rs diff even making me count it manually","44":"worst delivery app dunzo placed an order with dunzo  took more than 2 hours to deliver stating theres no delivery partner  unable to cancel cause the app said the order is processed  tried to communicate with them but its a one way communication with a bot which they did not even reply later  \nalso i realised after that i could get the same order in zepto for a way lesser price which i later did and they were at least very responsive over the chat although there was a slight delay which i completely understand cause of the delay \n\npoint is  their customer service sucks and they should atleast give us an option to cancel the order is they cannot deliver it within the promised time  dunzo is finished dont use it\nmy money stuck in dunzo since january 2024 with no delivery assigned ever and no refund its a total scam\ni think there should be a psa to not use dunzo anymore it is a dead app now has been for almost a year now\n\nthe scummy part is that theyre not removing the app from store\ni dont know if you guys keep up with news dunzo closed last year december when reliance bought majority share\ndunzos been struggling for a while now with difficulties in raising capital executive exits layoffs and other cost cutting most of the places ive seen using dunzo for delivery in the past have switched to porter to handle their deliveries","45":"starting my new venture that helps d2c brands deliver

wearing santa claus dress yes with cap and all it took me by surprise \n\nwhile i was processing it in my head he wishes me merry christmas and asks for a selfie also maybe they need to upload on the app so that the company can track if the christmas theme idea that they had in mind gets applied on ground level also \n\nit made my day sadly it was a prepaid order or i would have told the guy is this my christmas present santa\n\nanyone else got santa delivery partner not an answer to your question \n\ni would be pleasantly surprised  kids would love meeting the santa\n\n\nbut i did find it quite amusing  nice marketing gimmick \ntheres a promo today that you get a chocolate box for orders over 400 also if you take a selfie with the delivery person they get 40 from zepto\nvisiting

i can assure that in next 3 years we will be an unicorn to give you a brief idea about us we are a delivery startup \n\nyou might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories \n\n\n\nknows about native app development \n\nwell assign you a task with a

their flipkart axis card for sbi cb and other cb cards\n tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom","50":"new zepto scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by default when its applicable \n\nzepto used to waive the delivery fee by the

giving it a 5 and taking a photo of it \n\nwhen told if they want feedback for delivery driver itll be given separately they are saying no its from the same form when explained that delivery rating is

sometimes they insist we do it in front of them right it has happened with me several times with even zomato instamart zepto etc \n\nso i thought he must be asking for delivery driver feedback but the form he rated himself and took photo of asked for experience of myntra not the delivery executive \n\nhe took photo of one and when he asked me to open another mail i told him i wont because i do not want to rate myntra a 5 without even opening my order i told him ill rate him for sure but i dont want to rate myntra a 5 for no reason he said no no its the same form for both  when i questioned his logic he wasnt able to explain and then left \n\nthe same thing happened again today and it was a return pickup not even delivery \n\nthe first guy even called someone and asked her if this is the right form that he has to rate and take photo as proof \n\nthis is all really shady and makes no sense why should we rate myntra a 5 and why should the delivery driver out of all people ask for it when you go to orders there is a separate option for rating the delivery guy and thats all they should care about \n\nplease dont give your phone to them if they ask to take a photo and question them if they want feedback on their delivery service if yes tell them you can do that on app and dont let them rate it for you \n by reading the title i thought the delivery guy took the phone and ran off\ni told the delivery person that i dont get feedback emails and messages from myntra when he asked me for it he then requested me to give him a high rating  if i get any feedback form which i dont mind as hes been delivering for almost 5 years\nbro eatsure always did it  before i ate the food also  \nthey would take it and give everything 5\neatsure uses this tactic when you order from

and till this day ive never used it except to spend zepto cash on something i really need essentials only\n\nand i spend it very carefully i used to get almost 125 daily for a few days then it reduced to 75 so i buy only the stuff that is zepto cash eligible i used it once for the 25 promo and 125 to almost get a free delivery and only buy stuff where im making minimum cutoff amount of 99 and spending the bare minimum \n\ni once just tried to fill the cart with i may or may not need and saw this surge fee where the code leaked not a coder so if someone can make sense of it lemme know ofc i deleted most items later to not spend on it\n\ni dont have their stupid pass subscription because they just want you to activate it to show the investors so i intentionally decline it every time only to see a 1 difference so i just dont buy it \n\ni also dont need any paper bags i have plenty but since im keen on zepto failing like another byjus i specifically untick it to add the bag to my already existing pile of bags\n\ni only order essentials where zepto looses money and use the free cash to pay for it \n\ntill date in a total of 10 orders ive not paid anything more than a total for 200300 max that too because i had friends at home once so yeah a net order spend of 25\n\nso yeah if you hate zepto and really want to see it fail id suggest you follow this strategy\n\ni mean ofc this case is an exception and not the general crowd is like this but i thought ill just put it out in the open for once\n\nand yeah if you want 25 off on your next order upto 200 let me know lol ill send the referral link to you on dm ofc i get something similar too but upto 800 which im sure i wont spend on the app so yeah idk i just want to watch zepto burn\n\nwhy so much hate because i want the vcs behind zepto to realise that burning money isnt gonna get you anywhere principles of business stay the same youre trying to cash out on a greater fool theory only to dump it to dumb retail investors and please your silent partners its sort of an ego thing of forcing zepto to make money by burning money and making aadit a puppet just stop doing this and be real for once this is a really sad post the fact that you would spend this much time to do something that is not constructive to anyone and then would go on to spend the time to write an elaborate post about it boggles my mind is this what you want to spend your mind and time on\n\nand fyi none of what youre doing is even going to put a dent on their business at the end of the day regardless of what some pennycounting redditor thinks of them theyre going to reap the benefits of adding value to their customers \n\ni routinely use zepto and love the app i use it because it adds value to my time and im happy to pay extra for the convenience if my order on zepto is more expensive than me going to buy it in the store because i value my time more than i value the few rupees if it ever becomes so expensive that it starts to feel like a rip off i will find alternatives that work \n\nim never going to invest my time and energy on trying to kill their business \n\nwake up if you think youre even putting a dent on their business youre burning your time for no consequence of value not to you nor anyone\nthis remind me of a scene from the sitcom silicon valley where richard orders bulk of pizzas at once to bankrupt a

credit card review i know this sub doesnt really love co branded credit cards much but this ones been quite spoken about especially as a travel credit card due to it having 0 forex charge and good lounge access while being offered ltf for now\n\ngot this card in around march primarily because i had a foreign visit and also because i needed lounge access getting it was an easy process though i also had to send them a mail from my work account for verification the total process took 5 business days including vkyc and the card was delivered soon to my permanent address unfortunately they dont accept rent agreement as current address proof so i had to proceed with the card being delivered to my permanent address\n\ncoming to the usage of the card itself when i got a card there were a lot of au bank credit card offers on apps like zomato  zepto though now i dont see them anymore i was also able to use the international lounge in t2 bengaluru airport with it i also did some transactions in pounds  aed and they really were 0 forex with no dcc dynamic currency conversion applied i have also attached a screenshot of some transactions and just for reference the current conversion rates from google have also been mentioned below\n\n1 gbp  10583 inr\n1 aed  1261 inr\n\nps the credit card control section of ixigo app stops working as soon as youre outside india so if you have to enable international transactions please make sure you do it before you leave the country once youre out of the country you wont be able to change any controls or even see your transaction history  i dont think this sub has issues with cobranded cards\ud83d\ude05 some of the cobranded credit cards are soo good\nwhy you are using ixigo app for card control just use bank app to do that\nthis sub doesnt hate come branded for sure every other day youll find posts about how to get apay airtel axis swiggy hdfc etc\naed to inr conversion from google looks off itd always 20\nhello op and thanks for the detailed review\n\ni had a question about international lounge access is it allowed to access the lounge with a 1 family member\n\nplanning a trip to dubai so this card makes a lot of sense based on my income  \nsome options i was considering were icici makemytrip signature and idfc wow card but the latter is fd backed\n\nthanks","59":" found price differences across grocery delivery apps  building a solution  so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can do it and using ai could even make it better but its difficult to monetize lots of companies have failed to do such things and pivoted into other ideas\n\nthe puzzle to crack here is monetization the feature in itself can be built easily","61":"privacy breach by blinkit \ni just witnessed customer privacy breach by blinkit as rider told me that they r made to share photos of customers with silver gold coin to whatsapp group of blinkit i documented that in video and he even showed me the whatsapp group with numerous pictures of people with gold n silver coins isnt it is safety issue for person who ordered  ridiculous \n\ni even asked aap apne hath mai khichlo to this rider replied nahi sir apke saath picture chaiye company ko deni hoti hai i thought and said yes as zepto etc do usually same but they have inbuilt app feature to do this so its atleast safe but when i saw him opening camera application and photo being saved in his personal mobile i questioned then things started getting unfolded\n\ni opted not to debate with the rider as he was just doing what he was asked to do \nbut its blinkit which still need otp for delivery person to enter on silver gold delivery then why customer photo that too with gold silver coin is required and that too on whatsapp group which which have other riders and etc people  \n\nps note i have tried yo blurredput gif on people mobile and faces to protect their privacy\n\ni dont want that it affect livelihood of riders but company seriously needs to go do ground work \n\n dont judge me or whatever but bhai sona chandi online kharedna is bit idiotic in my opinion\neven if its like for verification of coin received by the customer it shouldnt be on a whatsapp group with images being saved on the riders personal

commerce apps just using it for reference here\n\nso i added 2 items to my cart one for 170 and the other for 100 so the total is 270 now these are already mrp items so the tax is include\n\nthe app added a handling fee  1 tobacco product convenience fee and delivery fee of 999 19 and 27 respectively which are all understandable\n\nwhat i dont understand is that gst and cess on handling is 4 4004 and on delivery is 1082 4007 respectively last i remember the maximum highest gst was 28 how are they charging approximately 40\n\nalso i noticed although i have zepto pass the free delivery isnt auto applied you have to manually apply it the only thing i hate is\nto have to click on apply to unlock free delivery like bitch who wants to click everyone wants free delivery\nsomewhere we allowed these food delivery appsknowingly or unknowingly to loot us we all became dependent on these apps and somehow we gave them the power and now theyre making profits  with all the access\n1082 is 18 on 56 482 i dont know maybe someone else can shed a light\ngst is 18 balance may be cess due to tobacco\nmany products like sugary carbonated beverages attract a gst of 28 plus 12 cess adding up to 40 your rationale that the maximum gst in india is 28 is wrong","69":"zepto cash not working what to do  so yday i added 10k in my zepto cash and today morning thought of ordering alot of random stuff \nbut

app to shop at participating retailers in europe klarna already has a banking license has offered similar services in germany since 2021 and is now expanding itll offer customers interest rates as high as 358 for savings in the us klarna doesnt have a banking license and is operating through partner banks its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the us as the money held isnt protected by the fdic there is also no interest offered to us customers\n\ntiktok users in the us who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to 300 in discounts or a 100 amazon gift card for every new creator they refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for thirdparty messaging apps like whatsapp to share and discuss videos\n\nftc announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase the new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators the rules prohibit fake consumer reviews buying or selling reviews insider reviews misrepresentation of companycontrolled review websites and review suppression ftc chair lina khan wrote fake reviews not only waste peoples time and money but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors by strengthening the ftcs toolkit to fight deceptive advertising

subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules \n\nsoundcloud launched a merch marketplace called soundcloud store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch the first edition of

and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its soundcloud store from there soundcloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch the service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100 of the profits from sales \n\namazon is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products either that or amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake  paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them amazon told fortune that the limited test only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages \n\nx is closing its operations in brazil but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being according to a post from its globalaffairs account which wrote last night alexandre de moraes threatened our legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in brazil rather than respect the law or due process as a result to protect the safety of our staff we have made the decision to close our operation in brazil effective immediately\n\ntiktok is urging a federal appellate court in washington dc to block the protecting americans from foreign adversary controlled applications act which will effectively ban tiktok if its owner bytedance doesnt divest the app to an americanowned company by april tiktok calls the statute the most sweeping speech restriction in this countrys history and claims that it singles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million americans in its new filing last thursday tiktoks legal team claimed that the us is illegally singling out tiktok and that the governments fears are speculative and lack hard evidence the justice departments legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information and the doj has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a top secret classified designation\n\nnood an american bra brand known for its adhesive bras nipple covers and boob tape is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature indecent or inappropriate which has resulted in censorship shadow bans and removal of their advertisements this ones tough to judge on one hand i understand where nood is coming from just because their products are made for womens breasts doesnt intrinsically make their products sexual in nature on the other hand some of noods ads are objectively sexualized designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless only to look closer and discover

me to find my shoes forgot milk for your coffee bam its at your door midnight froyo craving done its like glamping for your grocery shoppingconvenient but kinda extra\n\nheres the tea\n\nthe pros aka awesomesauce moments\n\n1 convenience supreme need it now you got it no more lastminute dashes to the store\n\n\n2 techie vibes the whole dark store concept and how it all runs like clockwork is kinda fascinating\n\n\n3 staycation ready perfect for days when youre too lazy to even think about leaving the house\n\n\n\nthe cons aka sideeye material\n\n1 crowded space everyone and their dog seems to be launching a qcommerce app the competition is wild\n\n\n2 labor drama the rush to deliver in 10 minutes not so fun for the folks on bikes or scooters braving traffic\n\n\n3 impulse traps did i need that second round of snacks nope but here we are\n\n\n\nits cool and all but im wondering if this is just another hellacious trend in the retail race or something thats actually here to stay plus with everyone jumping in it feels like the market is a little overcrowded\n\nwhat do yall think is qcommerce your goto lifesaver or does it make you wanna photobomb its hype lets hash it out quick commerce is going to be a thing of luxury in future when the cash is over it will be a convenience for which you will be ready to pay 1525 extra vs a brickmortar this will happen as soon as the current companies hit a ceiling in growth and no longer have extra cash to burn i just read in a research paper that its 25 costly to send a low margin grocery product via delivery vs selling on store due to logistics\n\njust like how unacademy ended up opening their offline centres you will see instamart zepto etc opening up supermarkets instead of just dark stores in order to capture both offline and online intent buyers\n\ni hope i am right because i cant see the traditional stores dying","88":"zepto charging delivery fee because all items are not available in a single store i want to order these two things but as they are not available in a single store zepto is charging 30 rupees as delivery\n \ni mean its not my concern if they arent available in a single location its available in the app so its on zepto to deliver the products and show them as a single order \n\nif its swiggyzomato then its understandable that i want to order from different places and thus ill pay the extra delivery fee but for zeptoblinkit etc its their headache to make the things available in one single place\n\nplease let me know if my opinion is wrong do you have a free delivery pass or something if not toh bhai tumhe convince ke paise bhi nahi dena hai kya\nmany times we do not calculate the bill and delivery charges\ntoday i tried ordering stuff for rs200 and to my surprise blinkit is charging\u00a0 rs 50 while zepto is charging around rs90 to 100 \ni need to cancel both times","89":"zeptos 5minute delivery a satirical tale of varna minutes and vanishing riders im in shantigram  \nyesterday i had the honor of discovering zeptos unique interpretation of time you see they promised me a 5minute deliverya magical feat that could make even amazon prime blush i placed my order imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials reality a solid 1520 varna minutes later for the uninitiated varna time works like dog yearsmultiply by three my order finally arrived\n\nthinking this was a oneoff glitch i reached out to zeptos customer service big mistake heres how that went\n\t1\tcustomer service attempt 1 were trying to contact the rider\ntranslation weve lost the rider please send thoughts and prayers\n\t2\tcustomer service attempt 2 the rider went to the wrong location\ntranslation our gps works about as well as our delivery times\n\t3\tcustomer service attempt 3 crickets\ntranslation weve decided to ghost you\n\nto add insult to injury the apps order history mysteriously stopped loadingeverything else worked fine but not the one feature i needed coincidence i think not\n\ndetermined to validate my experience i ran a little experiment today same order same 5minute promise result a 35minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport meanwhile blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutesand actually deliver within that timeframe shocking i know\n\nso dear zepto is this your new business strategy lure us in with false promises frustrate us with disappearing riders and then leave us questioning our life choices if so its working brilliantly\n\nscreenshots enclosed because sometimes you just need receipts to cope both are 15 mins apart but see the time difference on the app they are very clever to ensure the phones time is not displayed while youre on the app \ud83d\ude42 its the same case with blinkit and instamart they say 7 of 9 mins delivery and then your order will come whenever convenient to them not that i didnt mind getting my order in 15  20 mins but why promise such a false time of delivery","90":"experts of subs help a 21yr old choose a credit card so i already own tata neu card and a juliter app  what are some other great options do i have\n\ni just want some cash back on my

stole it \n\nfirst post here so pardon my writing\nso i ordered a pizza from mojos and the outlet is 15 mins from my place hardly in the app it showed a total waiting of 30 mins smthg i have a tendency of checking my food every min when im on edge i suppose everybody does so after 15 long mins of waiting finally it reaches a point where its out for delivery after 5 to 7 mins roughly the order showed delivered i instantly called the delivery person and guess what hes not answering after 2 attempts i called zomato cs and surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the delivery guy as soon its out for delivery got the food this time still i didnt got my money back yet zomato\n\nive also used blinkit swiggy eatclub zepto it was my first time going through this has anyone faced the same recently if so have u got the refund at the least\nafter this i am unable to trust prepaid orders or zomato the same any more\n\nnotewhy not considering two factor authentication for food deliveries like we get on amazon myntra and flipkart unless someones enjoying exploiting this loop hole deepinder goyal this happened to me also but i dont think its zomato to blame mojo pizza uses their own delivery network so its third party zomato refunded my money as well i wrote to eatclub parent co of mojo pizza regarding the bad experience and they said they raised the issue to the outlet manager never ordering from any eatclub brand again zomato should blacklist eatclub\nits been over a year now my zomato app doesnt show the cod option\nbeen using swiggy good so far had the similar incident as op \nanother delivery person picked my order and my delivery

globally or have an original idea  is the valuation game just a joke   i left india in my 20s lived in eu for few years  settled in us for 2 deacdes  but still travel globally every week including visits to india every month  so i observe  compare these markets very closely\n\nindia has done a lot of progress especially since 2017 the digital currency ondc  several transformational initiatives stock market is riding high on the modi wave  so is inflation  purchasing power  rupee valuations may be on purpose  has gone down  drastically cost of a good meal is same or higher in india compared to useu  but income isnt comparable\n\ni keep seeing lots of startups coming up  but none are able to succeed on a global platform  several are acquired by west backed competition   most were just rip off of ideas that succeeded in the west \n\nexcept a lenskart  zoho  bookmyshow  a few more handful none of them have succeeded in global arena why is that if the product was good it should have  right   i understand some business need not go global  but any big economy has succeeded only when they had global companies \nubers amazons were  able to penetrate indian markets  eat local share  but a ola or flipkart hasnt gone global \nzomato has shut their offices in gulf after huge losses  oyo has acquired lot of properties  but they just loss making properties  are still in losses  \n\nwith the largest pie of it engineers in the world  we havent had a single appproduct thats globally used we have only been a consumer market with 12  of world population  biggest internet access we are the biggest market for any industry\n\ni remember using flipkart in the beginning once  the website design  layout itself were a mimic of amazon forget the business model  i had doubts if they will succeed  but ended up being sold for billions \n\nmama earth is a rip off of babyganics including its branding   green colors but its valued at 5000 cr \n\nwe keep seeing lots of half baked products on indian shark tank being valued at 100 cr  \n\nthere was a lot of vc funding coming  so valuation game was on  but lately foreign vc funding  has dried up  as most investments are yielding profits  exits are just based in hype based valuations\n\nzepto is a great example  how a company with no unique ip is valued so much  already people are claiming its model is a failure   not scalable those 2 young kids dont have the same charm or intellect that we saw in gates or jobs when they were young lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nthe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success  whereas in india we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nbut how long will this circus last  only till vc funds dry up or when nririch indians stop pumping into this game \n\n i am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for future entrepreneurs we still have a very good business pan india for example take arun \nwhy indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity once srk said this gurbat me creativity nahi hoti meaning theres no creativeness when youre poor and i personally believe its the reason you see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background other thing i believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture a mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person \ntimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade \npeople are now accepting entrepreneurship is something in india but still we have a long way to go\nindia is kind of late to the technology scene i remember in 19971998 there used to be to 12 computer hardware shops in nehru place while in us dotcom scene was so booming which eventually led to the bubble in 2000 we were so far apart \n\nyou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 1020 years our startup scene only started in around 2007 it takes a good 1015 years to build a solid foundation yes we lag behind  will continue to lag behind usa but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less there are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news which is good actually\n\ngrey orange pine labs postman chargebee rivigo  and so on\nzoho is an outlier currently another 510 years more and well have more indian startups thatll be used globally\ni think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success as you mentioned in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that \n\ntake zerodha for example they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a valueadded product \n\nanother example would be finshots ditto insurance which started off with making finance accessible to the layman currently working towards making insurance available to everyone excellent product and excellent founders going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight\n\nim sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game which will organically shine when their time comes\nthe current startup scene in india fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for unicorn status is  misguided it fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class zomato byjus and swiggy are classic examples\n\nperhaps a more sustainable approach would be for india to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets as peter thiel emphasizes in his book zero to one true startups should focus on creating something entirely new not just replicating existing models zoho and zerodha are commendable examples of indian companies that have done just that\n\nindia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit with a higher proportion of selfemployed individuals than perhaps any other nation except maybe china government and investors should have prioritized established homegrown successes like naga mills haldirams and everest these companies admired internationally for filling genuine gaps represent indias true entrepreneurial strength instead the focus seems to be on lossmaking ventures like ola and swiggy businesses arguably unsuited to the indian markets current needs \n\nperhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging india is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population by fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs india can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders not just a select few\n\nyall stop being copy

would need in todays time theres an app called ground news its relatively new and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication how many times the story has been shared by known conservative or liberal media how each side of the spectrum showsheadlines the news and tries to catch misinformation \nits

intriguing \n\nexecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe itll help spark something new\ncan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust  also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the

from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant similarly for grocery delivery i dont know if any of these platforms have apis that you can utilize for this and that could make this

hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on september 15th the uk was the first international market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing to expand into new markets its strange though to call the uk a new market given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago while only having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company

incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok

page while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages \n\nx is closing its operations in brazil but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being according to a post from its globalaffairs account which wrote last night alexandre de moraes threatened our legal representative in brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders he did so in a secret order which we share here to expose his actions despite our numerous appeals to the supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in brazil rather than

advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature

to maximise the benefit\nright now i have hdfc millenia and airtel axis card which covers 5 cashbacks for major online purchase and utility bill payments through axis the spend where i dont get cashbacks was other online merchants which millenia doesnt not give and some online grocery stores like zepto instamart \nwas thinking how to cover those i am confused between sbi cashback and hsbc \nsbi cashback is really great option but using park app i am afraid it may devalue in coming time and then the card benefits would just be straight 5 \nas for hsbc it would cover only my grocery needs but could be a good option if i want to cover those\n\nanyone experienced in this sub please tell me which one should i go for\nin short i want to cover all merchants to atleast get some value while purchasing\ud83e\udd23 get both via cashkaro app youll get the joining fees back at least also i think hsbc gives out apay vouchers as well\n\ndoesnt hurt getting these 2 cards for 2k \n\nyou also get airport lounge access with hsbc as well\n2 totally different cards mate sbi cashback is better than millennia but if you hv millennia ltf then thats it u dont need sbi no point having both keep what u hv or close one and get the other ur call unless u r maxing out your card benefits which i think is very unlikely\n\nhsbc cashback makes 100 sense for u if u like me spend more offline and that too mostly on food n groceries only thing r u living in a metro coz only limited pincodes are covered","158":"got a probable scam sms transaction of usd 00 on icici bank credit card xxxxxx is

on zepto app for inr 720 at exact same time  unless you dont deal with foreign currency frequently just keep it disabled by default on all ur cards\nso i know this one i called customer care and visa conducts this test to check if your card is active this specifically happened to me when the card was about to expire hope this helps icici is generally very helpful to explain this over customer care\ncould be a scam just to be safe disable international transactions and enable only when you need them\ncan you check senders details is it legit\n\nsomething similar to this happened with me in the past and in panic i closed the card and ordered a new one \nyou can block the card for sometime and verify the authenticity of the message in the meanwhile contact icici support theyre pretty quick to respond\ni dont know how it is nowadays but back when aliexpress was working i used to order from it through my debit card it would just ask cvv and expiry unlike domestic transactions where they ask otp too as a layer of protection so if someone got hold of your card details through any data leak its pretty much helpless","159":"best gamification features im a big fan of cricket and during this world cup season i see apps brining in innovative gamification features into their app like zepto blinkit swiggy etc its sometimes quite interesting to engage with and honestly i enjoy them too \n\ni recently noticed another amazing feature so im a sucker for call of duty mobile app and a frequent gamer as well for those who dont know codm has an event section like almost all games have they had added a simple arcade gamification feature in it where you have to complete the game in order to redeem your points and gain rewards\n\nit was quite intriguing for me as they had thought of putting in a very simple low graphics arcade game in their app which is like one of the heaviest and most downloaded gaming app on play store first it seemed silly but it worked for them because i observed i had a little fun while playing that small game to complete the event lol\n\nwhat are some of the most intriguing gamification features youve come across on apps ","160":"suggestions for selling ecommerce stack hello folksi built a saas platform that helps sellers build and launch their online stores in minutes to achieve least setup effort for the sellers this platform has premade sections that can be added to quickly create a landing page rest of the pages like category page product page checkout etc have a fixed format and largely opinionated so that sellers dont have to think much and can just launch quickly this platform is currently serving 10 customers here are the links to some of them  makonhome jalsa kalpatree tvisha\n\ni plan to sell this entire stack to people looking to either set up their online store or launch their multitenant ecommerce saas i need your suggestions on whether this is a good idea are people interested in buying something like this\n\nparts\n\n1 admin portal for sellers to set up their products categories payments shipping store layout logo and brand colours there is also an instagram integration to import instagram photos to make products\n2 storefront userfacing website to display products and checkout\n3 worker app to handle async tasks like sending mails indexing products in algolia search\n\nx200b\n\ntech stack\n\n1 sveltekit for both admin and storefront\n2 hono js for backend apis with rpc can be deployed in edge environments like cloudflare workers\n3 maizzle  tailwind to design mails\n4 zoho zepto

to answer i wouldnt touch it with a 100 foot pole\nlooks awesome i think its best if you dont sell ur entire app since you already have clients using them maybe now u could focus on the other aspects of ecommerce like the entire process from ads to ur website to confirming a sale also maybe integration with ondc so the products are available on multiple seller platforms basically making ur app a one stop place for selling a product","161":"monogram items does anyone have a good app they use to offer monograms on their products i currently use zepto product personalizer but the options are

on a 3 dedicated servers microservices on aws assets on cloudfronts3 about 12k  concurrent users across timezones \n\nfrontend \n\nfirst thought for frontend was react but react developers about to hate me i really dont think its very seo friendly spongebob meme but google parses js rendered blah blah but i also have a large international userbase so payload size is a big factor \n\ni thought about using it just for the members area which is a obviously a great use case for react the only problem is theres a lot of crossover content from the publicly accessible content and writing it twice is not an option \n\nvuejs  seems to be a possibility and seems possible to get a decently small payload and would be more friendly to ssr which would solve the publicmembers reusability issue so i guess id like some reasons im wrong for this thought process \n\nold school jquerybootstrapsass style obviously super light zepto but been there done that and while its light af and gels with my minimalistic ocd i really like the component based approach with newer frameworks \n\nbackend  \nssr is definitely a major requirement  something that plays nicely with component reusability kinda thinking nestjsnuxt  but there a part of me that really wants to dabble with go id like to use websockets for messagingnotifications and it seems go is a bit better resourcewise for that but it doesnt seem like there are a lot of templating options based on 3 seconds of googling please advise as something like a laravel which i have the added benefit of 20 years of experience in php at least \n\nsonow that ive pissed off every developer here im an open book really trying to look at this with all possibilities im kind of old school i really like minimal dependencies and honestly enjoy building out from the bare metal as much as possible \n\nopen to any and all discussions and debate alll options have pros and cons and id love to hear your opinions on what you would use in my scenario especially ones i havent considered i would recommend sveltekit for the frontend it has good seo features smaller bundles and loads only what is needed on the current page it also has simpler code and generates vanilla javascript from the code\n\nsveltekit is also very good for ssr with the right adapter\n\n\ni think you might find this approach intriguing\nwhats wrong with your phptypescript stack\n\npicking a different stack would bring you different problems\nid check out laravel with htmlx or hybridly vue for laravel","169":"despite fund raising zepto want to lose

work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information technology act 2000\nnext byjus in the making \ud83e\udd14\nsince its being openly talked of i think i recently dodged a bullet here \n\ni had interviews scheduled with someone on a very senior position for a pretty senior position in one of the core departments the person who was supposed to take the interviews didnt show up and not once but thrice in three different time slots\ud83e\udd37\n\nafter the third noshow i told the hr to get their business in order first and then think of anything else\n\ni guess i should be thanking him now \ud83d\ude05\n\nedit with the

using zepto when they sent clearly rotten vegetables twice and refused to give me a refund all they said was a generic we will ensure this does not happen in the future deleted my account and

the item reached home i contacted the support and they asked me to send the picture of the package lol how can i send the picture of the missing item then they said that the item was there when it was delivered it seems also the item was packed too i argued that there can be a chance that the delivery guy must have taken it they denied that as well they said they wont issue the refund i deleted the

the list\n\n1 moving the list to a git repo or page  \n   some of you have suggested moving this list to a git repository or a page i plan to do that once the list is more complete  \n\n   right now its easier for people to comment and give feedback here which helps me update it quickly\n\n2 worklife balance is subjective  \n   i know that everyones experience with worklife balance can be different  \n\n   my goal is to show a general idea of a companys culture based on feedback from the community this way it gives others some guidance even though it might not apply to every individual\n\n3 about adding new companies  \n   someone pointed out that i had added zerodha earlier without checking if they were hiring engineers thanks for that  \n\n   now im checking if companies are hiring engineers on their careers page before adding them to the list if your suggested company isnt on the list yet its because im still verifying their hiring status\n\n4 focus on experienced professionals  \n   this list is primarily aimed at experienced professionals but freshers are also welcome to use it as a reference it can still provide useful insights into the companies and their cultures\n\n\nedit\n\nsorting it alphabetically so that it is easier to find company names\nchanging low paying to mid paying\n\nchanges made so far \n removed vmware\n moved broadcom from

for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for users in the age range of gen z as theyre frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns stay vigilant and always doublecheck before making purchases or commitments online\n\nhave you

heavy\nbiggest pain point for me personally is i work night shift i cant wakeup early morning to dispose waste to the government collectors i cant leave it out for them to collect because animals might spil it i will use the garbage collection model especially for time\nbut starting it out as a startup i believe you will get a lot of challenges from government side because i read somewhere bangalore municipality is looking at the similar model to implement in the upcoming years so getting approvals maybe hard but if you can elaborate more on what you will do after collecting waste like how environmental friendly your model will be maybe make you stand out from government model you will have an working app thats a plus as well\nyoure forced to pay a shitload of taxes in every big city to the municipality every year it is the job of the government to come to your home personally and do the garbage collection everyday some activism from citizens in the local bbmp office should work and you can thank the workers by giving them some monetary allowance during dasaradeepawali every year\ntrust me people will rather throw the garbage in the roads instead of paying anything"}]],"6":[[{"negative":0.0170389898,"neutral":0.6880861521,"positive":0.2948748767,"aspect":"zepto","text":"created an app in which you can compare prices between multiple platforms like

resulting in me only having to pay 6rs more than the actual mrp of the products \n\nso the delivery guy called me asking for directions and he was being nicer than any other delivery guy i have ever talked to before time passed and he got here earlier than the time shown in the app he greeted me with radhe radhe and i greeted him back the order was prepaid so he takes out my order making small talk and being very polite talking about things like how the employees where about to pack my bananas in a paper bag but he insisted that they be packed in a cardboard box or whatever then he apologized for taking so long he didnt and calling so often for directions wagerahe didnt call that much either he was just being polite by apologizing for unnecessary reasons i didnt know what was coming and i just thought to myself maybe this was his first day on the job and that is why hes so enthusiastic about it he said he had to take a picture of the order for the company and he was still making small talks actually mey night shifts nai krta h lekin aaj mene kuch paise kho diye iss liye krna paar rha h budget toght h rasin vi nai h i was thinking to myself why wouldnt he just give me my order hes just fiddling on his phone it doesnt take this long to take a picture and out of nowhere he drops the bomb on me my dad passed away a year ago he said with a slight tremble in his voice i am having to provide for the whole family and i am not being able to if you could please help me out i promise i will return you the money next week he said now completely in tears and i dont know what to do i am terrible in those situations and i just want to take my order and get back to watching inception i feel sorry for the guy but i dont have shit on me i am 20 years old living alone in a crappy apartment and i only ordered those snacks because i have only had 2 meals in 2 days i finally had some money today because my brother sent me 500rs to get through the week and im gonna have to spend 300rs of that money tomorrow send some parcels home but thats a different story i cannot just give him that money and trust a random stranger to return it after a week even my dad died a little more than a year ago i can relate to his pain and if he is really telling the truth then i cant imagine how much hardwork he probably has to go through to provide for his family being a delivery boy \n\nso anyways he breaks down crying and asking me for some money to buy rasin for his house and i told him that i dont have any money on me and that i can only spare him like 30 to 40rs tops but he insisted that i check my gpay to see if i have some money i dont need to check i have a little over 300rs and all of that extra money im offering him but he just kept asking for more than just 30 40rs and i had had it with him i told him i am sorry but i cant help him out that i am also in a crappy situation in life right now that i couldnt help him out even if i wanted to and finally he said its okay he wiped his tears radhe radhe handed me my order and then i left\n\nthis encounter felt so fricking weird to me but ultimately i feel sorry for the guy and i checked to see if theres a tipping option on zepto but i couldnt find it i know i can send him money over through gpay but i dont know i am skeptical of everyone ever since i got scammed  his insistence of asking to check gpay sounds

ecommerce they would set up my virtual distributor shop and i would get distributorship rights for big corporations selling to retailers i would have 1014 margins shared with all the partners they work in collaboration so if any other partner makes a sale i get my share i would receive lifetime royalties from things sold via my virtual shop\n\nthere are two requirements i have to make a quick decision and invest 45 lakhs that 45 lakhs would be used to secure rights in my name and start my virtual shop\n\ni asked followup questions and she said she couldnt tell me more about the business once i say yes and share my documents for verification she would tell me more and i would need to have the money ready she said that once i get into the business i would fully understand it\n\ni asked if i wanted to know more is there a website or something i could read on she said no we are protected and there is nothing on the internet i asked her to send me at least some documents to read and she said she had already told me everything required she said i need to make my decision and have the money ready and once im in the business i would understand it fully she added that if it were on the internet or so public everyone would be doing this we are exclusive and protected\n\ni had a heated discussion and she left asking me to make the decision and inform my friends then my friend told me this is not the way to talk to a senior partner i said that as a partner we need to know each other and the business well i cant understand anything without being inside the business she said \n\nthis friend is more of an acquaintance and i dont know a lot about her how we met is an interesting story but it doesnt add any context here\n\nthe job requires 23 hours a day done digitally that friend bought a car recently and quit her fulltime job as well\n\nsounds like an mlm scheme or scam to me but is there anyone here who has come across this or been part of it what is this business how does it operate is it legitimate\n\ni said no to join because i cant be part of anything i dont fully understand and its not public or on the internetanything protected and very private is a red flag for me and i cant put the money in it blindly\n\none more thing they kept calling each other sirmaam even though they are colleagues not a bangalore scam  it is an all india scam  you are right  it is a mlm or multi level marketing scheme  they talk as if what they are doing is the next big thing with some abstract terms compare their ideas to some successful founders they sell a lavish lifestyle wear fancy outfits and act like ceos and tell us that we need to get out of the routine 9 to 6 job rat race and to be financially independent and be our own boss they meet mostly in coffee shops as they have no office  and travel back usually in two wheelers or uber auto do not fall for their duplicate gucci bags  they are here to suck your money  dirty lowlife scums  instead of working to earn an living they are scamming other inoccent folks or thier hard earned savings\nyou didnt have to type this much its definitely a scam \ud83d\ude43\ni have to make a quick decision\u00a0  scam\n100

hey guys this is my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method most realest post out here\nfinally somebody answered all my questions big ups\n2 days ago i found out about redotpay and my initial thought was eh its too good to be true glad you mentioned redotpay now ill do my thorough research on it\nthese are good for smaller amounts\ngreat read i need to know the withdrawal processes and this post helps in a way"}]],"26":[[{"negative":0.0041113487,"neutral":0.9614787698,"positive":0.0344098657,"aspect":"zepto","text":"zepto a 10minute delivery app raises 665 million at 36 billion valuation

users for the same product similarly urban company faced backlash in 2022 for preselecting premium services leading customers to unknowingly pay extra\n\ndark patterns like these harm trust and exploit users consumers can protect themselves by reviewing charges comparing prices and reporting such practices have you faced similar issues country delight is a prime example of employing dark patterns in their business practices they deliberately use nonstandard product quantities like 450g900g instead of the typical 500g or 1kg making comparisons harder for customers additionally they push customers into purchasing vip memberships by showcasing misleading discounts which are actually deducted from the membership amount creating a false sense of savings even their cow milk which used to come in 500ml packs has been reduced to 450ml for new customers these practices seem designed to mislead and exploit consumer trust the list of such tactics goes on\nthis is an old use case for tech  research has consistently shown iphone users go for paid while android wants free apps have just extended that \n\nive seen hotels do differential pricing for apple vs android its usually because acquiring an iphone customer is more expensive and businesses know they have the ability to pay\n\ni dont know if you remember there was a case of uber charging more based on phone battery i would consider that discriminatory\ndeleted\ni definitely am i have ios and husband had android just last week during nykaa sales i wanted to restock some products and prices were lower on his phone

location and few more based on that they starts to figure out different derived results\nthere are other very advanced ways of deriving user profile by sms reading income credits debits device details

bought their monthly pass which offers free delivery on orders above rs 100 however things started getting ridiculous after this point for every order they charge an extra rs 10 as a platform and handling fee regardless of whether youre a pass user or a normal user \n\nmoreover they made free delivery an optional feature if you dont manually apply for free delivery theyll charge you with these tactics they keep charging money and i find it absurd as a pass user free delivery should be automatically applied but you must tap on the free delivery option each time this can be easily missed when youre in a rush or if kids are placing orders \n\nnow lets talk about grocery fruits and vegetable prices out of all the platforms zepto is the most expensive especially for fruits and vegetables compared to offline stores sometimes the price differences are double for example if yelleki bananas cost rs 50kg in the offline market theyll be priced at rs 100 on zepto the same applies to watermelon and other fruits even daily essentials like potatoes and onions have higher prices\n\nthese apps also encourage you to spend more once you become a pass member by showing extra discounts when you make a minimum purchase of rs 300 as a result most of your orders exceed rs 300 and you end up buying unnecessary items\n\ntheir main goal is to increase the average order value aov and daily user count to achieve profitability which they aim to do through these pass and discounted price strategies\n\ni understand the convenience and comfort of getting groceries delivered home but it comes at the cost of paying higher than market rates\n\nin my experience you can save up to 30 monthly by not using this app\n\nim not against online shopping or ecommerce i frequently use them in my experience big basket is better for savings if you plan weekly shopping for fruits and vegetables local stores are a more affordable option zepto sent me spoiled strawberries and when i reported they kept sending me message let us know your location bruh you just delivered me the stuff asking me again and again  stopped using them completely\nthank you for sharing your experience it is true that fruits and vegetables are cheaper in offline stores and probably everyone is aware of it the reason people order from zeptoblinkitinstamart is for the convenience thus you are forced to pay extra\ni

infinity and jupiter edge csb heres why i prefer kiwi yes bank credit card over its two competitors i know tata neu infinity gives kiwi a close fight and im including jupiter edge csb here just because i have itthe card is a flyweight today no pun intended\n\nwhy not jupiter edge csb or tata neu infinity  \njupiter edge csb has been a poor choice for a while now ever since it was devalued it is ltf though gives 2 back on upi spends only on one category which can be changed quarterly but even that too can be a hit and a miss i was barely getting any cashback only advantage was free credit period also unless you have a jupiter savings account federal bank you cant convert jewels their rewards into real cash most often you get 04\n\non tata neu infinity earnings are decent 15 but you get stuck with neu points rather than real cashback neu coins can only be used on tata platforms like big basket1mg tata neu also has limits on upi earnings max 500 neucoins per calendar month also tata neu infinity is normally a paid card and today only new users to hdfc bank can get it ltf under a special festive offer existing hdfc cardholders cant this has been communicated to multiple people on this sub recently hdfc bank has refused to make my fyf tata neu infinity ltf which means i will close it before renewal as i dont see enough value to justify the rs 1499  gst renewal fee\n\ncoming to kiwi yes bank credit card\n\n 2  5 real cashback on scan  pay cashback is directly transferred to bank account when i redeem no closed or proprietary wallet like tata neu and kiwi also transfers to any bank account unlike jupiter\n base reward rates are 4 kiwis on upi spends  1 cashback and 2 kiwis on nonupi spends  05 cashback users can subscribe to neon for additional cashback and lounge vouchers\n first year neon subscription is free for applications till dec 31 2024 this is optional and user has to optin can opt out year 2 onwards\n under neon users get\n\n 2 cashback on upi transactions and 050 cashback on nonupi transactions  \n 3 cashback and 1 domestic airport lounge access voucher on spends of  rs 50000 in a year  \n 4 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends of  rs 1 lakh in a year  \n 5 cashback and 1 more domestic airport lounge access voucher if spends  rs 15 lakh in a year\n\nwhen you cross rs 50000 in spends upi and nonupi you get 3 on all upi spends before milestone was reached so 1 extra on transactions where earlier 2 was given same when you reach other milestones\n\n minimum transaction value to earn cashback is rs50\n maximum cashback in a calendar month is up to 1 of credit limit which is plenty compared to tata neu infinity\n the card is ltf\n kiwi app has great ui and ux the tata neu app is very poor on ui and ux jupiter is fairly good though kiwi is the best of the lot\n both upi and nonupi transactions are considered for calculating milestones with the kiwi yes bank credit card\n kiwi yes bank credit card is also eligible for yes bank credit cards instant discount offers eg on amazon swiggy etc\n kiwi has separate discount offers on platforms like swiggy zepto zomato etc so you get yes bank offers  kiwi offers\n excluded categories for base cashback  milestone fuel jewellery wallet load insurance education rent utilities telecom government payments tv cable services and emi transactions\n the icing on the cake for me has been the surprise cashback i get on regular upi spends via bank not credit card done on the kiwi app small amounts but certainly welcome\n\nnegatives\n\n i didnt get cashback on 1 or 2 merchant spends till date have got kiwis on 99 of transactions\n is great for only one year if neon is not offered free next year as base cashback is only 1 however in my experience most upi credit cards are short lived before they implode in a devaluation and i expect there will some new upi credit cards next year super moneys supercard plus looking at you is expected soon and headlines are 3 cashback on all upi scan and pay spends and an ltf card to boot most of the points are spot on especially the app experience however as long as one is sticking to upi\n\nremember a credit cards functionality is to give the user maximum benefit out of purchases\n\nas far as tata neu is considered its a great card overall and not just for upi you get almost unlimited 5 on major brands which you would be using on a very frequent basis the 1499 renewal is justified for some users maybe but even i am not one of those however having a big purchase once in a while can give you actually good rewards in neucoins which definitely can be used at a lot of places \n\nas far as jupiter is concerned never used it nor i like the idea of having to switch i cant plan my life according to a card spend pattern\n\nkiwi hands down give the best user experience and the most ease for upi transactions and the fact it is ltf makes it so rewarding in conjunction to any card which give on a average more benefits in all types of spends\nreally liking kiwi upi i was using coral rupay from icici which is completely useless\nmost of my upi spends are in small kirana stores or street vendors who generally have their personal accounts qr instead of a merchant account or rent to the house owner personal account wherever cc is accepted i pay via cc just thinking about getting kiwi for the rupay cc primarily to clean up my bank statement of these low value upi transactions not sure if it will work or makes sense in my case due to the case mentioned above\ngot my kiwi card and first statement generated\n\nmy finding\n\n1 they charge 59 on fuel spends so dont use it for fuel for 200rs they charged 1180rs previously did one fuel transaction with icici coral rupay no additional charge was included\n2 after receiving 500 kiwis im not getting any cashback af far i know 2 of your credit limit is the maximum cashback you can get so my credit limit is 25k it means 500rs is my limit but after 132rs around 542 kiwi i havent received any kiwis for 56 payments\n3 op you get flat 2 cashback on scan and pay not on all upi spends\n\n\nanyone interested in applying for kiwi card i can share you my referral link\n\n\nforgot to mention kiwi app gives you additional 20 discount in zomato and swiggy upto 100rs minimum txn value of 399\none downside i have been facing with cc on upi is acceptance many merchants have disabled cc payments via upi because they are being charged mdr i guess things will only get worse with time  given that the govt is now reducing incentives on their digital payment push \n\ni am not sure when but eventually npci will also require to charge mdr on upi maybe for spends beyond a certain

buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite

well in the real world is tough\ni disagree with most of the things in the post \nbut i agree with tech and tech building tools have gotten better and faster and cheaper \nbut you are down playing the effort that is needed to build software products \ni develop apps and websites so it is a little personal to me sorry for the bias\nso things have gotten cheap yes \n510 thousand is the rate you pay for unskilled labour or you exploit hardworking and talented students if you do that or encourage that shame on you \nthere will be a noticeable difference in quality of a 20k app developed in three months by a hardworking intern vs what is done with actual resources who work in the field \nrates are insane and the margin is insane too agreed but that is for big players who churn out quality product and give quality support etc\nyou seem to have a very superficial understanding of how things work here even after 3 years so i am assuming you are from sales and not get involved in the technical execution part more often my advice is to talk to more freelancers firms and even interns compare their work vs what they charge then you will understand where all that extra money goes"}]],"39":[[{"negative":0.8236861825,"neutral":0.040877372,"positive":0.1354364455,"aspect":"zepto","text":"new zepto workflow scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the

might think but broo there are already swiggy zomato zepto in the same business then what are you doing different  but let me tell you we have a completely different usp and strategic advantages over all the rest delivery startups like zomato  swiggy and even if they tried to copy us in the future it would take them at least a year to come close  \n\n\nenough about our startup now lets talk about whats relevant to you\n\n  \nfor our startup we are building our app we have a team of 8 people 2 senior developers and the rest are interns we recently secured funding and are looking to scale weve built version 1 \n\nand launched it on the app store and play store were now working on version 2 and for that were looking for interns with experience in native app development dont close this post even\n\nif you have zero experience in app development bear with me i have something for you \n\n\n\njust let me clear it here  we dont give a single fuck about your cgpa excellence is what we are looking for \n\n\n\nbut before starting out i want to share a quick story about our previous 2 interns that we hired \n\n \n\n3 months ago we hired 2 interns from one of the top college both were girls one had an impressive cv with crazy projects languages and all that while the other had no experience in app development but was asking  for a chance promising she wouldnt disappoint us we hired both and even while they were learning we started their stipend how we searched for them we circulated msgs on their whatsapp college groups however we noticed that the girl with the great cv was missing regular meetings and giving out of the world excuses for it like literal laughable excuses she was doing all the mediocre work nothing special just the bare minimumsometimes not even bare minimum with delayed submissions and all  \n   \nin startups things move fast and you have to learn quickly and adapt she wasnt doing that but on top of that she was always prompt and crazy in reminding us about her stipend on the other hand the second girl who asked for a chance did extremely well\n\n she put in the effort and did what was expected staying on top of her tasks\n\na week ago the first girl with the great cv sent us a message saying she couldnt continue with our startup because she got an opportunity to prepare for gate at iit it was all lie like as usual and she asked us to credit her stipend as she had submitted all her work this whole situation was a lie how did i know because previously she added me on linkedin and yesterday i saw her comment under a linkedin post asking for another internship attaching her cv\n\n\n\ni wont comment further on her but put yourself in my shoes imagine investing time and money in someone and getting this in return\n\n\n\nso this is the exact type of person we dont want to hire we really dont want any internship farmers who aim to do 56 internships just to make their cvs shinner than the moon itself \n\nif thats your goal were not interested\n\n\n\nwhat we want\n\n\n\nwe want some smart individuals who are quick learners people and someone who has done something worthwhile in their life this doesnt have to be a project we dont want another cv decorator who just wants to paint their dry cv with some internships we want people that we can invest in and who will add value to our startup in return \n\n\n\nthis is a paid internship   \n\n\npreviously we offered noconditions paid internships but because of our past experience we just dont want to burn our money\n\n\n\nif you reading this you fall under 2 categories

flipkart axis card for sbi cb and other cb cards\n tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom"}]],"50":[[{"negative":0.5455669165,"neutral":0.2317328304,"positive":0.2227002233,"aspect":"zepto","text":"new zepto scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery

only because a friend referred it to me and till this day ive never used it except to spend zepto cash on something i really need essentials only\n\nand i spend it very carefully i used to get almost 125 daily for a few days then it reduced to 75 so i buy only the stuff that is zepto cash eligible i used it once for the 25 promo and 125 to almost get a free delivery and only buy stuff where im making minimum cutoff amount of 99 and spending the bare minimum \n\ni once just tried to fill the cart with i may or may not need and saw this surge fee where the code leaked not a coder so if someone can make sense of it lemme know ofc i deleted most items later to not spend on it\n\ni dont have their stupid pass subscription because they just want you to activate it to show the investors so i intentionally decline it every time only to see a 1 difference so i just dont buy it \n\ni also dont need any paper bags i have plenty but since im keen on zepto failing like another byjus i specifically untick it to add the bag to my already existing pile of bags\n\ni only order essentials where zepto looses money and use the free cash to pay for it \n\ntill date in a total of 10 orders ive not paid anything more than a total for 200300 max that too because i had friends at home once so yeah a net order spend of 25\n\nso yeah if you hate zepto and really want to see it fail id suggest you follow this strategy\n\ni mean ofc this case is an exception and not the general crowd is like this but i thought ill just put it out in the open for once\n\nand yeah if you want 25 off on your next order upto 200 let me know lol ill send the referral link to you on dm ofc i get something similar too but upto 800 which im sure i wont spend on the app so yeah idk i just want to watch zepto burn\n\nwhy so much hate because i want the vcs behind zepto to realise that burning money isnt gonna get you anywhere principles of business stay the same youre trying to cash out on a greater fool theory only to dump it to dumb retail investors and please your silent partners its sort of an ego thing of forcing zepto to make money by burning money and making aadit a puppet just stop doing this and be real for once this is a really sad post the fact that you would spend this much time to do something that is not constructive to anyone and then would go on to spend the time to write an elaborate post about it boggles my mind is this what you want to spend your mind and time on\n\nand fyi none of what youre doing is even going to put a dent on their business at the end of the day regardless of what some pennycounting redditor thinks of them theyre going to reap the benefits of adding value to their customers \n\ni routinely use zepto and love the app i use it because it adds value to my time and im happy to pay extra for the convenience if my order on zepto is more expensive than me going to buy it in the store because i value my time more than i value the few rupees if it ever becomes so expensive that it starts to feel like a rip off i will find alternatives that work \n\nim never going to invest my time and energy on trying to kill their business \n\nwake up if you think youre even putting a dent on their business youre burning your time for no consequence of value not to you nor anyone\nthis remind me of a scene from the sitcom silicon valley where richard orders bulk of pizzas at once to bankrupt a pizza delivery company as they were losing 5 a pizza haha\n\nbtw why are you so against zepto  i am not a fan or supporter of it and neither have i used it up until nowjust wanna know\nbro is just another jealous person being salty for not being able to make money\n\nare you using an app for the first time that you want the investors to realise that this is not how the business done\n\nand they dont know the value of their money that they can give it for free\n\nthis business model has succeeded in india and thats why they are doing this\n\nwhy is that everyone keeps pissing off from the people who make money\nasli account se aao deepinder goyal\nbro what have zepto founders done to you\n\nare they your

grocery delivery apps  building a solution  so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets

supreme court not being heard the brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform

surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the delivery guy as soon its out for delivery got the food this time still i didnt got my money back yet zomato\n\nive also used blinkit swiggy eatclub zepto it was my first time going through this has anyone faced the same

like we get on amazon myntra and flipkart unless someones enjoying exploiting this loop hole deepinder goyal this happened to me also but i dont think its zomato to blame mojo pizza uses their own

being valued at 100 cr  \n\nthere was a lot of vc funding coming  so valuation game was on  but lately foreign vc funding  has dried up  as most investments are yielding profits  exits are just based in hype based valuations\n\nzepto is a great example  how a company with no unique ip is valued so much  already people are claiming its model is a failure   not scalable those 2 young kids dont have the same charm or intellect that we saw in gates or jobs when they were young lot of these startups are just accidental billionaires  \n\nthe successful entrepreneurs of the west took atleast a decade before they tasted success  whereas in india we are seeing overnight billionaires in an economy with much low per capita gdp consumption \n\nbut how long will this circus last  only till vc funds dry up or when nririch indians stop pumping into this game \n\n i am not doubting the potential of our youngsters or their talent  we are capable  but the new set of heros that are projected arent worth it  my concern is that they dont oversell  fail   making it worse for future entrepreneurs we still have a very good business pan india for example take arun \nwhy indian startups are not able to crack globally is a big question maybe because of lack of creativity once srk said this gurbat me creativity nahi hoti meaning theres no creativeness when youre poor and i personally believe its the reason you see the big companies coming from west all of them had a very good financial background other thing i believe is the rejection of entrepreneurial culture a mass people here still thinks starting a business is a failure of that person \ntimes are changing maybe we can expect something in next decade \npeople are now accepting entrepreneurship is something in india but still we have a long way to go\nindia is kind of late to the technology scene i remember in 19971998 there used to be to 12 computer hardware shops in nehru place while in us dotcom scene was so booming which eventually led to the bubble in 2000 we were so far apart \n\nyou need paypal mafia kind of stories where a few successful companies lead to a few hundred  entrepreneurs over the next 1020 years our startup scene only started in around 2007 it takes a good 1015 years to build a solid foundation yes we lag behind  will continue to lag behind usa but maybe in a decade the gap will be substantially less there are quite a few hidden gems that stay out of news which is good actually\n\ngrey orange pine labs postman chargebee rivigo  and so on\nzoho is an outlier currently another 510 years more and well have more indian startups thatll be used globally\ni think the companies that will turn big and will be there for the long haul are still in their building phase going through their share of grind before they taste success as you mentioned in the west successful entrepreneurs took atleast a decade for that \n\ntake zerodha for example they toiled for so long before bursting in the scene and swooping away a fair share of the market with a valueadded product \n\nanother example would be finshots ditto insurance which started off with making finance accessible to the layman currently working towards making insurance available to everyone excellent product and excellent founders going through their share of the grind before tasting that valuation limelight\n\nim sure there are many hidden gems out there who are not fighting the valuation game which will organically shine when their time comes\nthe current startup scene in india fueled by venture capitalists and the quest for unicorn status is  misguided it fosters a toxic ecosystem where the wealthy fund the wealthy often creating services that inflate prices and cater to unnecessary luxuries rather than solving genuine problems for the middle class zomato byjus and swiggy are classic examples\n\nperhaps a more sustainable approach would be for india to prioritize essential needs before diving headfirst into innovation for niche markets as peter thiel emphasizes in his book zero to one true startups should focus on creating something entirely new not just replicating existing models zoho and zerodha are commendable examples of indian companies that have done just that\n\nindia boasts a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit with a higher proportion of selfemployed individuals than perhaps any other nation except maybe china government and investors should have prioritized established homegrown successes like naga mills haldirams and everest these companies admired internationally for filling genuine gaps represent indias true entrepreneurial strength instead the focus seems to be on lossmaking ventures like ola and swiggy businesses arguably unsuited to the indian markets current needs \n\nperhaps the path forward lies in acknowledging india is a world of its own and identifying the real entrepreneurial spirit and channeling it towards solving problems relevant to its vast population by fostering innovation that addresses genuine needs india can create a startup ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders not just a select few\n\nyall stop being copy

taken up by major players such as social media ig facebook twitter ordering food zomato swiggy ride hailing uber ola namma yatri rapido groceries delivery zepto blinkit etc wanted to know your opinion on what could be ideas for apps which an indian audience would need in todays time theres an app called ground news its relatively new and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication how many times the story has been shared by known conservative or liberal media how each side of the spectrum showsheadlines the news and tries to catch misinformation \nits made in the us and our landscape is quite different to theirs so im not sure how it fares here but something like that for india i think would do well with the younger crowd i personally find it very intriguing \n\nexecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe itll help spark something new\ncan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust  also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the coaching containing video streaming chats question solving etc feature\nhow about an app that compares prizes in real time hailing a ride compare prices from uber vs ola ordering food compare prices from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant similarly for grocery delivery i dont know if any of these platforms have apis that you can utilize for this and that could make this idea a little tricky to implement\nan app to pay all bills in one shot every month\nyou should try faith tech such as astrology applications

discretionary spend and on top of it are too indisciplined to adopt productivity apps let alone pay subscription fees for them furthermore if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is  people spend hours in local trains  buses it is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports betting apps etc looking for instant gratification or quick money neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use

hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid will be able to quickly create tiktok profiles that include artistspecific features like a music tab new releases by artist behind the song fan spotlight ticketing and more\n\ncash app the mobile payment app owned by block is exiting the uk market with plans to close down the app on september 15th the uk was the first international market to receive the peertopeer payments app outside of the us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to

having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company

seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers havent heard of tiktok before and that the push theyve been looking for is a signup link from a fellow creator\n\nin other tiktok news the

informed about these orders and our brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in brazil rather than

advertising policies enforced by google facebook and tiktok in the past year nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature indecent or inappropriate which has resulted in censorship shadow bans and removal of their advertisements this ones tough to judge on one hand i understand where nood is coming from just because their products are made for womens breasts doesnt intrinsically make their products sexual in nature on the other hand some of noods ads are objectively sexualized designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless only to look closer and discover that shes wearing a skin tone nipple cover many users wouldnt consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds and

backup filled that upi rupay void with hdfc tata neu plus my first nonltf card but fyf still i know infinity is better but i am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity\n\nx200b\n\ncredit card bill payments\n\ni am still experimenting here for now with my debit cards axis citi sbi to see which is providing the best net cash conversion from app perspective payments made via paytm have been swift so far though it allows only sbi dc since axis and citi are both mastercard payzapp allows all my dcs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever i have tried this route i am thinking of trying out axis or hdfc native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via dc this month till i find a better option in terms of privacy payment instrument acceptance and reliability i will stick to paytm  sbi dc as my default combo rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria i will settle once i have optimized my dc rewards i have never used cred cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues\n\nx200b\n\nlifestyle expenses\n\nalmost two domestic flights every month homestay bookings prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day as much as possible i prefer to avoid quick commerce  blinkit zepto bb and food deliveries  swiggy zomato and instead go for morningafternoon walks in the park and buy veggiesfruits along my back and whenever i am out at homestays prefer to walk down at least one side to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh this alone results in substantial savings no overpriced buyingconveniencedelivery fees enforces me to remain in shape no need to pay for gym memberships and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle no need to take in vitamin d health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls  much more than any credit card rewards program can offer occoasional fine dining with family 24 times a month  gift cards weekend dining acceleration payment offers on eazydiner zomato dineout usually come in handy shopping on apparels  once or twice a year major family trips  only dometic till now probably once a year along with 23 minor ones to driveable distances may target for a family international trip this calendar year  only if i achieve my investment milestone that i am working upon term health insurance movie theatres  barely 4 in an year  only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over ott other things include  utility fuel autocab big ticket purchases  occasional over some years not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics gadgets appliances\n\nx200b\n\ncredit rating\n\ni have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a lucrative offer avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases of liabilities such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds andor settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs but not all of my wants\n\nx200b\n\nepilogue\n\ni still have mostly ltf cards i remember an amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews updates news hacks and what not for the current and future indian credit card holders i hope the community continues to blossom and i am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments man og citi was great bank  sad they left\nas you have so many ltfs which all banks have tried to charge some random fee fine\nwanna swap cards lol"}]],"168":[[{"negative":0.2724108994,"neutral":0.4471850693,"positive":0.2804040313,"aspect":"zepto","text":"help me pick a stack so im currently a

but adult sites have about 1m users not all active obv currently running on a 3 dedicated servers microservices on aws assets on cloudfronts3 about 12k  concurrent users across timezones \n\nfrontend \n\nfirst thought for frontend was react but react developers about to hate me i really dont think its very seo friendly spongebob meme but google parses js rendered blah blah but i also have a large international userbase so payload size is a big factor \n\ni thought about using it just for the members area which is a obviously a great use case for react the only problem is theres a lot of crossover content from the publicly accessible content and writing it twice is not an option \n\nvuejs  seems to be a possibility and seems possible to get a decently small payload and would be more friendly to ssr which would solve the publicmembers reusability issue so i guess id like some reasons im wrong for this thought process \n\nold school jquerybootstrapsass style obviously super light zepto but been there done that and while its light af and gels with my minimalistic ocd i really like the component based approach with newer frameworks \n\nbackend  \nssr is definitely a major requirement  something that plays nicely with component reusability kinda thinking nestjsnuxt  but there a part of me that really wants to dabble with go id like to use websockets for messagingnotifications and it seems go is a bit better resourcewise for that but it doesnt seem like there are a lot of templating options based on 3 seconds of googling please advise as something like a laravel which i have the added benefit of 20 years of experience in php at least \n\nsonow that ive pissed off every developer here im an open book really trying to look at this with all possibilities im kind of old school i really like minimal dependencies and honestly enjoy building out from the bare metal as much as possible \n\nopen to any and all discussions and debate alll options have pros and cons and id love to hear your opinions on what you would use in my scenario especially ones i havent considered i would recommend sveltekit for the frontend it has good seo features smaller bundles and loads only what is needed on the current page it also has simpler code and generates vanilla javascript from the code\n\nsveltekit is also very good for ssr with the right adapter\n\n\ni think you might find this approach intriguing\nwhats wrong with your phptypescript stack\n\npicking a different stack would bring you different problems\nid check out laravel with htmlx or hybridly vue for laravel"}]],"169":[[{"negative":0.8535377383,"neutral":0.1308258772,"positive":0.015636418,"aspect":"zepto","text":"despite fund raising zepto want to lose customers this is just a

concerns\nyou certainly can i think the issue youll face is attaching the customized fields to the original order meaning say you auto sent them an email as an example and they filled it out on a google doc\n\nyou need that google doc to be attached to the order the product customizer apps usually add product property fields which get pulled into shopify on the actual order\n\nso while you likely can add a form or even a redirect to a form from the thank you page youll be missing these fields in your actual order data\n\nyou might be able to set something up with zapier or api tho to do it and to add a order note or something\n\nps shopify is scheduled to release extensible support for the thank you page for non plus storss sometime this year that will make adding content to the
