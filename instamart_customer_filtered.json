recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to

with his own goals initially it was difficult for him to form the habit but he picked up quickly and was able to continue\n\nafter some days he was always late to the gym i used to pick him up on my way to the gym but he decided that i should not to do it because i made him hurry and i kept bickering about why he kept me waiting outside the door so he asked to stop picking him up because he wanted to workout in a positive  mindset i agreed\n\nlast thursday we had a nasty fight while going to the gym i had picked him up in that day though because he said he was okay with it the fight was about my our families i dont want to go into the details here but his family did something which very disrespectful towards mine i was angry while communicating this and i did make personal remarks about him to which he reacted that he would not workout that and left the gym i tried to stop by holding his hand but he pushed my hands away he left the building and i ran behind him calling out his name but he wont stop long story short we were able to solve the issue that day and come to agreement about what happened\n\nyesterday he had not woken up by the time i left for gym and said would workout in the afternoon he did not we agreed yesterday that he would be on time today but same thing today he did not wake up on time when i called he assured me that he would reach the gym but could not due some issues with his instamart order he was fighting g with customer care for refund i was very furious at this point that he did not take this part seriously the thing is he is always late to everywhere not 5 mins late more like 1 hour late late to gym late to dates and late to family events to the point where my mom had to wait for an hour for him and he still didi not come\n\nwhen i asked him over text he implied that he would not come and come later in the day i called him to confront and it became a very big fight besides all the slurs that we spit out these were the things

having helped me in the beginning but he is pulling back\n\n2 i believe it is extremely important to be on time whatever the place may be unforeseen situations can be understood\n\n3 his place is like 2km away from gym whereas mine is 10km away\n\n4 initially we used to go in the afternoon but there would work calls for both us and we would eventually miss our sessions so we had agreed on doing the

have been levied a fine of 405 rupees and theres no way to contact them the help system only takes me to the chatbot and helpline is busy could anyone suggest what can be done now\n\nupdate thanks a lot for the overwhelming supportive advice guys i ended up on swiggy instamarts customer service who transferred me to another person and so on after 5 transfers finally got in contact with swiggys food team who reversed the fine after i threatened them with the consumer court sadly the taco did turn cold during the process and my craving for fried chicken remains unsatisfied ","25":"dont know

but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process","31":"hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week

discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on zomato and i dont think those are available in every city\n\nbut what about their restaurant app and their support services are their restaurant services significantly different im sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants or are they pretty similar there as well ","36":"i usually dont take complaints to social media but im really frustrated with swiggy instamart and hope sharing this experience might make them take it more seriously or at least warn others \n\nordered hersheys chocolate spread from swiggy instamart but received a packet of milk reported the issue immediately through the apps support sectionno action taken after waiting i had to send a separate email to get any response which took even longer\n\nswiggys response an apology but no refund or replacement just a vague promise to share feedback with the store its frustrating that swiggy expects me to bear this loss and i didnt even get what i paid for i always believed swiggy valued customer experience but this situation has really shaken my trust\n\nhas anyone else faced similar issues with swiggy instamart any advice on escalating this\n\n","37":"never buy books from apps like blinkit or instamart i bought the book norwegian wood three days ago and today when i reached page 154 i found that the pages between 154 and 163 were missing i contacted their customer support and they said the book could be replaced within 24 hours there was no physical damage to the book so how could i have known that pages would be missing from the book\n","38":"yesterday ordered pringles from swiggy instamart but upon delivery i was shocked to find the packet open and half of the chips missing when i raised a complaint i was disappointed by the customer support teams response stating that they were unable to verify my claim and therefore couldnt assist me i was taken aback by their dismissive attitude and lack of concern towards the incidentdid anyone faced such issue ","39":"ordered a bunch of stuff from swiggy instamart at around 1 am the earphones i orders didnt seem to work properly as i tried testing them and they only seemed to work if the aux was inserted in a particular orientation otherwise the sound would be messed up informed the customer support immediately around 56 minutes after the order the earphones still hadnt been even removed from their paper casing still i was told to wait for another 6 hours for a resolution i told the guy that id be leaving the city today as im going home for about a month and it wouldnt be possible for me to return things once im gone he simply told me to wait till 8 am as id have a resolution by then i waited and still hadnt recieved an email i messaged these guys again now they told me they had a technical issue so id have to wait again i wouldnt have been told about said technical issue if i hadnt contacted them the guy had said to me id have a resolution by 8 am but i didnt i was simply lied to i waited another 6 hours again at 2 am im again told they had a technical issue and now ill have to wait 24 hours again i wont even be here in the next 2 hours my experience has been so horrible its crazy these guys dont even bother to listen to you first i get damaged items and now they are fucking up my mind by constantly telling

refund now\n\ni just wanted to share my experience and inform others about their business policies just make sure you guys dont order something expensive from them as they might send you something damaged and later make you run non stop a refund \n\ntldr have been running around for a refund for the past 13 hours while swiggy lies about giving resolution within the next 6 hours and later uses

have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay when i place an instamart order the app takes me to the bank otp screen an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited even order history shows nothing naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same this has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if its a tactic to inflate revenuesales\n\nthe first time it happened i ignore it as an oversight on my part \n\nthe second time after 2 different drivers gave me the same items i contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldnt have accepted the items now we cant do anything\n\nthe 3rd time today the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times this time i made the drivers wait till i got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted mr that if i raise a chat ticket they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money so i let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said  sorry sir you accepted the order so now i cant give you any refund i am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that i was falling in the same situation i have written an email to instamart support but i really think im done with this app\n\nattaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is\n\nwonder if anyone else has gone through this","43":"\nconsistently delivering wrongmissing items on

with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit promotion council of keralavfpck which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable ","47":"hi \n\ni made a purchase of 690 through swiggy instamart for which only 1 cashback was credited when i noticed that merchant name did not have swiggy in it just

get the fee product with it \n\nwhen i contacted support and asked for 50 refund of the product cost or the free product they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never

Not sure what to say\nIts not a scam. I think the powerbank is working fine. If you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left, it is fine.\n20k maH Powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure. Thats all.\nLet me see if I can explain this.\nSee what is the voltage of your powerbank. These are normally 3.7 V. So, the total wattage is 3.7 v * 20000 mah = 3.7 V * 20 Ah = 74 Wh.\n\nPhones operate at 5 V. So, a single full charge of the phone need wattage = 5 V * 4500 mAh = 5 V * 4.5 Ah = 22.5 Wh\n\nSo, number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank = 74 \/ 22.5 = 3.28 times. Considering 10-15% wastage, you will be able to charge it around 2.8 times. So, after 2 charges, if it is having some more charge, then I think that the powerbank is fine. You are expecting too much from the powerbank. You can buy another powerbank from Amazon \/ Flipkart, but you will probably get similar results.\nWhat were your expectations though?\nIt's not a scam, it's working as expected. I think you are misunderstanding how pb works, as many comments have corrected your expectations.","5":"Too brave to make that large order online!\nSend them a final email that if they don't refund you will proceed with legal actions.

You dont have anger issues but may be the added pressure of maintaining the discipline towards losing weight is taking a toll on you . it totally understandable but doesnt excuse bad behaviour on your part as well(Personal comments) \n\n2. you have to ask it yourself if its a deal breaker for you . People are not punctual , its their prerogative. Dont take it personally. But you have to decide if its a non negotiable for you .\n\n3. Yes, you are lucky that your boyfriend supported you initially by going together  but he has a right to do it at his pace and not yours. Separate yourselves from gymming togther atleast for now .\n\n4. No , dont let go , if he really cares for you , he should be on time atleast for important gatherings with family . Thats disrespectful , IMO. \n\nAlso , i think from whatver you have mentioned here in post , you guys are dealing with a lot more than just gym punctuality issues. please have a honest communication with each other . Make each other feel safe and these things can be concluded peacefully .\nYou know he\u2019s not your child right? You don\u2019t have to teach things like disciple to someone who doesn\u2019t want to\nYOU CAN'T FORCE ANYONE TO DO WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO. \n\nYour anger is justified cz he's not punctual. But why depend on someone and then get angry at them. \n\nHe is a non punctual person , which isn't a good trait. Why date someone like him when you're very particular about timings??. Date someone who matches your values. \n\nSecondly, how does he manage other times, like office and meetings, or anything important?? Is he late there too?  If he is, he seriously lacks basic manners. \n\nYou being dependent on someone for your own gym routine is wrong. If u want to have a partner. Talk to someone in the gym only. There may be people who come to gym regularly. \n\nYour boyfriend isn't your child, so stop mothering him by waking him up or reminding him to go to gym. \n\nHe's an adult and he won't do anything according to you. So, don't focus your energy on him, he will drain you all and you'll burn out. \n\nLastly, stop fighting and using slur against each other and running after him after a fight. Talk to each other like adults about your disagreements. It's very childish to runn after him after he barges out of the building. \n\nHe's irresponsible but you keep your calm. And if u aren't happy, please leave.\n\nYou're not wrong in expecting punctuality but he doesn't sound like the one for you.\nbedroom innocent airport sugar soup soft fine flowery bike history\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https:\/\/redact.dev\/home)*\nA gym is a personal matter and anyone can go whenever they want. You can\u2019t force anyone neither to come with you to the gym nor to workout for their health. You\u2019ll just lose relationships by trying to force this\u2026. And I say this as a regular gym goer with 2 years of weight loss journey of over 30 kgs now. At first I used to try and make my friends\/ boyfriend come with me thinking I discovered some big secret about how to look sexy and I\u2019ll help them also to lose weight as well. But then I realized I am just that irritating health freak for them who doesn\u2019t know to respect people\u2019s boundaries and pot bellies. \n\nSo leave the gym aspect and do your own thing. Most people need to develop the willpower to do something in their mind first and then they\u2019ll do it themselves without your prodding","13":"Underconsumption, eh?

When I mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in, would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses AGAIN- through no fault of my own; their responses were flat validations.\n\nI then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if I were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that.\n\nAnd I have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund.\nUnfortunately I am in a city where only instamart is available, if not I always avoid them.\n\nThis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable.\nI don\u2019t know but I use blinkit as instamart isn\u2019t available in my city and blink it\u2019s support is good.","20":"This thread is flaired as \"Serious\".

This is how the supply chain usually works, Farmer -> Wholesaler - > Retailer. Big retailers usually bypass the wholesaler but small retailers need the wholesaler because they can't buy in bulk. Hotels and small tea shops buy from the wholesaler as well. \n\nThe wholesaler looks for just one thing, your consistency in supply. For them, it's a numbers game. More than the price, they focus on moving the goods at a fast pace since their margins are low. If i remember correctly, a kg of banana earns them a profit of around 4-5 rupees. My local wholesaler moves around 3 tons of banana in a day. \n\nYou need to build rapport with them and they will give you a higher price for quality produce.","47":"Exactly same issue \nI got cashback yesterday and for one instamart spend of 1100 Rs I got 11 rs cashback instead of 110!!\nIt was written Instamart Bangalore but didn't had swiggy word\nI've mailed them\nI'll update when I get a reply or refund.","48":"Dont cancel!

Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","9":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

When my mother opened it today to use it. The motor is not working properly. I can't find a way to chat to customer care, all are automated response. What to do now?\nKindly help","12":"May be I need a reality check regarding my own principles Lately I have been working out to lose weight and improve my heart health. My boyfriend joined the gym too, with his own goals. Initially, it was difficult for him to form the habit but he picked up quickly and was able to continue.\n\nAfter some days, he was always late to the gym. I used to pick him up on my way to the gym but he decided that I should not to do it. Because I made him hurry and I kept bickering about why he kept me waiting outside the door. So he asked to stop picking him up because he wanted to workout in a positive  mindset. I agreed.\n\nLast Thursday, we had a nasty fight while going to the gym. I had picked him up in that day though, because he said he was okay with it. The fight was about my our families. I don\u2019t want to go into the details here but his family did something which very disrespectful towards mine. I was angry while communicating this and I did make personal remarks about him. To which he reacted that he would not workout that and left the gym. I tried to stop by holding his hand, but he pushed my hands away. He left the building and I ran behind him, calling out his name but he won\u2019t stop. Long story short, we were able to solve the issue that day and come to agreement about what happened.\n\nYesterday, he had not woken up by the time I left for gym and said would workout in the afternoon. He did not. We agreed yesterday that he would be on time today. But same thing today, he did not wake up on time. When I called he assured me that he would reach the gym but could not due some issues with his Instamart order. He was fighting g with Customer care for refund. I was very furious at this point that he did not take this part seriously. The thing is he is always late, to everywhere. Not 5 mins late. More like 1 hour late. Late to gym, late to dates and late to family events to the point where my mom had to wait for an hour for him and he still didi not come.\n\nWhen I asked him over text, he implied that he would not come and come later in the day. I called him to confront and it became a very big fight. Besides all the slurs that we spit out, these were the things that he said:\n\n1. He will come to gym whenever he wants because that is what the subscription offers\n2. I am no one to decide when he should come\n3. He is adjusting his day by waking up early for gym. It is his choice not to wake up so early.\n\nSome extra context:\n\n1. It was very difficult for me to start my fitness journey. I needed a gym partner who I can rely on. I am thankful to my boyfriend for having helped me in the beginning. But he is pulling back.\n\n2. I believe it is extremely important to be on time, whatever the place may be. Unforeseen situations can be understood.\n\n3. His place is like 2km away from gym whereas mine is 10km away.\n\n4. Initially we used to go in the afternoon but there would work calls for both us and we would eventually miss our sessions. So, we had agreed on doing the morning because there no work calls in the morning.\n\n5. He has been to the gym by himself only once but has never completed a routine.\n\nWhy I am writing this?\n\n1. I want to understand if it alright feel this angry or do I have anger issues.\n\n2. Is my belief of punctuality a facade?\n\n3. Am I being too needy by depending on my boyfriend for support in this case?\n\n4. Should I just let go everytime he is late and say nothing? Is that the right thing to do?","13":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 29th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n___\n\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce, emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against ReviewServiceUSA.com for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","14":"What am I understanding wrong in the Indian Consumer Protection Act 2019 I ordered some stuff via swiggy instamart. They delivered partial order. I said I want to return the order and they are refusing it. \n\nNow I read some stuff online and made assessment that what they are doing is illegal but I am also in doubt that maybe my understanding is having a gap because I am not expecting someone like swiggy to be so open about doing something illegal.\n\nPoint to notice \n1. I raised the issue as soon as I ordered\n2. I have not opened packaging\n3. Their customer care was not able to tell me how they deserve a right to refuse my return\n4. I did not receive a complete order but was refunded for the missing items but I want either complete order or nothing","15":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","16":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 29th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ShopifyeCommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...  \n___\n\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n\n___\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce (formerly Woo, formerly WooCommerce), emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against [ReviewServiceUSA.com](http:\/\/ReviewServiceUSA.com) for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate [Alibaba.com](http:\/\/Alibaba.com), the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\n hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nFor more details on each story and sources, see the full edition:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/searchgpt-pinterest-allegations-woocommerces-future\/\n\nWhat else is new in e-commerce?\n\nShare stories of interesting in the comments below (including in your own business) or on r\/shopifreaks.\n\n-PAUL\nEditor of Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: Want the full editions delivered to your Inbox each week? Join free at www.shopifreaks.com","17":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

TLDR: Frustrated of being defrauded by Swiggy Instamart of substandard and underweight produce. Their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices. will a consumer courts complaint help me get what I paid for?\n\nFeel cheated every time I order from Swiggy Instamart for the sake of convivence, Mutiple times They have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce, supplied to them on their store by third party vendors. Moreover, they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat. they ask you to email them proofs (to save server costs) and when supported by photo\/video evidence they dismiss the issue by stating, they are unable to \" validate\" my claims and refuse to replace even, forget refunding.  \n\n\nEvery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items, where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up.   \nHow is it that I have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check, it's like i am paying to give my feedback every time. Nothing changes and they continue on their merry way.    \n\n\nI am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if I am luck. I understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks, but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense.   \n\n\nA simple transaction of getting what I paid for as consumer shouldn't be such a gamble, Swiggy Instamart feels like a micro-gambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to \"the (un) concerned team\" and a take home a promise to of it being \" never repeated again in the future\".  \n\n\nI have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months.   On principle, i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company.  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers, it not a small amount. I wish we had class action lawsuits in our country.   \n1. Is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on National Consumer helpline portal online?  \n2. will my emails to Swiggy's Customer care team be considered as a legal notice, wherein I've mentioned it to be considered as such?","20":"I got threatened by a swiggy instamart guy This guy started talking rudely the minute he called me to ask about the address.

I ended up on swiggy instamart's customer service who transferred me to another person and so on.

The delivery parner came but only had the Cup noddles, I asked about the Pepsi and lays, he had no idea about it. He said to ask the customer service. Now I've heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so don't know how to ask, I'm really confused, what do do?

I've used various cards in the past, including HSBC, HDFC, and Amex, but I canceled most of them around 2019, keeping only one HDFC and Citibank card for increased financial discipline. My main card is the HDFC Regalia Gold. As an Imperia customer, I purposely keep the credit limit 'limited' and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f. The Citi card moved to Axis, which I use as my 'beat-up card' in places where I'm not comfortable using the premium card, keeping its limit below 1L. So, just these 2 cards and all the points go to Regalia gold and use in Smartbuy for all my guilt spends, flights etc\n\nRecently noticed that, I need an ICICI card, SBI card as these are preferred by many e-comm sites for discounts.\n\n**My Details:**\n\n* **Credit Score:**\u00a0835 (Experian), 844 (CRIF) as per CRED\n* **Current Credit Cards:**\u00a0HDFC Regalia Gold, Axis Rupay (UPI enabled)\n* **Annual ITR (last 3 years):**\u00a0Avg INR 80L+\n\n**SBI Cashback Card:**\u00a0(Got *Rejected!*)\n\nBeing an SBI customer for over two decades with a Platinum profile, I saw a 'pre-approved' credit card offer on the online SBI site. After logging in, I completed the online application and KYC using Digilocker data. Despite receiving an email from Aadhar confirming successful KYC, the SBI card site didn't respond. The next day, an SBI card agent called, and someone came to my address for KYC. After filling out a paper form and taking my picture, the KYC was done. However, my application was later rejected. Being in the top 0.1% of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by SBI\u2014guess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club! Now I understand the grin on MS Dhoni's face when he says  \"Jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\"\ud83d\ude06\n\n**HDFC Swiggy Card:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nI applied for this card through HDFC net banking. The online KYC process was smooth, with no physical verification needed. I received the HDFC Swiggy Cashback card in 3-4 days. Since we order a lot on Swiggy, Instamart, and Zomato, this card will replace my other cards for online transactions.\n\n**ICICI HPCL Super Saver:**\u00a0\u00a0(Approved)\n\nWith no prior relationship with ICICI, I applied for this card directly on their site. I chose this card because I spend around 6-7K monthly on HPCL fuel. ICICI cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to HDFC. The application process was smooth, with an option for Video KYC. Despite some initial issues with browser compatibility, the KYC was completed successfully using Google Chrome. The application was approved the next day, and I received the card in 3 days. I promptly disabled Chrome afterward!\n\n**Learnings**:\n\n1. **Digital Efficiency**: HDFC stands out for its smooth, fully online process, setting a benchmark for digital efficiency.\n2. **Customer Experience**: ICICI's process was also efficient, though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues. Their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3. **Service Gaps**: SBI needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses, the overall experience has been enlightening. It's clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customer-centric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process.","31":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Sep 2nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants, raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions.

Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing.

The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants**,** raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

As a customer their app doesn't feel very differentiated to me. If either of them do something new the other also soon gets there. Discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time. (Right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on Zomato and I don't think those are available in every city).\n\nBut what about their restaurant app and their support services? Are their restaurant services significantly different? I'm sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts, depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants? Or are they pretty similar there as well? ","36":"Disappointed with Swiggy Instamart Support I usually don't take complaints to social media, but I'm really frustrated with Swiggy Instamart and hope sharing this experience might make them take it more seriously or at least warn others. \n\nOrdered Hershey\u2019s chocolate spread from Swiggy Instamart but received a packet of milk. Reported the issue immediately through the app\u2019s support section\u2014no action taken. After waiting, I had to send a separate email to get any response, which took even longer.\n\nSwiggy\u2019s response? An apology but no refund or replacement, just a vague promise to \"share feedback with the store.\" It\u2019s frustrating that Swiggy expects me to bear this loss, and I didn\u2019t even get what I paid for. I always believed Swiggy valued customer experience, but this situation has really shaken my trust.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues with Swiggy Instamart? Any advice on escalating this?\n\n","37":"Never buy books from blinkit and instamart Never buy books from apps like Blinkit or Instamart. I bought the book Norwegian Wood three days ago, and today, when I reached page 154, I found that the pages between 154 and 163 were missing. I contacted their customer support, and they said the book could be replaced within 24 hours. There was no physical damage to the book, so how could I have known that pages would be missing from the book?\n","38":"Half eaten food delivered  Yesterday ordered Pringles from Swiggy Instamart, but upon delivery, I was shocked to find the packet open and half of the chips missing. When I raised a complaint, I was disappointed by the customer support team's response, stating that they were unable to verify my claim and therefore couldn't assist me. I was taken aback by their dismissive attitude and lack of concern towards the incident.Did anyone faced such issue .","39":"Scammed by Swiggy Instamart  Ordered a bunch of stuff from Swiggy Instamart at around 1 am. The earphones I orders didn't seem to work properly as I tried testing them and they only seemed to work if the aux was inserted in a particular orientation otherwise the sound would be messed up. Informed the customer support immediately around 5-6 minutes after the order. The earphones still hadn't been even removed from their paper casing, still I was told to wait for another 6 hours for a \"resolution\" I told the guy that I'd be leaving the city today as I'm going home for about a month and it wouldn't be possible for me to return things once I'm gone. He simply told me to wait till 8 am as I'd have a resolution by then. I waited and still hadn't recieved an email. I messaged these guys again. Now, they told me they had a \"technical issue\" so I'd have to wait again. I wouldn't have been told about said \"technical issue\" if I hadn't contacted them. The guy had said to me I'd have a resolution by 8 am but I didn't. I was simply lied to. I waited another 6 hours again. At 2 am I'm again told they had a \"technical issue\" and now I'll have to wait 24 hours again. I won't even be here in the next 2 hours. My experience has been so horrible it's crazy. These guys don't even bother to listen to you. First I get damaged items and now they are fucking up my mind by constantly telling me to wait and run for a refund. Each time they told that they have \"highlighted the issue to their team\" but they are simply lying. I'd never be ordering from these guys again. I've given up on getting a refund now.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience and inform others about their business policies. Just make sure you guys don't order something expensive from them as they might send you something damaged and later make you run non stop a refund. \n\nTLDR: have been running around for a refund for the past 13 hours while Swiggy lies about giving resolution within the next 6 hours and later uses \"technical issues\" (again and again) as an excuse to make me wait longer and longer, so I give up on the refund. ","40":"New Zepto Scam? Is this a joke?\n\nWhen you have a pass for any grocery app, the delivery charge is waived off by default when it\u2019s applicable. \n\nZepto used to waive the delivery fee by the default until recently, they\u2019ve started giving an option to waive it off. I don\u2019t see such a thing with Instamart. \n\nShouldn\u2019t Zepto minus the delivery fee by default? \nTheir customer support is arrogant as usual when you reach out.\n\nAnyone else who faced this?\n","41":"Ordered food items from instamart, recieved an Adidas T-Shirt instead. So, at 2:02am, I ordered ice cream, mixed peanuts & banana cakes from Instamart. It was showing \"Arriving in 19 minutes\" at first. Around 15 mins later, I checked my phone and saw \"Arriving in 3 minutes\". But no delivery partner was assigned. I waited for 5 mins, and saw the minute count got refreshed to 15. Okay. After 7 mins or so, a delivery partner was assigned. A few minutes later, he came, handed me the package, and I carried it inside. As I was opening the package, I felt odd because I had ordered ice cream. But I didn't feel anything cold inside the package. To my surprise there was a black sports t-shirt. I opened the wrapper and saw the logo ADIDAS. Wow. I've always had very good experience as an instamart user. It irked me at first, because I wanted some ice cream. But now, I don't even know what I'm supposed to feel about this. I had a good laugh. Haven't contacted customer support yet. \n\n","42":"Scam Alert - Post IPO shady observations Hi guys,\n\nApologies if the title seems childish but I don't know how to feel right now. Swiggy has looted me for the 3rd time with the same excuse.\n\nI have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay. When I place an instamart order, the app takes me to the bank otp screen, an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited. Even order history shows nothing, naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed, lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same. This has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if it's a tactic to inflate revenue\/sales.\n\nThe first time it happened I ignore it as an oversight on my part. \n\nThe second time, after 2 different drivers gave me the same items I contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldn't have accepted the items now we cant do anything.\n\nThe 3rd time (today) the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times. This time I made the drivers wait till I got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted Mr that if I raise a chat ticket, they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money. So, I let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said \" Sorry sir you accepted the order so now I can't give you any refund\". I am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that I was falling in the same situation. I have written an email to instamart support but I really think I'm done with this app.\n\nAttaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is.\n\nWonder if anyone else has gone through this.","43":"Swiggy stoops to new low \nConsistently delivering wrong\/missing items on instamart.\nNow even the customer support auto closed the chat asking to write an email to customer support.\nThis must be intentional as a lot of customers won't notice missing\/lower priced replacements. You need to have some level of accountability when you cheat your customers in broad daylight.\n\nBetter shut down your business and go rob people Swiggy!\n\nNever ordering on Swiggy again. Blinkit and Bigbasket are miles ahead.","44":"I got my LTF CC scratch card on Swiggy, and they said, \u201cNot for you.\u201d This morning, I ordered a few items from Instamart and received a scratch card saying \"LTF Swiggy CC.\" However, after scanning the QR code, it showed \"FYF\" on the Swiggy app. I contacted customer support, and their response was, It\u2019s not for you; it was our mistake to send you that card.

For context not a full time farmer but since my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement, he ventured into farming(which actually keeps him happy as well). \n\nHave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use. I help him whenever I'm back home. \n\nHome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market. A whole difference in taste and freshness. \n\nAs we can't consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family, we try to sell them outside. \n\nThe problem like everyone knows is the price.\n\nHere's how our experience have been so far:\n\n1)Neighbours: There are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but can't take away larger quantities. \n\n2) Small shops: Some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low, they too purchase small quantity. Then there are shops that lowball us. I mean sure they get stuff from TN sprayed with God knows what, cheaply. Obviously we can't match their price. \n\n3) Larger shops are a whole different level. They are happy to take our produce but won't give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically. Post unloading, they give low ball offer. At this stage, we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away. \n\nHave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences. They give us rural rates and sell at urban prices. I wouldn't like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce, those are the ones. \n\n4) Apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface. They charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them. They won't let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer. They also charge higher commissions(not reasonable). Their back end support system is bad too. They often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints, it gets deducted from us. (The customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it). \n\n5) Farming societies don't operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent. \n\n6) Local markets: Here too the goods get loaded are from other states. Getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce. \n\nTo see how crazy the price(particularly when horticrops don't have MRP) is, sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for Rs35 a kg(initially offered Rs30). \n\nA quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of Rs75 a kg(this after crossing out Rs99). \ud83d\ude02\n\nNow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience. And how much the farmer earns from it. \n\nWe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do. \n\nEverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers, but nothing actually flows down. \n\nCan't really compete with the TN produce. But without encouraging farming in our state, we are putting our state food security at risk. What happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams? \n\nI've heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee, so people buy goods produced in our state. But I've not seen any. \n\nWhile govt spends money on apps for activities like OTT, ride sharing(not functional now) and others, why isn't a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing. \n\nThere is a Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council of Kerala(VFPCK) which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable.

enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso you cannot do much in this case what the card classifies for the

reality check regarding my own principles lately i have been working out to lose weight and improve my heart health my boyfriend joined the gym too with his own goals initially it was difficult for him to form the habit but he picked up quickly and was able to continue\n\nafter some days he was always late to the gym i used to pick him up on my way to the gym but he decided that i should not to do it because i made him hurry and i kept bickering about why he kept me waiting outside the door so he asked to stop picking him up because he wanted to workout in a positive  mindset i agreed\n\nlast thursday we had a nasty fight while going to the gym i had picked him up in that day though because he said he was okay with it the fight was about my our families i dont want to go into the details here but his family did something which very disrespectful towards mine i was angry while communicating this and i did make personal remarks about him to which he reacted that he would not workout that and left the gym i tried to stop by holding his hand but he pushed my hands away he left the building and i ran behind him calling out his name but he wont stop long story short we were able to solve the issue that day and come to agreement about what happened\n\nyesterday he had not woken up by the time i left for gym and said would workout in the afternoon he did not we agreed yesterday that he would be on time today but same thing today he did not wake up on time when i called he assured me that he would reach the gym but could not due some issues with his instamart order he was fighting g with customer care for refund i was very furious at this point that he did not take this part seriously the thing is he is always late to everywhere not 5 mins late more like 1 hour late late to gym late to dates and late to family events to the point where my mom had to wait for an hour for him and he still didi not come\n\nwhen i asked him over text he implied that he would not come and come later in the day i called him to confront and it became a very big fight besides all the slurs that we spit out these were the things that he said\n\n1 he will come to gym whenever he wants because that is what the subscription offers\n2 i am no one to decide when he should come\n3 he is adjusting his day by waking up early for gym it is his choice not to wake up so early\n\nsome extra context\n\n1 it was very difficult for me to start my fitness journey i needed a gym partner who i can rely on i am thankful to my boyfriend for having helped me in the beginning but he is pulling back\n\n2 i believe it is extremely important to be on time whatever the place may be unforeseen situations can be understood\n\n3 his place is like 2km away from gym whereas mine is 10km away\n\n4 initially we used to go in the afternoon but there would work calls for both us and we would eventually miss our sessions so we had agreed on doing the morning because there no work calls in the morning\n\n5 he has been to the gym by himself only once but has never completed a routine\n\nwhy i am writing this\n\n1 i want to understand if it alright feel this angry or do i have anger issues\n\n2 is my belief of punctuality a facade\n\n3 am i being too needy by depending on my boyfriend for support in this case\n\n4 should i just let go everytime he is late and say nothing is that the right thing to do 1 you dont have anger issues but may be the added pressure of maintaining the discipline towards losing weight is taking a toll on you  it totally understandable but doesnt excuse bad behaviour on your part as wellpersonal comments \n\n2 you have to ask it yourself if its a deal breaker for you  people are not punctual  its their prerogative dont take it personally but you have to decide if its a non negotiable for you \n\n3 yes you are lucky that your boyfriend supported you initially by going together  but he has a right to do it at his pace and not yours separate yourselves from gymming togther atleast for now \n\n4 no  dont let go  if he really cares for you  he should be on time atleast for important gatherings with family  thats disrespectful  imo \n\nalso  i think from whatver you have mentioned here in post  you guys are dealing with a lot more than just gym punctuality issues please have a honest communication with each other  make each other feel safe and these things can be concluded peacefully \nyou know hes not your child right you dont have to teach things like disciple to someone who doesnt want to\nyou cant force anyone to do what they dont want to \n\nyour anger is justified cz hes not punctual but why depend on someone and then get angry at them \n\nhe is a non punctual person  which isnt a good trait why date someone like him when youre very particular about timings date someone who matches your values \n\nsecondly how does he manage other times like office and meetings or anything important is he late there too  if he is he seriously lacks basic manners \n\nyou being dependent on someone for your own gym routine is wrong if u want to have a partner talk to someone in the gym only there may be people who come to gym regularly \n\nyour boyfriend isnt your child so stop mothering him by waking him up or reminding him to go to gym \n\nhes an adult and he wont do anything according to you so dont focus your energy on him he will drain you all and youll burn out \n\nlastly stop fighting and using slur against each other and running after him after a fight talk to each other like adults about your disagreements its very childish to runn after him after he barges out of the building \n\nhes irresponsible but you keep your calm and if u arent happy please leave\n\nyoure not wrong in expecting punctuality but he doesnt sound like the one for you\nbedroom innocent airport sugar soup soft fine flowery bike history\n\n this post was mass deleted and anonymized with redact\na gym is a personal matter and anyone can go whenever they want you cant force anyone neither to come with you to the gym nor to workout for their health youll just lose relationships by trying to force this and i say this as a regular gym goer with 2 years of weight loss journey of over 30 kgs now at first i used to try and make my friends boyfriend come with me thinking i discovered some big secret about how to look sexy and ill help them also to lose weight as well but then i realized i am just that irritating health freak for them who doesnt know to respect peoples boundaries and pot bellies \n\nso leave the gym aspect and do your own thing most people need to develop the willpower to do something in their mind first and then theyll do it themselves without your prodding","13":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25

their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices will a consumer courts complaint help me get what i paid for\n\nfeel cheated every time i order from swiggy instamart for the sake of convivence mutiple times they have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense   \n\n\na simple transaction of getting what i paid for as consumer shouldnt be such a gamble swiggy instamart feels like a microgambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to the un concerned team and a take home a promise to of it being  never repeated again in the future  \n\n\ni have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months   on principle i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers it not a small amount i wish we had class action lawsuits in our country   \n1 is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on national consumer helpline portal online  \n2 will my emails to swiggys customer care team be considered as a legal notice wherein ive mentioned it to be considered as such wow such empty much first world problem\nop any update \nhi op i just faced the same issue in my case the product was half eaten \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ni recently had a horrible experience with instamarts customer care service and this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies i had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire rooms electrical input when i plugged it in the rest of the house was fine \n\ni ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no fault of my own their responses were flat validations\n\ni then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if i were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that\n\nand i have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund\nunfortunately i am in a city where only instamart is available if not i always avoid them\n\nthis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable\ni dont know but i use blinkit as instamart isnt available in my city and blink its support is good","20":"i got threatened by a swiggy instamart guy this guy started talking rudely the minute he called me to ask about the address i was exhausted from office and really didnt have the patience for it so i gave back the rudeness to him i dont think rudeness is the right english word for badtameezi but anyway\n\nhe comes to deliver the order at my door i send my brother to get it  i live with him this guy asks my brother to call me and then starts picking a fight with me in the same rude tone that

cup noddles i asked about the pepsi and lays he had no idea about it he said to ask the customer service now ive heard that their customer service is not helpful at all and it was a freebee so dont know how to ask im really confused what do do how to inform swiggy \ndont take it in the wrong way i didnt ask them to offer anything free but if you do promse pls do send it really hurts\ud83d\ude2d

stockif there is no stock then why add it to my cart lol also this happened during covid  sometimes they do send the freebies but delivery partners steal them customer service is not helpful in these cases also\ntried instamart once i had ordered chips coke and fews icecreams got the notification that it is delivered but i did not receive it i called the delivery guy he was rude and said that he delivered it to someone and now its not his responsibility he did not even check whether it was me like atleast ask for the name or crosscheck or something \nhad to call the helpdesk 3 times for them to initiate another delivery and even then there were no icecreams so called them again and just told them to refund the amount of the icecreams all of this took more than 3 hours now i use zepto and always opt for pay on delivery","27":"revamping my wallet experience of applying new cards hdfc icici sbi after many years i decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet ive used various cards in the past including hsbc hdfc and amex but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process just one question with an 80l  annual income  why are you applying for cards like swiggy hdfc instead of just upgrading your regalia gold to infinia \nim more interested to know what you do for a living\ncrif  exeperian are secondary primarily only cibil is checked by the banks\nit seems like you ownrun a business banks prefer salaried employees in comparison with business people even if business people file for higher itr \n\n  \nanyways what the your 3 major spend category or maybe tell us platform \n\n  \nbut in general i will recommend you hsbc live 10 on zomato dining in and dmart 15 all other but ignore if you only use swiggy since you already have hdfc swiggy amazon icic or axis fk depending on the platform you shop from kotak myntra if you shop from myntra axis airtel if you have airtel broadband or sim \n\n  \nso with the card you already have and if you add any of the above mentioned cards you have covered lounge access amazon or fk shoppping food deliverydine in utility payments myntra shopping 5 on most online spents using swiggy card upi card groceries shopping at dmart and miscellaneous offline payments\n1 an 80l earner preferring minor cashback over major rewards seems counterintuitive  \n2 to experience a better version of sbi apply for their aurum comes with great lifestyle benefits  \n3 your icici card is a cobranded one these often dont get the respective discounts that the core cards get","31":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25 week of

them do something new the other also soon gets there discounts also at various times are higher on one platform and on another at some other time right now for me the major differentiation is probably instamart on swiggy and everyday on zomato and i dont think those are available in every city\n\nbut what about their restaurant app and their support services are their restaurant services significantly different im sure both of them at different times go after increasing commissions and discounts depending on what their business goals are but long term service might have some constants or are they pretty similar there as well  things as basic as changing riders for orders at swiggy are a nightmare they simply cannot change riders for an order unless the rider himselfherself gets that done \n\ndiscounts are a burden at this stage you cannot do without them but you also cannot do with them \n\ninflation takes away a bigger chunk from our pockets every year","36":"disappointed with swiggy instamart support i usually dont take complaints to social media but im really frustrated with swiggy instamart and hope sharing this experience might make them take it more seriously or at least warn others \n\nordered hersheys chocolate spread from swiggy instamart but received a packet of milk reported the issue immediately through the apps support sectionno action taken after waiting i had to send a separate email to get any response which took even longer\n\nswiggys response an apology but no refund or replacement just a vague promise to share feedback with the store its frustrating that swiggy expects me to bear this loss and i didnt even get what i paid for i always believed swiggy valued customer experience but this situation has really shaken my trust\n\nhas anyone else faced similar issues with swiggy instamart any advice on escalating this\n\n if youre willing enough then go to consumer court that or a social media outrage\ni have encountered similar situations had to reach out to customer service several times to ensure i received the refund amount i relentlessly contacted them until i got my refund\norder milk instead and get hersheys \ud83d\ude09\ni usually get refunds btw i am almost a regular customer\nif you used a credit card for payment contact your bank to start a chargeback process provide them with all the relevant transaction details ensuring your request is officially recorded also ask for a request or case number for your reference  \ni know this may sound petty but if they are going to take your money let them work for it","37":"never buy books from blinkit and instamart never buy books from apps like blinkit or instamart i bought the book norwegian wood three days ago and today when i reached page 154 i found that the pages between 154 and 163 were missing i contacted their customer support and they said the book could be replaced within 24 hours there was no physical damage to the book so how could i have known that pages would be missing from the book\n murakami try not to describe a womans breast challenge impossible\nthis happens on amazon too i have seen reviews where people complained about missing pages also saw similar comments on amazon us too\nthey want you to imagine \nisnt it fault from publisher end\ud83e\udd14\nhappened to me on amazon i guess its just about luck what youre gonna get when ordering books online too many fake publishers out there btw good choice norwegian wood is one of my favorites but dont get your hopes up for other titles from murakami based on this book alone as this one is a lot different than his original style which is creepy and crappy imo hope you enjoy this one though","38":"half eaten food delivered  yesterday ordered pringles from swiggy instamart but upon delivery i was shocked to find the packet open and half of the chips missing when i raised a complaint i was disappointed by the customer support teams response stating that they were unable to verify my claim and therefore couldnt assist me i was taken aback by their dismissive attitude and lack of concern towards the incidentdid anyone faced such issue  i am surprised that you got any chips\nwe cant verify your claim   \ncan confirm to have faced it even for missing items and not get refunded\nswiggy has no customer service seems they have shut it down\nyou can just hope your order goes all well any problem they will just say cannot validate claim and end the conversation\ndelete the app rate 1 star on play store post on twitter\nyou must have paid through digital mode right if so dispute the transaction by raising a chargeback","39":"scammed by swiggy instamart  ordered a bunch of stuff from swiggy instamart at around 1 am the earphones i orders didnt seem to work properly as i tried testing them and they only seemed to work if the aux was inserted in a particular orientation otherwise the sound would be messed up informed the customer support immediately around 56 minutes after the order the earphones still hadnt been even removed from their paper casing still i was told to wait for another 6 hours for a resolution i told the guy that id be leaving the city today as im going home for about a month and it wouldnt be possible for me to return things once im gone he simply told me to wait till 8 am as id have a resolution by then i waited and still hadnt recieved an email i messaged these guys again now they told me they had a technical issue so id have to wait again i wouldnt have been told about said technical issue if i hadnt contacted them the guy had said to me id have a resolution by 8 am but i didnt i was simply lied to i waited another 6 hours again at 2 am im again told they had a technical issue and now ill have to wait 24 hours again i wont even be here in the next 2 hours my experience has been so horrible its crazy these guys dont even bother to listen to you first i get damaged items and now they are fucking up my mind by constantly telling me to wait and run for a refund each time they told that they have highlighted the issue to their team but they are simply lying id never be ordering from these guys again ive given up on getting a refund now\n\ni just wanted to share my experience and inform others about their business policies just make sure you guys dont order something expensive from them as they might send you something damaged and later make you run non stop a refund \n\ntldr have been running around for a refund for the past 13 hours while swiggy lies about giving resolution within the next 6 hours and later uses technical issues again and again as an excuse to make me wait longer and longer so i give up on the refund  file a case\n\n\nits not about the money\n\n\nfile a case\nedit got a refund after i ended up bashing out at the service agent unfortunately\ni think one of the issues is a lack of trust i know a guy in my office who regularly orders stuff and food online and talks to customer care then gets a refund \nunfortunately they have to be more stringent about it im also certainly not defending the fact that these guys gave you a specific and didnt hold up to it its annoying when these ecommerce websites do this\neven i faced similar issues with refund they just make you send them mails and deny refund in the end\nsend an email to grievancesswiggyin they respond to issues","40":"new zepto scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by default when its applicable \n\nzepto used to waive the delivery fee by the default until recently theyve started giving an option to waive it off i dont see such a thing with instamart \n\nshouldnt zepto minus the delivery fee by default \ntheir customer support is arrogant as usual when you reach out\n\nanyone else who faced this\n they prey on the negligence of the people \ud83e\udd21\nnot zepto user but if there are limited free delivery on pass then this button is valid else they are just trying to loot extra money\nits a common dark pattern found in videogames that have predatory practices  you still have to hit apply on free delivery after paying for the pass many would forget to do that someone should drag them to court over it or drag their name through mud for them to make it a default option for pass holders \n\nfuckers are learning terrible things from big gaming companies this practice will be adopted by other apps too if these greedy idiots arent shamed enough\nzepto is ruining its name by introducing new features\nlmao what is handling fee if they are charging delivery fee","41":"ordered food items from instamart recieved an adidas tshirt instead so at 202am i ordered ice cream mixed peanuts  banana cakes from instamart it was showing arriving in 19 minutes at first around 15 mins later i checked my phone and saw arriving in 3 minutes but no delivery partner was assigned i waited for 5 mins and saw the minute count got refreshed to 15 okay after 7 mins or so a delivery partner was assigned a few minutes later he came handed me the package and i carried it inside as i was opening the package i felt odd because i had ordered ice cream but i didnt feel anything cold inside the package to my surprise there was a black sports tshirt i opened the wrapper and saw the logo adidas wow ive always had very good experience as an instamart user it irked me at first because i wanted some ice cream but now i dont even know what im supposed to feel about this i had a good laugh havent contacted customer support yet \n\n some poor soul is gonna get food items instead of an adidas t shirt\nbut do you need it it is useless if you dont like it dont need it  cant resell it\naisa mere sath kyu nhi hota\nnews

i dont know how to feel right now swiggy has looted me for the 3rd time with the same excuse\n\ni have a swiggy credit card which is linked to auto pay when i place an instamart order the app takes me to the bank otp screen an otp arrives and the app resets back to instamart home page showing your cart as is and not showing any order placed or money debited even order history shows nothing naturally you think the order failed and you place it again and then the order gets placed lo and behold 2 drivers arrive with the same order and you realize the first order got placed and your money got cut without a notification but the app never updated you about the same this has weirdly only started happening after swiggy went public making me wonder if its a tactic to inflate revenuesales\n\nthe first time it happened i ignore it as an oversight on my part \n\nthe second time after 2 different drivers gave me the same items i contacted swiggy support and was told that you shouldnt have accepted the items now we cant do anything\n\nthe 3rd time today the glitch happened again and the order got placed 3 times this time i made the drivers wait till i got swiggy support on call after a struggle where support grunted mr that if i raise a chat ticket they will arrange a reverse pick up and refund me my money so i let the drivers go and raised a chat ticket that led to a phone call with a different agent who said  sorry sir you accepted the order so now i cant give you any refund i am really sick of these predatory practices and also my inability to recognize that i was falling in the same situation i have written an email to instamart support but i really think im done with this app\n\nattaching a few chat screenshot to show how hopeless their customer support is\n\nwonder if anyone else has gone through this rwildlyinfuriating\nfile a chargeback with hdfc\nzomato did the same a while ago \nthey now handle the customer complaints over email\nuninstalled

lifestyle with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit promotion council of keralavfpck which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable  vegetable wholesalers \u0d28 \u0d38\u0d2e\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d1a \u0d28\u0d15\u0d15\u0d2f bulk \u0d06\u0d2f tn farm produce \u0d35\u0d19\u0d19\u0d28\u0d28 \u0d1f\u0d38\npalayamkodan ivide 45rskilo so nadan nalla rate kittendathu aanu\nfor produce like bananas there is a local wholesaler this is how the supply chain usually works farmer  wholesaler   retailer big retailers usually bypass the wholesaler but small retailers need the wholesaler because they cant buy in bulk hotels and small tea shops buy from the wholesaler as well \n\nthe wholesaler looks for just one thing your consistency in supply for them its a numbers game more than the price they focus on moving the goods at a fast pace since their margins are low if i remember correctly a kg of banana earns them a profit of around 45 rupees my local wholesaler moves around 3 tons of banana in a day \n\nyou need to build rapport with them and they will give you a higher price for quality produce","47":"hdfc swiggy cashback query hi \n\ni made a purchase of 690 through swiggy instamart for which only 1 cashback was credited when i noticed that merchant name did not have swiggy

\nafter charging my 4500 mah phone two times the battery has drained to one led light which indicates battery level to be 0 to 25\ni ordered from insta mart because it said there is a 4 day return window and in case of anything we can get it replaced today is only day 2 and when i raised a request on their app i was not able to get to the point where i swiggy offers to talk to a customer executive\ni was instead cut off with bot replies asking me to email them will be attaching screenshots below \n\nonce i email them i got a reply saying they are sad that neither refund or replacement can be done\nno reason is mentioned as to why\nim not able to raise further requests on the app also\nthen i tried instagram and i one shit reply saying my feedback is forwarded \nhow is this feedback im saying my product is defective and this is the reply\ni think they have closed their call services also\n\nnow as i was writing i got a reply on instagram asking me to contact the seller \nwhy i am well within the 4 day replacement time frame so why should i contact the seller\n\nim planning to take this up to the officals if they intend to continue giving me baseless irrelevant shady replies  ordering a power bank through swiggy not sure what to say\nits not a scam i think the powerbank is working fine if you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left it is fine\n20k mah powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure thats all\nlet me see if i can explain this\nsee what is the voltage of your powerbank these are normally 37 v so the total wattage is 37 v  20000 mah  37 v  20 ah  74 wh\n\nphones operate at 5 v so a single full charge of the phone need wattage  5 v  4500 mah  5 v  45 ah  225 wh\n\nso number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank  74  225  328 times considering 1015 wastage you will be able to charge it around 28 times so after 2 charges if it is having some more charge then i think that the powerbank is fine you are expecting too much from the powerbank you can buy another powerbank from amazon  flipkart but you will probably get similar results\nwhat were your expectations though\nits not a scam its working as expected i think you are misunderstanding how pb works as many comments have corrected your expectations"}]],"5":[[{"negative":0.9608877897,"neutral":0.0324371643,"positive":0.0066750464,"aspect":"instamart","text":"new

offering 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions hey fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso

working out to lose weight and improve my heart health my boyfriend joined the gym too with his own goals initially it was difficult for him to form the habit but he picked up quickly and was able to continue\n\nafter some days he was always late to the gym i used to pick him up on my way to the gym but he decided that i should not to do it because i made him hurry and i kept bickering about why he kept me waiting outside the door so he asked to stop picking him up because he wanted to workout in a positive  mindset i agreed\n\nlast thursday we had a nasty fight while going to the gym i had picked him up in that day though because he said he was okay with it the fight was about my our families i dont want to go into the details here but his family did something which very disrespectful towards mine i was angry while communicating this and i did make personal remarks about him to which he reacted that he would not workout that and left the gym i tried to stop by holding his hand but he pushed my hands away he left the building and i ran behind him calling out his name but he wont stop long story short we were able to solve the issue that day and come to agreement about what happened\n\nyesterday he had not woken up by the time i left for gym and said would workout in the afternoon he did not we agreed yesterday that he would be on time today but same thing today he did not wake up on time when i called he assured me that he would reach the gym but could not due some issues with his instamart order he was fighting g with customer care for refund i was very furious at this point that he did not take this part seriously the thing is he is always late to everywhere not 5 mins late more like 1 hour late late to gym late to dates and late to family events to the point where my mom had to wait for an hour for him and he still didi not come\n\nwhen i asked him over text he implied that he would not come and come later in the day i called him to confront and it became a very big fight besides all the slurs that we spit out these were the things that he said\n\n1 he will come to gym whenever he wants because that is what the subscription offers\n2 i am no one to decide when he should come\n3 he is adjusting his day by waking up early for gym it is his choice not to wake up so early\n\nsome extra context\n\n1 it was very difficult for me to start my fitness journey i needed a gym partner who i can rely on i am thankful to my boyfriend for having helped me in the beginning but he is pulling back\n\n2 i believe it is extremely important to be on time whatever the place may be unforeseen situations can be understood\n\n3 his place is like 2km away from gym whereas mine is 10km away\n\n4 initially we used to go in the afternoon but there would work calls for both us and we would eventually miss our sessions so we had agreed on doing the morning because there no work calls in the morning\n\n5 he has been to the gym by himself only once but has never completed a routine\n\nwhy i am writing this\n\n1 i want to understand if it alright feel this angry or do i have anger issues\n\n2 is my belief of punctuality a facade\n\n3 am i being too needy by depending on my boyfriend for support in this case\n\n4 should i just let go everytime he is late and say nothing is that the right thing to do 1 you dont have anger issues but may be the added pressure of maintaining the discipline towards losing weight is taking a toll on you  it totally understandable but doesnt excuse bad behaviour on your part as wellpersonal comments \n\n2 you have to ask it yourself if its a deal breaker for you  people are not punctual  its their prerogative dont take it personally but you have to decide if its a non negotiable for you \n\n3 yes you are lucky that your boyfriend supported you initially by going together  but he has a right to do it at his pace and not yours separate yourselves from gymming togther atleast for now \n\n4 no  dont let go  if he really cares for you  he should be on time atleast for important gatherings with family  thats disrespectful  imo \n\nalso  i think from whatver you have mentioned here in post  you guys are dealing with a lot more than just gym punctuality issues please have a honest communication with each other  make each other feel safe and these things can be concluded peacefully \nyou know hes not your child right you dont have to teach things like disciple to someone who doesnt want to\nyou cant force anyone to do what they dont want to \n\nyour anger is justified cz hes not punctual but why depend on someone and then get angry at them \n\nhe is a non punctual person  which isnt a good trait why date someone like him when youre very particular about timings date someone who matches your values \n\nsecondly how does he manage other times like office and meetings or anything important is he late there too  if he is he seriously lacks basic manners \n\nyou being dependent on someone for your own gym routine is wrong if u want to have a partner talk to someone in the gym only there may be people who come to gym regularly \n\nyour boyfriend isnt your child so stop mothering him by waking him up or reminding him to go to gym \n\nhes an adult and he wont do anything according to you so dont focus your energy on him he will drain you all and youll burn out \n\nlastly stop fighting and using slur against each other and running after him after a fight talk to each other like adults about your disagreements its very childish to runn after him after he barges out of the building \n\nhes irresponsible but you keep your calm and if u arent happy please leave\n\nyoure not wrong in expecting punctuality but he doesnt sound like the one for you\nbedroom innocent airport sugar soup soft fine flowery bike history\n\n this post was mass deleted and anonymized with redact\na gym is a personal matter and anyone can go whenever they want you cant force anyone neither to come with you to the gym nor to workout for their health youll just lose relationships by trying to force this and i say this as a regular gym goer with 2 years of weight loss journey of over 30 kgs now at first i used to try and make my friends boyfriend come with me thinking i discovered some big secret about how to look sexy and ill help them also to lose weight as well but then i realized i am just that irritating health freak for them who doesnt know to respect peoples boundaries and pot bellies \n\nso leave the gym aspect and do your own thing most people need to develop the willpower to do something in their mind first and then theyll do it themselves without your prodding"}]],"13":[[{"negative":0.3777896762,"neutral":0.2994037271,"positive":0.322806567,"aspect":"instamart","text":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25 week of july 29th 2024

years i decided it was time to add some new cards to my wallet ive used various cards in the past including hsbc hdfc and amex but i canceled most of them around 2019 keeping only one hdfc and citibank card for increased financial discipline my main card is the hdfc regalia gold as an imperia customer i purposely keep the credit limit limited and stay within it and avoid the temptation to upgrade\ud83d\ude42\u2194 the citi card moved to axis which i use as my beatup card in places where im not comfortable using the premium card keeping its limit below 1l so just these 2 cards and all the points go to regalia gold and use in smartbuy for all my guilt spends flights etc\n\nrecently noticed that i need an icici card sbi card as these are preferred by many ecomm sites for discounts\n\nmy details\n\n credit score\u00a0835 experian 844 crif as per cred\n current credit cards\u00a0hdfc regalia gold axis rupay upi enabled\n annual itr last 3 years\u00a0avg inr 80l\n\nsbi cashback card\u00a0got rejected\n\nbeing an sbi customer for over two decades with a platinum profile i saw a preapproved credit card offer on the online sbi site after logging in i completed the online application and kyc using digilocker data despite receiving an email from aadhar confirming successful kyc the sbi card site didnt respond the next day an sbi card agent called and someone came to my address for kyc after filling out a paper form and taking my picture the kyc was done however my application was later rejected being in the top 01 of the annual salary earners in this country and still getting rejected by sbiguess their criteria are as exclusive as a secret club now i understand the grin on ms dhonis face when he says  jaante hai inka bank kaun hai\ud83d\ude06\n\nhdfc swiggy card\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\ni applied for this card through hdfc net banking the online kyc process was smooth with no physical verification needed i received the hdfc swiggy cashback card in 34 days since we order a lot on swiggy instamart and zomato this card will replace my other cards for online transactions\n\nicici hpcl super saver\u00a0\u00a0approved\n\nwith no prior relationship with icici i applied for this card directly on their site i chose this card because i spend around 67k monthly on hpcl fuel icici cards also offer more discounts on various platforms compared to hdfc the application process was smooth with an option for video kyc despite some initial issues with browser compatibility the kyc was completed successfully using google chrome the application was approved the next day and i received the card in 3 days i promptly disabled chrome afterward\n\nlearnings\n\n1 digital efficiency hdfc stands out for its smooth fully online process setting a benchmark for digital efficiency\n2 customer experience icicis process was also efficient though slightly marred by browser compatibility issues their wide range of discounts adds significant value to their cards\n3 service gaps sbi needs to bridge the gap between their digital promises and actual service delivery to enhance customer satisfaction\n\nin conclusion while each provider has its strengths and weaknesses the overall experience has been enlightening its clear that a strong digital infrastructure and customercentric approach are key to a seamless credit card application process just one question with an 80l  annual income  why are you applying for cards like swiggy hdfc instead of just upgrading your regalia gold to infinia \nim more interested to know what you do for a living\ncrif  exeperian are secondary primarily only cibil is checked by the banks\nit seems like you ownrun a business banks prefer salaried employees in comparison with business people even if business people file for higher itr \n\n  \nanyways what the your 3 major spend category or maybe tell us platform \n\n  \nbut in general i will recommend you hsbc live 10 on zomato dining in and dmart 15 all other but ignore if you only use swiggy since you already have hdfc swiggy amazon icic or axis fk depending on the platform you shop from kotak myntra if you shop from myntra axis airtel if you have airtel broadband or sim \n\n  \nso with the card you already have and if you add any of the above mentioned cards you have covered lounge access amazon or fk shoppping food deliverydine in utility payments myntra shopping 5 on most online spents using swiggy card upi card groceries shopping at dmart and miscellaneous offline payments\n1 an 80l earner preferring minor cashback over major rewards seems counterintuitive  \n2 to experience a better version of sbi apply for their aurum comes with great lifestyle benefits  \n3 your icici card is a cobranded one these often dont get the respective discounts that the core cards get"}]],"31":[[{"negative":0.1480950564,"neutral":0.2297998071,"positive":0.6221051812,"aspect":"instamart","text":"ecommerce industry news recap \ud83d\udd25

this\n\n if youre willing enough then go to consumer court that or a social media outrage\ni have encountered similar situations had to reach out to customer service several times to ensure i received the refund amount i relentlessly contacted them until i got my refund\norder milk instead and get hersheys \ud83d\ude09\ni usually get refunds btw i am almost a regular customer\nif you used a credit

to return things once im gone he simply told me to wait till 8 am as id have a resolution by then i waited and still hadnt recieved an email i messaged these guys again now they told me they had a technical issue so id have to wait again i wouldnt have been told about said technical issue if i hadnt contacted them the guy had said to me id have a resolution by 8 am but i didnt i was simply lied to i waited another 6 hours again at 2 am im again told they had a technical issue and now ill have to wait 24 hours again i wont even be here in the next 2 hours my experience has been so horrible

been running around for a refund for the past 13 hours while swiggy lies about giving resolution within the next 6 hours and later uses technical issues again and again as an excuse to make me wait longer and longer so i give up on the refund  file a case\n\n\nits not about the money\n\n\nfile a case\nedit got a refund after i ended up bashing out at the service agent unfortunately\ni think one of the issues is a lack of trust i know a guy in my office who regularly orders stuff and food online and talks to customer care then gets a refund \nunfortunately they have to be more stringent about it im also certainly not defending the fact that these guys gave you a specific and didnt hold up to it its annoying when these ecommerce websites do this\neven i faced similar issues with refund they

farmer but since my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit promotion council of keralavfpck which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable  vegetable wholesalers \u0d28 \u0d38\u0d2e\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d1a \u0d28\u0d15\u0d15\u0d2f

this is how the supply chain usually works farmer  wholesaler   retailer big retailers usually bypass the wholesaler but small retailers need the wholesaler because they cant buy in bulk hotels and small tea shops buy from the wholesaler as well \n\nthe wholesaler looks for just one thing your consistency in supply for them its a numbers game more than the price they focus on moving the goods at a fast pace since their margins are low if i remember correctly a kg of banana earns them a profit of around 45 rupees my local wholesaler moves around 3 tons of banana in a day \n\nyou need to build rapport with them and they will give you a higher price for quality produce"}]],"47":[[{"negative":0.7221744061,"neutral":0.2698183656,"positive":0.0080072694,"aspect":"instamart","text":"hdfc swiggy
