have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","1":"ordered for more than rs1000 on blinkit and they asked me to add one free diwali goodie to my cart from a list which had boxes of kaju katli and ferrero rocher chose the pack of 04 rochers the delivery boy arrived at my doorstep loudly announcing that someone had eaten one of the chocs and it wasnt him now since this was a free gift customer care just apologized and wished me a happy diwali\n\nitem missing is one thing but how does one determine nothing else is tampered with in an open pack this will end up in the bin most probably paid the price for not going desi kaju katli\n\nedit somehow the picture didnt get into the post added now\n\n\n\n","4":"hey fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money","5":"how do i make money asap

day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for

well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui

pathway to all its other profitable business except bigb\u00a0\n\n but through internal team messages and emails its clear that tata has no proper plans to make it survive \u00a0\n\n i know so many

give me an expired one so i tried to return it but i missed the delivery guy call in which they made my order not returnable then i again order something and i told the delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it i am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend

Paid the price for not going Desi (Kaju Katli).\n\nEdit: Somehow the picture didn't get into the post, added now.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/brxaeyhqifxd1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=258c0cc5177732aa5c891654c90af658ba61fb85\n\n","4":"Is HSBC Live+ not offering 10% Cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions? Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","5":"How to prepare for the worst economic outcome?

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","7":"Confused About ON Whey Protein Authenticity I recently ordered **Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein** from Blinkit and I\u2019m confused about its authenticity.  \nSupplier is Moonstone Ventures LLP as per invoice on Blinkit, which is the authorised online seller for ON\n\nHere\u2019s the situation:\n\n* The product came with a QR **verification sticker** that directed me to [**authenticateyouron.com**](http:\/\/authenticateyouron.com\/) instead of the official ON site ([authenticateon.in](http:\/\/authenticateon.in)).\n* When I scratched the code, the fake-looking site verified the product as authentic.\n\nWhen I raised this issue with Blinkit\u2019s customer care, one agent admitted it could be counterfeit and escalated it.

In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

As of today i use upi in most transactions so if i start using cc more it may even go upto 8-10 annually. I wanted infinia but bank says i am only eligible for diners black metal. I asked amex customer care and they said i am also eligible for amex platinum (both normal and reserve). Which cc should i get considering my spends and the fact that i take domestic flights quite frequently (though so not use hotels) and want lounge access atleast apart from good reward points. Also suggest from a pov where i may have huge wedding expenses next year.","10":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, \u201cWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use \u2013 things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.\u201d\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0offering\u00a0an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 \u2014 excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items. (What's considered a \u2018luxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, \u201cHold my beer\u2026\u201d\n___\n**WhatsApp**\u00a0is\u00a0getting a new chat memory feature\u00a0that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service. Sellers do not need to sign up to be eligible to receive the label, which does not have a cost. Alongside the change, eBay Germany is dropping its \u201ceBay Guarantee\u201d and \u201ceBay Plus\u201d logos.\n___\n**Bestbuy Baby**, which has nothing to do with Best Buy the electronics retailer and is actually a baby retailer that had been part of the Bed Bath & Beyond group, is\u00a0closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores\u00a0to relaunch as a strictly online platform. The retailer previously closed and liquidated 115 locations last year when its parent company went bankrupt, but then months later announced a new strategy and the opening of 11 new stores, which will soon be shuttered.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing the sale\u00a0of refurbished electronics from select sellers on its platform, all which are required to meet specific performance standards. For example, sellers must provide reports from an approved 3rd party like PhoneCheck, Blancco, or BlackBelt, who inspect and rate the quality of the refurbished products. Currently only \u201cpremium\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d items can be sold.\n___\nPlus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Klarna** selling most of its portfolio of short-term, interest-free loans to Elliott Advisors, a London-based hedge fund, for \u00a330B.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","11":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/ - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, \u201cWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use \u2013 things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.\u201d\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0offering\u00a0an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 \u2014 excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items.

I was looking forward to throwing away my useless towel from blinkit that keeps attaching little fibres on my body everytime I fucking use it. I ordered new, good towels, with great expectation, so that I don't have to deal with that sensory nightmare.\n\nI waited till 12pm. Checked. Still not out for delivery.\nI waited till 4pm. Checked. Nuh uh still no luck.\nI was getting impatient and tired of fucking waiting. Whatever maybe it's just coming tomorrow, I thought.\n\n7pm I resorted to taking a shower and using my towel, the worst towel in the entire universe. Got dressed, towel fibers attached to my fucking body, I'm lotioning myself and I can feel those fibres, I felt so irritated, I waited so long, why aren't my fucking towels here yet? Whatever, I'll be eating dinner outside with my friend and I'll be happy.\n\nIt's 7:30pm now, already ate 4 sushi and downed 1 bottle of soju, having a good conversation with my friend that I haven't seen in years. And that's your cue. \n\nThat's your fucking timing to deliver my fucking towels. While I'm out to a place with low cell service, that's when you had to show up to my building, when there's literally no way I can receive my goddamn towels. Aren't you amazing?

Yesterday one of the delivery partner was robbed by the customer who ordered the product. He came in a car, he was with two women, all three seems to be drunk. He took the product, beat up the delivery guy, abused him and took his phone as well and ran off. The delivery partner had two phones, both the phones were robbed by the customer. \n\nThe delivery guy would be in his 30s and has a small family. \nThis delivery guy came running in the morning to tell the ordeal to the Manager, the case Sint being looked into without any seriousness. He was told to come after half an hour by the manager and told actions will be taken. So far no actions has been taken by blinkit and this guy has been running around the whole day saying saar help kar dijiye help kar dijiye.","21":"Beware of LazyPay Scam! \u203c\ufe0f I just wanted to give a heads up about Lazypay scam that\u2019s been happening recently. Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nWhile I was at work, I received a call from an international number. I thought it was a friend, but the voice clarity was poor, so I disconnected the call. Within minutes, three transactions were made through Blinkit, using LazyPay as the payment option.\n\nI realized something was wrong and contacted LazyPay customer service. They told me that an agent would call me back, but I haven\u2019t received any response yet. I logged into the Blinkit app, but there were no orders showing under my account.\n\nI approached Blinkit customer service again, and they advised me to contact cybercrime. I reported the incident to the cybercrime helpline (1930), and they took my complaint, initiated the process, and gave me an acknowledgment number. They also asked me to go to the Madhapur police station, which I did, but so far, I haven\u2019t received any further updates.\n\nI know I may not get the money back, but at the very least, I want to know how this scam worked. I'm sharing this so others can be aware and avoid the same situation.","22":"Blinkit is getting worst day by day.  I have ordered some groceries few days back from Blinkit and it got delivered in this bag. I had a word with deliver guy and he told me that Blinkit is not giving him a delivery bag since last 1 year. Asked the reason why it wasn't packed in a paper bag. He said store doesn't have paper bags since two days. Delivery guy requested to raise the concern to Blinkit so that he can atleast get a delivery bag. \n\nAfter few hours, I spoke to their representative and informed them regarding the same and asked them to provide the delivery bag to the poor delivery guy coz the bag he was using is not hygenic. I have also requested them to arrange the return of the items if possible coz It had veggies, milk etc. and i don't feel like using it as it wasn't delivered in a hygenic bag. To my surprise, the customer service representative refused to arrange the return stating that they don't have any option of return in such cases. I wasn't happy but I don't wanna feel like wasting my time arguing for the same. But I just don't feel like using Blinkit again after having such a bad experience. \n\n","23":"Blinkit's Shady Refund Tactics I'm disappointed with Blinkit's recent customer service experience. After they canceled my order, they refunded the amount as a 30-day promo code. This is unacceptable, especially considering it was their mistake.\n\nThe SMS wording implies it's a free gift, not a refund. While the amount may seem small, it's the principle that matters. What if it were a larger sum? Would they still issue the refund as a promo & impose a time limit?\n\nCustomer service has been unresponsive and refuses to rectify the issue.  \n  \nFrom the comments, it's obvious that Blinkit is doing this for bigger order amounts (1k+) too.\n\n**I've taken to Twitter to voice my concern.

Recently, the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company Zomato announced an initiative, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, to limit food wastage because of canceled orders.\n\nRight after Zomato\u2019s cofounder Deepinder Goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media, a Bengaluru-based product manager, suggested potential improvements on Twitter for the feature to prevent misuse.\n\nThe man named Bhanu proposed that Zomato\u2019s Food Rescue option should exclude cash-on-delivery orders, and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500-metre radius of their location.\n\nHe opined that customers can misuse the discounts, where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices. Further, the Bengaluru man recommended that Zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer, capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature.\n\nThoroughly impressed, the Zomato boss responded directly to Bhanu\u2019s post, saying that these suggestions, among others, had already been incorporated into the feature. Goyal praised Bhanu\u2019s \u201cgood thinking,\u201d and inquired about Bhanu\u2019s background expressing the desire to work together in the future.\n\n\u201cWho are you and what do you do?\u201d the Zomato cofounder wrote. \u201cWould love to know you more, and see if we can work together.\u201d\n\nBhanu replied that he is a product manager based in Bengaluru, working for a startup. He also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media, particularly tagging Zomato\u2019s sister company, Blinkit. \n\nIncidentally, with Zomato\u2019s new feature, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order. To maintain the quality and freshness of the food, the option will remain open only for a short time. ","31":"What is wrong with blinkit?  So I ordered 3 milk packets and all curdled.

(This data based on internal rumors, Take it with a bag of salt)\u00a0\n\nWhat is wrong with Tata Neu?\u00a0\n\n* Tata Neu lost 65-75 % of its users just few months after its launch. Tata is also losing Neu costumers who aren\u2019t active on the Neu app, whereas its other businesses are doing well individually. \u00a0\n\n* More than 25 to 30% users let their Neu coins expire without claiming them, as most users don\u2019t visit the app frequently.\u00a0\n\n* Most Tata Neu card users are using their credit card for UPI spends and redeeming it for low value items.\u00a0\n\n* Also, Tata Neu card users use the Tata Neu Rupay card with other UPI apps. (Tata has made it mandatory to use Tata neu app to gain 1.5% UPI cashbacks from Aug 1,2024)\u00a0\n\n* The super app doesn\u2019t have UI consistency, the Tata digital team just used their internal Dev team and rushed the app to launch for Tata IPL 2022, most UI bugs are still under progress.\u00a0\n\n* There have been very little investments made towards customer support (Call center) and they have been repurposing internal Tata Digital staff.\u00a0\n\nWhy won\u2019t Tata Neu survive?\u00a0\n\n* Tata neu marketing team is basically dead, their Instagram and Twitter (X) posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement.\u00a0\n\n* Blinkit beats Bigbasket by a mile, Tata 1mg users just stick to that app, ONDC orders are negligible, and people just use Zomato\/Swiggy. \u00a0\n\n* Premium users of Tata Cliq, Vistara and IHCL (Taj) don\u2019t give a shit about the buggy app.\u00a0\n\n* Amazon is still preferred over Chroma (Online delivery) and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app.\u00a0\n\nWill Tata Neu shut down?\u00a0\n\n* Basically Tata, Jio and Adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning. \u00a0\n\n* Now comes the spicy part, Tata has a reputation problem, and it may not shut it down as it's a pathway to all its other profitable business (except BigB).\u00a0\n\n* But through internal team messages and emails it's clear that Tata has no proper plans to make it survive. \u00a0\n\n I know so many users in this community have Tata Neu card, what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down?\n\n\u00a0","38":"Never buy books from blinkit and instamart Never buy books from apps like Blinkit or Instamart.

In the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it. So after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders. My friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them. So after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there. It was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language. They even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me. After we talked to manager. The manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry. The another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it. I said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue. then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian. So they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them.\n\nThen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry. Then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen. They asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless. They asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money. Somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused. Then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it. I am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead.

have delivery partners for night shifts yesterday one of the delivery partner was robbed by the customer who ordered the product he came in a car he was with two women all three seems to be drunk he took the product beat up the delivery guy abused him and took his phone as well and ran off the delivery partner had two phones both the phones were robbed by the customer \n\nthe delivery guy would be in his 30s and has a small family \nthis delivery guy came running in the morning to tell the ordeal to the manager the case sint being looked into without any seriousness he was told to come after half an hour by the manager and told actions will be taken so far no actions has been taken by blinkit and this guy has been running around the whole day saying saar help kar dijiye help kar dijiye if you have the address of the customer or the phone number or even the location where this happened then why dont file fir first like i dont think a manager would like to get involved in thistime is crucial go to police first\n post this on linkedin\nlawyer here go to area police atation and lodge a writen complaintask them to trace the customer basis details given by the delivery partner and get the phones back the phones will have location details iewhere these were last tracked this will give the police and you concrete proof then use this detail to lodge a formal fir for theft and wrongful hurt if need be if police does not want to convert it into fir and  customer is willing to pay compensationi suggest this will be the way to go fir and subsequent court proceedings giving evidence etc can be painful for any personthats why i am suggesting this and used the wordsif need be\nbe sure to post on linkedin \nall of us here will help to get reach\ncall police asap and get medical done","21":"beware of lazypay scam \u203c i just wanted to give a heads up about lazypay scam thats been happening recently heres what happened\n\nwhile i was at work i received a call from an international number i thought it was a friend but the voice clarity was poor so i disconnected the call within minutes three transactions were made through blinkit using lazypay as the payment option\n\ni realized something was wrong and contacted lazypay customer service they told me that an agent would call me back but i havent received any response yet i logged into the blinkit app but there were no orders showing under my account\n\ni approached blinkit customer service again and they advised me to contact cybercrime i reported the incident to the cybercrime helpline 1930 and they took my complaint initiated the process and gave me an acknowledgment number they also asked me to go to the madhapur police station which i did but so far i havent received any further updates\n\ni know i may not get the money back but at the very least i want to know how this scam worked im sharing this so others can be aware and avoid the same situation i dont know about the lazypy scam but the cybercrime police are a joke unless you have a vast network\n\nthey dont even do anything they keep cases open for days and then close them and thats it \nfrom that point forward nothing will happen\ndid you have lazypay account  what was the duration of the call you received \ndont pay lazypay the amount if it is use now pay later and ask for the clarification\nhow big was the amount\nnot only lazypay this has happened in mobikwik as well which is enabled with paylater option they ask for confirmation to enter 1 for yes and then otp for confirmation irrespective of the option you choose otp is asked and theyll call you multiple times until they get the otp from you \n\nthey link it with online apps like blinkit zepto etc and the orders will be placed automatically if you check online with mobikwik scam many linkedin posts will be shown where they lost upto 50k to 1 lakh and they paid that amount to not loose their credit score\n\nbeware when you get these kind of calls","22":"blinkit is getting worst day by day  i have ordered some groceries few days back from blinkit and it got delivered in this bag i had a word with deliver guy and he told me that blinkit is

blinkit so that he can atleast get a delivery bag \n\nafter few hours i spoke to their representative and informed them regarding the same and asked them to provide the delivery bag to the poor delivery guy coz the bag he was using is not hygenic i have also requested them to arrange the return of the items if possible coz it had veggies milk etc and i dont feel like using it as it wasnt delivered in a hygenic bag to my surprise the customer service representative refused to arrange the return stating that they dont have any option of return in such cases i wasnt happy but i dont wanna feel like wasting my time arguing for the same but i just dont feel like using blinkit again after having such a bad experience \n\n looks like they have used up all the capital they

the amount as a 30day promo code this is unacceptable especially considering it was their mistake\n\nthe sms wording implies its a free gift not a refund while the amount may seem small its the principle that matters what if it were a larger sum would they still issue the refund as a promo  impose a time limit\n\ncustomer service has been unresponsive and refuses to rectify the issue  \n  \nfrom the comments its obvious that blinkit is doing this for bigger order amounts 1k too\n\nive taken to twitter to voice my concern please show your support by liking and retweeting my post\n\n i got a refund in my bank account when you speak to customer care you have option to chose whether you want a refund or a coupon did you not have it\ni find them shady too  lots of expired products and return refund process isnt quick\nrecently ola cabs was instructed by a government body to give refund options to customers through original mode of payment if someone can file against blinkit that would be great\ni had the same experience on swiggy instamart for a missing item moreover they placed restrictions on the item i could order like no diary product etc\nhey op did you get a favorable from blinkit regarding this\ni am also in a similar boat no option to receive money back to my original mode of payment\nreceived refund as 30day promo code which lapsed\ni have had multiple chats

limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their mamma got \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udca2\nthose were such basic observations\nif zomato didnt even think about those before implementing the feature god save them","31":"what is wrong with blinkit  so i ordered 3 milk packets and all curdled i message blinkit and the customer service dude is calling me at 10 pm asking for pics of each and

neu pr ream this data based on internal rumors take it with a bag of salt\u00a0\n\nwhat is wrong with tata neu\u00a0\n\n tata neu lost 6575  of its users just few months after its launch tata is also losing neu costumers who arent active on the neu app whereas its other businesses are doing well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui bugs are still under progress\u00a0\n\n there have been very little investments made towards customer support call center and they have been repurposing internal tata digital staff\u00a0\n\nwhy wont tata neu survive\u00a0\n\n tata neu marketing team is basically dead their instagram and twitter x posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement\u00a0\n\n blinkit beats bigbasket by a mile tata 1mg users just stick to that app ondc orders are negligible and people just use zomatoswiggy \u00a0\n\n premium users of tata cliq vistara and ihcl taj dont give a shit about the buggy app\u00a0\n\n amazon is still preferred over chroma online delivery and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app\u00a0\n\nwill tata neu shut down\u00a0\n\n basically tata jio and adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning \u00a0\n\n now comes the spicy part tata has a reputation problem and it may not shut it down as its a pathway to all its other profitable business except bigb\u00a0\n\n but through internal team messages and emails its clear that tata has no proper plans to make it survive \u00a0\n\n i know so many users in this community have tata neu card what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down\n\n\u00a0 tata neu tries to be everything but nothing is native in app it feels like a browser wrapper with link to individual platforms since its developed by tcs no hate to devs im sure they dont have a ui ux or ab testing team\ndeleted\nnot surprised the uiux of app is total shit \n\npricing of products are mostly higher than amazonflipkartzomatoswiggy which makes neucoins value lesser than 5 \n\ni have this card and i only use it for paying bills only to get 5 neu coins but i could never find any product on neu which is priced similar to fkamazon to spend those coins\nthey should learn something from swiggy zomato etc  where uiux is so much better\u00a0\n\ntata is way behind in its all apps it is like they are still stuck in 2010  the experience is same\n\nbut still use the tata neu app for bigbasket orders for that sweet cashback\n\u00a0\ni am early adopter and had redeemed 24k neucoins since launch\ntata neu coins expiry date always get extended after every coins addition to the cumulative balance \n\ncollected 4k worth of coins\n\n\ncroma also comes with good offer people are just not aware of it\n\neven nothing   cmf phones are sold through croma at same

has been a buzz about the hdfc pixel play card recently i had applied for this card and i got it approved ltf for the 5 categories i had selected grocery and fashion categories the grocery category includes blinkit after i got the card activated i used it on blinkit hoping ill get 5 cashback but instead i only got 1 cashpoints credited to my account i raised a ticket for the same the customer support says theyll investigate this matter and resolve this issue they have given a resolution date of 23rd december \nwhat should i do now you should wait till 23rd december\npixel is a product by amateurs in their spare time from the garage hdfc bank dissociates themselves with the payzapp team so avoid strongly at the moment having lots of bugs and issues tracking cashback even errors during card application \nwas the matter addressed by the customer support\ni also got the card today \nhow does the 3 payzapp cashback work on what kind of payments kindly explain","43":"zomato delivery guy took my 2k money  idk how to start this but i orderd a package from blinkit which they give me an expired one so i tried to return it but i missed the delivery guy call in which they made my order not returnable then i again order something and i told the delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it i am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead they even hit us and tried to fight with us i just wanted to share this bc the thing havent gone this far if the zomato had improved there customer support you did kinda wrong by placing multiple orders and refusing it \n\nim not saying they were right what they did also was not correct \n\nbut you could have emailed to customer care and if they still wouldnt help you you could always put in a complaint in the consumer forum you might have gotten a compensation as well"},"cleantext":{"0":["toxic","work","culture","ft","working","year","toxic","work","culture","lot","publicity","bad","thing","aadit","start","work","2pm","wake","early","meeting","setup","2am","morning","start","work","12pm","hr","trying","free","breakfast","start","work","finish","work","11pm","night","meeting","delayed","meeting","happen","time","getting","postponed","including","townhalls","lot","youngster","hired","senior","work","culture","work","14","hour","lot","dark","pattern","app","extract","money","customer","multiple","way","including","charging","customer","phone","30000","inr","customer","data","profiled","security","really","bad","despite","multiple","leak","fixing","important","growth","investor","pressure","marketing","person","hr","head","clear","culture","important","org","cost","cutting","layoff","going","start","march","tech","team","work","1am","seen","tablet","stay","awake","lot","young","care","health","junior","hired","salary","cut","march","massive","round","layoff","hiring","stopped","department","product","design","try","desperately","copy","checking","match","lot","fake","data","given","medium","employee","encouraged","posting","material","linkedin","social","medium","copy","image","given","employee","pr","massive","case","fraud","disclose","without","revealing","position","leave","company","week","20","young","hired","yearly","performance","appraisal","going","cancelled","going","awarded","minor","hike","staying","ipo","2","year","money","bold","u","bro","shit","viral","friend","left","ago","vouch","additionally","workplace","cesspool","politics","team","try","credit","work","massive","funding","leading","massive","hiring","cultural","fit","present","team","massive","hiring","room","grow","promotion","upper","role","hired","employee","churn","ratio","abysmal","lot","dark","pattern","app","extract","money","customer","multiple","way","including","charging","customer","phone","30000","inr","outright","illegal","consumer","protection","act","2019","information","technology","act","2000","byjus","making","openly","talked","recently","dodged","bullet","interview","scheduled","senior","position","pretty","senior","position","core","department","person","supposed","interview","show","thrice","different","time","noshow","told","hr","business","guess","thanking","edit","going","viral","feel","posting","screenshots","follow","message","sent","non","conclusive","response","hr","non","attended","call"],"1":["blinkits","diwali","gift","ordered","rs1000","asked","add","free","diwali","goodie","cart","list","box","kaju","katli","ferrero","rocher","chose","pack","04","rochers","boy","arrived","doorstep","loudly","announcing","eaten","choc","wasnt","free","gift","customer","care","apologized","wished","happy","diwali","item","missing","determine","tampered","open","pack","end","bin","probably","paid","price","going","desi","kaju","katli","edit","picture","added","spent","r","1000","couldnt","deliver","free","gift","properly","apse","1000","r","kharch","karwana","chahta","chocolate","pack","sealed","health","concern","opened","seal","changed","chocolate","poisonous","consume","request","replacement","shouldnt","accepted","customer","care","boy","reached","door","asked","confess","support","time","state","away","deny","weird","story","share","receive","chocolate","frozen","item","ordered","complained","assured","redelivery","soon","hung","customer","care","executive","item","delivered","woah","quick","within","minute","received","item","including","chocolate","contacted","customer","care","attributed","misunderstanding","end","telling","set","item","guess","free","item","food","item","food","spoiled","rotten","mold","infested","stuff","expired","lucky","wont","risk","eating","ordered","box","really"],"4":["hsbc","live","offering","cashback","flipkart","grocery","transaction","hey","fellow","credit","card","enthusiast","recently","picked","hsbc","live","credit","card","come","highest","fee","paid","far999","gst","significant","portion","spending","go","grocery","especially","item","milk","fruit","veggie","usually","shop","flipkart","bigbasket","tataneu","jiomart","amazon","fresh","occasional","ill","dmart","ready","there","great","discount","using","following","card","earlier","flipkart","axis","ltf","5","flipkart","grocery","bb","gift","card","bought","1025","discount","bb","tataneu","smaller","transaction","tataneu","infinityltf","instant","discount","neucoins","axis","acechargeable","jiomart","15","cashback","hdfc","millennialtf","amazon","icici","ltf","amazon","fresh","hdfc","swiggyltf","cashback","axis","ace","chargeable","15","dmart","ready","making","transaction","reached","hsbc","customer","care","confirm","cashback","eligibility","informed","jiomart","purchase","qualify","cashback","great","flipkart","transaction","earning","regular","15","reward","rate","despite","spending","specifically","flipkart","grocery","doublechecked","merchant","flipkart","axis","axis","ace","statementit","cl

work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there

credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart

for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for

manager from a tweet   recently the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company zomato announced an initiative food rescue to limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their mamma got \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udca2\nthose were such basic observations\nif zomato didnt even think about those before implementing the feature god save

not associated with tata group and i dont give a shit about tata neu pr ream this data based on internal rumors take it with a bag of salt\u00a0\n\nwhat is wrong with tata neu\u00a0\n\n tata neu lost 6575  of its users just few months after its launch tata is also losing neu costumers who arent active on the neu app whereas its other businesses are doing well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui bugs are still under progress\u00a0\n\n there have been very little investments made towards customer support call center and they have been repurposing internal tata digital staff\u00a0\n\nwhy wont tata neu survive\u00a0\n\n tata neu marketing team is basically dead their instagram and twitter x posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement\u00a0\n\n blinkit beats bigbasket by a mile tata 1mg users just stick to that app ondc orders are negligible and people just use zomatoswiggy \u00a0\n\n premium users of tata cliq vistara and ihcl taj dont give a shit about the buggy app\u00a0\n\n amazon is still preferred over chroma online delivery and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app\u00a0\n\nwill tata neu shut down\u00a0\n\n basically tata jio and adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning \u00a0\n\n now comes the spicy part tata has a reputation problem and it may not shut it down as its a pathway to all its other profitable business except bigb\u00a0\n\n but through internal team messages and emails its clear that tata has no proper plans to make it survive \u00a0\n\n i know so many users in this community have tata neu card what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down\n\n\u00a0 tata neu tries to be everything but nothing is native in app it feels like a browser wrapper with link to individual platforms since its developed by tcs no hate to devs im sure they dont have a ui ux or ab testing team\ndeleted\nnot surprised the uiux of app is total shit \n\npricing of products are mostly higher than amazonflipkartzomatoswiggy which makes neucoins value lesser than 5 \n\ni have this card and i only use it for paying bills only to get 5 neu coins but i could never find any product on neu which is priced similar to fkamazon to spend those coins\nthey should learn something from swiggy zomato etc  where uiux is so much better\u00a0\n\ntata is way behind in its all apps it is like they are still stuck in 2010  the experience is same\n\nbut still use the tata neu app for bigbasket orders for that sweet cashback\n\u00a0\ni am early adopter and had redeemed 24k neucoins since launch\ntata neu coins expiry date always get extended after every coins addition to the cumulative balance \n\ncollected 4k worth of coins\n\n\ncroma also comes with good offer people are just not aware of it\n\neven

delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the
