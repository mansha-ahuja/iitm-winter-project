have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","1":"bold","2":"\n\nhey everyone\n\ni wanted to share a disturbing experience i had with zepto recently and i feel its important for others to be aware\n\ni ordered two packs of cigarettes which should have cost 680 as per the mrp but when i got the bill the total came to 69728 for the items alone they charged an extra 1728 over the mrp which is gst on delivery charges totally fake shizz\n\non top of that even though im a zepto pass member which is supposed to give me free delivery on orders above 199 they still charged me a delivery fee of 27 and heres the kickerthe gst on this delivery fee was 1728 how does that make sense gst on 27 shouldnt be that high\n\ni feel completely cheated its not just about a few extra rupees its about trust and honesty if a company is willing to overcharge and sneak in extra fees what else are they doing behind the scenes\n\ni reached out to customer service but they werent helpful this isnt the kind of service i expected especially from a company that prides itself on convenience and customer satisfaction\n\nim sharing this to warn others\n\ncheck your bills carefully dont assume the charges are correct\n\nspeak up if something seems off companies need to know we wont tolerate being overcharged\n\n\nhas anyone else experienced this with zepto or other delivery apps lets hold them

i experienced a fraud from zepto where delivery guy will say order is delivered even without actually delivering the order  and worst part is customer care will not take any action and you will end up losing the money \nwhen i had reported the issue to the customer care person she said the delivery guy has delivered the order and received the cash from me  which is very weird because the order was a prepaid order and after telling multiple times times the delivery person is lying zepto didnt do anything  they show like its your fault and you end up losing your money\n\nzepto is the worst \nplease beware ","8":"recently saw a guys encounter with a zepto guy who broke down and thought of sharing a similar incident that took place some 45 months ago \n\ni had portered some stuff not heavy duty from a friend who lived on the other side of the city even when i contacted him first he seemed flustered and spoke something about the previous customer scamming him he didnt seem to want to talk so i let it be when he arrived an hour later i recieved the order and made the payment paid 100 rs extra because i saw him on maps fiddling around a lot in confusing lanes \n\nhe saw the amount and thanked me he was preparing to leave when i asked about what happened with the previous customer he sounded very low and explained how he had foolishly lost 2000 rupees through an online transaction dont remember the specifics of the scam but he was an older guy so it would be easy to fool him with virtual stuff \n\nthere were slight tears in his eyes i could see it clearly through his helm i asked him if he was okay \n\nthats when he broke down said that 2000 rupees is like a weeks worth of profit for him he said kya kar sakte hai bhai and again prepared to leave\n\ni always feel bad for grownups who still havent got their big break and it shattered my heart somewhat i asked him for his scanner he insisted that he didnt need anything and that hell get it back with gods blessing but after my request he finally relented \n\ni gave him back his 2000 rupees and he broke down again he kept folding his hands and asking for my number i think he didnt know he could send me back the money by tracing his previous transactions \n\ni kept descalating the situation by telling him that its his money and he didnt need to return anything the way he cried was sincere and struck me deeply\n\ni learner the hard way that delhi is not for the bighearted and choose very carefully whom to help but this dude sounded genuine\n\nwhat do you guys think even if the story was fake and

portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso

for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a booktok creator can organize a book club meeting a foodtok creator can host a cooking class or a newmusic creator can book tickets to a local concert\n\ntiktok also partnered with distrokid a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app artists using distrokid

us when it was introduced in 2018 but now block says that its revising its approach to focus on growing within the us instead of continuing to expand into new markets its strange though to call the uk a new market given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago while only having launched in the us in 2013 cash app has been part of uk for more than half its existence i wouldnt necessarily call that new\n\na new class action lawsuit against temu alleges that the company violates the united states donotcall registry status when sharing promotions phyllis king a delaware resident filed

been more than an hour and its not even raining\n\nand to top all that theres no way to contact the customer support in the app no way to talk to any agent theres no option to even chat\n\ni am so pissed right now i dont know what to do","26":"placed an order with dunzo  took more than 2 hours to deliver stating theres no delivery partner  unable to cancel cause the app said the order is processed  tried to communicate with them but its a one way communication with a bot which they did not even reply later  \nalso i realised after that i could get the same order in zepto for a way lesser price which i later did and they were at least very responsive over the chat although there was a slight delay which i completely understand cause of the delay \n\npoint is  their customer service sucks and they should atleast give us an option to cancel the order is they cannot deliver it within the promised time ","29":"\nyesterday i had the honor of discovering zeptos unique interpretation of time you see they promised me a 5minute deliverya magical feat that could make even amazon prime blush i placed my order imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials reality a solid 1520 varna minutes later for the uninitiated varna time works like dog yearsmultiply by three my order finally arrived\n\nthinking this was a oneoff glitch i reached out to zeptos customer service big mistake heres how that went\n\t1\tcustomer service attempt 1 were trying to contact the rider\ntranslation weve lost the rider please send thoughts and prayers\n\t2\tcustomer service attempt 2 the rider went to the wrong location\ntranslation our gps works about as well as our delivery times\n\t3\tcustomer service attempt 3 crickets\ntranslation weve decided to ghost you\n\nto add insult to injury the apps order history mysteriously stopped loadingeverything else worked fine but not the one feature i needed coincidence i think not\n\ndetermined to validate my experience i ran a little experiment today same order same 5minute promise result a 35minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport meanwhile blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutesand actually deliver within that timeframe shocking i know\n\nso dear zepto is this your new business strategy lure us in with false promises frustrate us with disappearing riders and then leave us questioning our life choices if so its working brilliantly\n\nscreenshots enclosed because sometimes you just need receipts to cope they are very clever to ensure that the phones time is not visible when you are on the app but i can assure you both the screenshots are 15 minutes apart","30":"hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past 2 years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\n\nstat of the week china couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023 this volume equates to 7143 packages per person 5144 parcels per second and 440 million packages per day  according to the state post bureau\n\nklarna is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called klarna balance the company also introduced a cashback rewards program where customers can earn up to 10 cash back when using the klarna app to shop at participating retailers in europe klarna already has a banking license has offered similar services in germany since 2021 and is now expanding itll offer customers interest rates as high as 358 for savings in the us klarna doesnt have a banking license and is operating through partner banks its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the us as the money held isnt protected by the fdic there is also no interest offered to us customers\n\ntiktok users in the us who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to 300 in discounts or a 100 amazon gift card for every new creator they refer users are rewarded after an eligible creator youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k followers accepts and joins tiktoks 1 min growth program using the invitation code andrew hutchinson of social media today wrote that the incentive seems a little desperate and a little like tiktok is running out of ideas for growth given that its resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across personally i dont think that the move screams desperation im a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships however i question whether this particular promotion will be effective does tiktok think that youtubers with 10k subscribers and instagrammers with 100k

provider operating in sarjapur road locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting

I think it also depends on where you are from. Maybe the service, available agents and delivery partners vary a lot from city to city? \n\nNevertheless, I still can't see any quick commerce becoming profitable unless they charge platform fees and other charges like the food delivery apps have started doing.

I never lost my money.\nI don't order from Zepto I have had many bad experiences.\nI had time one day and installed zepto and delivered for day . \n\nFirst thing is , the delivery guy can't do the delivery until he reaches the location. It's linked directly with the GPS. \n\nUntil you reach the location , the delivered option doesn't open in the delivery app. \n\nIn order to complete the delivery , you have to click a picture. \n\nI have 10 minutes to reach a location , even if it's means it's an apartment complex with 20 floors. And then I will have 6 minutes to go back to the zepto station. \n\nThe funny thing is , i can delay the order to the owner but can't delay going back to the station. If I'm delayed by a second , I get my incentives cut . For them thier bags are more important .\n\nAlso to the people , who put COD. Please , even in COD , do UPI payment . Don't give cash. \n\nBecause zepto doesn't accept cash. The rider has to pay zepto online. And most of these gig workers, don't have extra money lying around in the account . \n\nThe max , allowance Zepto gives is 500rs . After that account gets logged out. \n\nThese guys literally eat you up. I for a some idiotic reason took up delivery by walk . And after that day. Got extreme case of dengue and had to spend close 10k for my treatment and now I'm unable to walk due to the after effects of dengue . Extreme joint pains.\nZepto has COD option, don't pay until you get the order\nAlways opt for cod.

Well done.\nI'll tell you about something I witnessed in this city between a girl and an Uber driver. So I had booked a cab and the guy had accepted my ride but hers hadn't ended right. Now this girl refused to get down at her destination point and asked him to leave her at another gate of the same venue. So I sat down next to her and we drive a little extra to drop her at the gate she wanted. Then she didn't have that option where Uber automatically deducts your cab fare, so she asked the guy for scanner and pretended to make the payment. She said payment ho gaya before getting down, the cab driver nodded and she went inside. There was no tingtingtiding sound but I thought her phone could be on silent.

He was like mere ko online nahi samajhta, har din do teen log toh free ride le lete hai.

This middle age guy climbed 4 floors and came up , I felt so shocked because he could call me and tell me come down your buildings lift is having some issue but he didn\u2019t, after I took my order I thanked him and asked him if wanted to have water , he said no . So I went and opened my wallet and I had only 3 - 2000 notes so I gave him one , he was so thankful. I told him take the night off and enjoy with your family \ud83d\ude01\nbro ppl like you make me in believing theres always light at the end of tunnel.\nThat was touching. You\u2019re a good person.

Even when i contacted him first, he seemed flustered and spoke something about the previous customer scamming him. He didn't seem to want to talk, so I let it be. When he arrived an hour later, I recieved the order and made the payment (paid 100 rs extra because I saw him on Maps fiddling around a lot in confusing lanes). \n\nHe saw the amount and thanked me. He was preparing to leave when I asked about what happened with the previous customer. He sounded very low and explained how he had foolishly lost 2,000 rupees through an online transaction. Don't remember the specifics of the scam but he was an older guy, so it would be easy to fool him with virtual stuff. \n\nThere were slight tears in his eyes, i could see it clearly through his helm. i asked him if he was okay. \n\nThat's when he broke down. Said that 2,000 rupees is like a week's worth of profit for him. He said kya kar sakte hai bhai and again prepared to leave.\n\nI always feel bad for grown-ups who still haven't got their big break and it shattered my heart somewhat. I asked him for his scanner. He insisted that he didn't need anything and that he'll get it back with God's blessing. But after my request, he finally relented. \n\nI gave him back his 2,000 rupees and he broke down again. He kept folding his hands and asking for my number (I think he didn't know he could send me back the money by tracing his previous transactions). \n\nI kept descalating the situation by telling him that it's his money and he didn't need to return anything.

Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","13":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","14":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0[r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/\/)\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter.

More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

However, on the 9th of November, a Zepto delivery person arrived at my home with a package, even though nobody had placed any order that day. I was not at home at the time, and the delivery person handed over a package containing a pack of Parle biscuits and another type of biscuit to my family member, who was unaware of any such order. The delivery person requested and received Rs. 75 from my father for this unexpected delivery. My family members have never used Zepto, and only I had used the app until I uninstalled it.\n\nWhen my family member received the delivery, they called me to inform me about the unexpected order. I then tried contacting Zepto customer care to clarify the situation, but I was unable to connect with them in any way\u2014either by phone or message. After reaching home, I took the order package to the nearest Zepto hub, where I learned that the delivery person had delivered the order meant for a different customer. The delivery person explained that he had tried to call the customer, but no one answered the phone, so he delivered the order to my address. The total order was valued at Rs. 125, but the delivery person had taken only Rs. 75 and received the payment to his personal Google Pay account. I returned the order at the hub and got my Rs. 75 refunded.\n\nIs this a scam by Zepto or the delivery person?\n\n","16":"Can someone explain me what was this?

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo.

Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns.

They're not delivering my order it's been more than an hour. And it's not even raining.\n\nAnd to top all that there's no way to contact the customer support in the app. No way to talk to any agent. There's no option to even chat.\n\nI am so pissed right now I don't know what to do.","26":"Worst delivery app DUNZO Placed an order with dunzo \u2026. Took more than 2 hours to deliver stating there\u2019s no delivery partner . Unable to cancel cause the app said the order is processed . Tried to communicate with them but it\u2019s a one way communication with a bot which they did not even reply later.  \nAlso I realised after that I could get the same order in Zepto for a way lesser price which I later did and they were at least very responsive over the chat although there was a slight delay which I completely understand cause of the delay .\n\nPoint is , their customer service sucks and they should atleast give us an option to cancel the order is they cannot deliver it within the promised time. ","29":"Zepto\u2019s \u201c5-Minute\u201d Delivery: A Satirical Tale of Varna Minutes and Vanishing Riders \nYesterday, I had the honor of discovering Zepto\u2019s unique interpretation of time. You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. They are very clever to ensure that the phones time is not visible when you are on the app but I can assure you both. The screenshots are 15 minutes apart.","30":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Aug 19th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [other post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) in this subreddit with a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope.

So, I recently ordered some groceries from Zepto, because they have free delivery charges. But what I received was anything but fresh, several items were either rotten or close to it. I tried contacting their customer support, hoping for an easy refund, I was ready for replacement as well, but it seems like I have to beg just to get what I paid for.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences with Zepto or other quick commerce platforms? It\u2019s frustrating that they promise quality and speed, but if there\u2019s a problem, they\u2019re conveniently \u201cunavailable\u201d or dismissive. Why are these platforms allowed to operate this way? It feels like they\u2019re putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards.\n\nIs there any way to get them to take accountability. Or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service?","37":"India\u2019s startup boom despite global slowdown: Learnings from India\u2019s tech scenario in 2024 https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/omgh2g5giv0e1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a23e5e55b21a1d7c90605e625e83f548d4303a\n\nIndia\u2019s startup scene has shown that it can handle tough times even when the world economy slows down. In 2024, India became the 4th biggest tech hub in the world. While global markets have grappled with tighter financial conditions, India has weathered the storm, drawing on its innovative spirit and rapidly growing digital economy. Even though venture capital and private equity money dropped a bit \u2014 $7.6 billion in 2024 compared to $8.2 billion in 2023 \u2014 India still proves that it\u2019s a top spot for new ideas.\n\nThis article looks at how India\u2019s tech industry is going strong even when times are tough. It\u2019s getting a boost from growing areas like fintech, retail tech, and cleantech. Cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Gurugram still lead the way as crucibles of new ideas. We\u2019ll take a close look at Tracxn\u2019s 2024 India Tech Geo YTD Report and hear from industry experts, and learn about the trends, hurdles, and new chances that will shape the future of India\u2019s tech world.\n\n# India\u2019s tech world stays strong in 2024: Growing economy sparks new ideas\n\nAt the core of India\u2019s start-up success lies its strong economy, which will grow by 8.2 per cent in 2024, surpassing global growth rates. This economic strength has built a firm base for the country\u2019s growing tech scene, helping its start-ups to handle the financial troubles that have struck other big markets. India\u2019s dynamic business world, backed by its young and tech-smart people, has enabled it to deal with the global funding slowdown better than many other nations.\n\n# Investment trends and how decreased funding affects things\n\nEven though India\u2019s startup scene is still going strong, it took a hit with a 7 per cent drop in total funding \u2014 going from $8.2B in 2023 to $7.6B in 2024. This dip has led to a big change in where investors are putting their money. They\u2019re playing it safe now, giving $4.7 billion to more established companies. Meanwhile newer start-ups are feeling the pinch, with their funding taking a nosedive to $2.2 billion.\n\nThe global funding slowdown, which has an impact on geopolitical tensions and a tightening capital market, has pushed investors to focus on mature startups which have shown that they can scale. Pankaj Sharma CEO of Religare Finvest Ltd, contends, \u201cInvestors are drawn to companies that show openness, can adapt, and bounce back. This matters a lot in a shaky market where handling risks is key to growing in the long run.\u201d\n\n# Sectoral performance: Top performers and strugglers in 2024\n\n# Retail tech: Causing a revolution in customer experiences\n\nRetail tech stands out as one of India\u2019s top performers in 2024, pulling in $1.95 billion in funding \u2014 a 23 per cent jump from 2023. Flipkart and Meesho still lead the e-commerce scene, pushing growth through shopping experiences that use tech and cater to each person. Also, the boom in quick commerce has boosted companies like Zepto, which grabbed $665 million in funding this year. Zepto\u2019s super-fast grocery delivery shows how shoppers\u2019 wants to have changed, with speed and ease now being the key factors.\n\nRaja Singh Bhurji, CEO of The StepUp Ventures observes, \u201cBengaluru\u2019s mix of cultures, along with its global mindset, have helped start-ups to grow. The city\u2019s focus on learning and its pool of top talent allows start-ups to come up with new ideas and get more funding.\u201d Bengaluru\u2019s leading position in grabbing 35 per cent of the total funding in 2024, shows how much the city drives India\u2019s retail tech growth.\n\n# Fintech: Balancing new ideas and rules\n\nFintech has emerged as a key part of India\u2019s tech scene, attracting $1.49 billion in investments. The industry has seen quick digital uptake, pushed by offerings like digital fixed deposits (FDs), giving people new options to handle their money. Ravi Jain from Blostem thinks that the field\u2019s wins come from striking a balance between following rules and pushing tech forward. \u201cWe talk to regulators which lets us lead in new ideas while making sure that our products meet the criteria of the changing rules,\u201d he says.\n\n# Cleantech: The future of sustainability and electric mobility\n\nIndia\u2019s goal to reach Net-Zero emissions by 2070 has made cleantech a fast-growing industry, but it still faces big challenges. Pritesh Talwar, President of Lectrix EV, asserts, \u201cThe cleantech industry is still new in India, and scaling solutions like electric vehicles comes with issues such as high initial costs and worries about running out of power. However, these problems also create chances to come up with new ideas.\u201d Lectrix EV\u2019s Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) model is one such new idea, which has cut the cost of owning an electric two-wheeler (E2W) a lot by offering flexible leasing and swapping options.\n\nLectrix EV aims to create a lasting ecosystem, not just electric vehicles. They\u2019ve set up 250 battery swap stations in Delhi and want to add 400 more throughout India. This network has strategic placements to lessen range anxiety, which stops many people from buying EVs.\n\n# Aerospace and defence: Public-private partnerships and emerging technologies\n\nIndia\u2019s aerospace & defence sector is changing. Public-private partnerships and a focus on self-reliance are driving this change. The Make in India programme has pushed for more domestic production. Simultaneously, AI and robotics advances are reshaping our defence capabilities. Kiran Rudrappa, CEO of Posspole, says: \u201cThe government\u2019s Strategic Partnership model and public-private collaborations are critical for driving innovation in the aerospace sector. AI and robotics are key to enhancing India\u2019s defence efficiency.\u201d Yet, the sector still faces money problems. Companies are now looking to use government plans like iDEX to back new ideas.\n\nRead the full article:\u00a0[https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/](https:\/\/smefutures.com\/indias-startup-boom-despite-global-slowdown-learnings-from-indias-tech-scenario-in-2024\/)","38":"Zepto: High Time For You To Turn Ethical This experience is a culmination of several bad and unfulfilled deliveries by Zepto (as a quick-commerce provider) operating in Sarjapur Road locality here in Bengaluru in particular and across India in general. Zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service; however, it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least. One day it is poor Quality Control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies \/ fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 15-20 mins minimum to even reach your community \/ apartment even during non-peak hours. Their Customer Support Team does not have any empathy to begin with. They tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie Customer Support Associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced Customer Support Associate who will start a seemingly never-ending saga of questions and unnecessary cross-checks with their internal logistics and quality control teams - all when you are still on chat with them. The whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on Zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 30-45 minutes in trying to relay their concerns and\/or reach a closure. I also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code \u201cFree Delivery\u201d before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have Zepto membership or not. One has to wonder as to why so forward-thinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such tech-savvy quick commerce apps COULD NOT apply a simple auto-logic to apply \u201cFree Delivery\u201d as and when a customer or patron\u2019s cart value reaches minimum order value by default. These practices not only expose Zepto\u2019s dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers\u2019 money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value. Zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers\u2019 hard-earned money using cheap con tricks. This is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating!!!\n\nHope this effort to expose Zepto and its greedy intentions create some much-needed noise and uproar amongst Zepto\u2019s senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\u2026\n\n  #TimeToChangeZepto #StopCheating","39":"How Zepto Scammed me  I recently placed a Zepto order which included Anveshan A2 Desi Cow ghee price of which is \u20b9992 \nNow I invited my friend to Zepto and got a \u20b9200 as refer and earn coupon which I redeemed so this ghee costed me \u20b9803 including the handling fees\n\nBut the product delivered to me was different from what I had ordered it was Halilkar ghee which is actually \u20b9125 cheaper than ghee I had ordered \nSo raised a complaint with customer service but they refused to refund me the difference amount.\n\nThe executive then started convincing me that product I recieved is correct and only the packaging is different. Am I stupid that I would believe in that it is clearly different, there is even a seal on product.\n\nLater on executive initiated a return without my consent and then I had to forcefully give it back to Zepto delivery partner.\n\nAs I returned this item not only my \u20b9200 coupon which I redeemed is gone but also they didn't refund the handling fees.\nWhat kind of handling fees when you can't even deliver correct product.\n\nAnd they say they will deliver iPhones in 10 mins no one would ever trust Zepto to buy an iPhone.\n","40":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 19th, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n\n\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** China couriers\u00a0delivered over 100 billion parcels\u00a0so far this year, hitting the milestone 71 days earlier than in 2023. This volume equates to 71.43 packages per person, 5,144 parcels per second, and 440 million packages per day. \u2013 According to the State Post Bureau\n___\n**Klarna** is giving customers the option to add money from their bank account to a new digital wallet called Klarna Balance. The company also introduced a cash-back rewards program where customers can earn up to 10% cash back when using the Klarna app to shop at participating retailers. In Europe, Klarna already has a banking license, has offered similar services in Germany since 2021, and is now expanding. It'll offer customers interest rates as high as 3.58% for savings. In the US, Klarna doesn't have a banking license and is operating through partner banks. Its banking services will be limited and more comparable to a digital wallet than a savings account in the US, as the money held isn't protected by the FDIC. There is also no interest offered to US customers.\n___\n**TikTok** users in the US who invite their creator friends to join the app can now get up to $300 in discounts or a $100 Amazon gift card for every new creator they refer. Users are rewarded after an eligible creator (YouTubers with 10K subscribers and Instagrammers with 100K followers) accepts and joins TikTok\u2019s 1 Min+ Growth Program using the invitation code. Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media today wrote that the incentive, \u201cseems a little desperate, and a little like TikTok is running out of ideas for growth, given that it\u2019s resorting to cash rewards and discounts to get more users across.\u201d Personally, I don't think that the move screams desperation. I'm a big proponent of offering referral commissions to grow memberships. However I question whether this particular promotion will be effective. Does TikTok think that YouTubers with 10k subscribers and Instagrammers with 100k followers haven't heard of TikTok before? And that the push they've been looking for is a sign-up link from a fellow creator?\n___\n**In other TikTok News\u2026** The company rolled out group chats that support up to 32 participants, aiming to enhance user interaction by allowing friends and family to connect more easily on the platform and eliminate the need for third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp to share and discuss videos.\n___\n**FTC** announced final rules to combat fake reviews and testimonials by prohibiting their sale or purchase. The new rules will also allow the agency to seek civil penalties against known violators. The rules prohibit fake consumer reviews, buying or selling reviews, insider reviews, misrepresentation of company-controlled review websites, and review suppression. FTC Chair Lina Khan wrote, \u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors. By strengthening the FTC\u2019s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201d See my [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ecommerce\/comments\/1ewdwde\/the_ftc_announced_final_rules_to_combat_fake\/) on the r\/ecommerce subreddit for a deeper dive into the new rules. \n___\n**SoundCloud** launched a merch marketplace called SoundCloud Store that will allow artists to sell their own designs and fan merch. The first edition of the store features designs from Wiz Khalifa, Denzel Curry, wolfacejoeyy, Bktherula, Armani White, and other people I've never heard of before. The artist submits a design, SoundCloud creates mock-ups for them and then produces the goods for the artist and lists the items for sale in its SoundCloud store. From there, SoundCloud handles fan engagement and social promotion for the merch. The service currently does not take any fee from the artists and passes on 100% of the profits from sales. \n___\n**Amazon** is experimenting with removing customer star ratings from its product search results page, which the company says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its selection of products. Either that, or Amazon is inadvertently admitting that most of its reviews are fake \/ paid for and wants to put less emphasis on them. Amazon told Fortune that the \u201climited test\u201d only affects a small set of products and only affects the search results page, while the star ratings and review count totals are still available on the individual product pages. \n___\n**X** is closing its operations in Brazil, but keeping the social media service available in the country for the time being, according to a post from its (@)GlobalAffairs account, which wrote: \u201cLast night, Alexandre de Moraes threatened our legal representative in Brazil with arrest if we do not comply with his censorship orders. He did so in a secret order, which we share here to expose his actions. Despite our numerous appeals to the Supreme Court not being heard, the Brazilian public not being informed about these orders and our Brazilian staff having no responsibility or control over whether content is blocked on our platform, Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process. As a result, to protect the safety of our staff, we have made the decision to close our operation in Brazil, effective immediately.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok** is urging a federal appellate court in Washington DC to block the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which will effectively ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance doesn't divest the app to an American-owned company by April. TikTok calls the statute \u201cthe most sweeping speech restriction in this country\u2019s history\u201d and claims that it \u201csingles out and shutters a speech platform used by 170 million Americans.\u201d In its new filing last Thursday, TikTok's legal team claimed that the US is illegally singling out TikTok and that the government's fears are speculative and lack hard evidence. The Justice Department\u2019s legal papers include large sections that have been redacted for containing classified information, and the DOJ has previously asked the court to keep key evidence under seal since it involves a \u201ctop secret\u201d classified designation.\n___\n**Nood**, an American bra brand known for its adhesive bras, nipple covers, and boob tape, is spearheading a campaign to shed light on the adverse impact of advertising policies enforced by Google, Facebook, and TikTok. In the past year, Nood claims that its business has been negatively impacted by having their products and ads categorized as sexual in nature, indecent, or inappropriate, which has resulted in censorship, shadow bans, and removal of their advertisements. This one's tough to judge. On one hand, I understand where Nood is coming from. Just because their products are made for women's breasts doesn't intrinsically make their products sexual in nature. On the other hand, some of Nood's ads are objectively sexualized, designed to make the viewer think at first glance that the woman is topless, only to look closer and discover that she's wearing a skin tone nipple cover. Many users wouldn't consider this type of content appropriate for their feeds, and platforms have a responsibility to their users (and other advertisers) to only show content that adheres to their community guidelines.\n___\n**Spotify**\u00a0is\u00a0attempting to compete\u00a0with TikTok, Instagram, and other video networks for video ads, according to a leaked deck which revealed that the music-streaming service is seeking a larger slice of video ad budgets. Spotify reported its most profitable quarter ever after a 13% increase in ad sales and 12% growth in subscribers to its premium tier, but ad-sales growth slowed from an 18% increase in Q1. Advertising currently makes up 12% of Spotify's total revenue, and the company wants to get that number to 20%.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0redesigned its search experience\u00a0to make it more intuitive and \u201cvisually rich\u201d featuring larger, higher-resolution images, streamlined navigation, and a more modern layout. The new main search page makes large product images the focus point, while the new Shopping View replaces the previous gallery view, providing a full-width display without sidebar ads so that shoppers can browse visual categories like clothing, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.\n___\n**More than one-third of back-to-school shopping**\u00a0happens online now, with Amazon capturing more market share and dethroning Target as the second-biggest retailer for back-to-school supplies behind Walmart, according to a report by Numerator. E-commerce accounted for more than 37% of school supply shopping in 2023, up from 23% in 2019.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0started\u00a0allowing alcohol advertisements\u00a0in the US under a new policy that permits alcohol and alcohol-branded merchandise to be advertised to users 25 years old and older. Despite the updated rules, TikTok's policy on branded content remains the same, which prohibits influencers from promoting alcohol and requires alcohol brands to disable comments on their posts to avoid interaction with underage users.\n___\n**The Biden administration**\u00a0unveiled new rules and efforts\u00a0targeting consumer annoyances ranging from hard-to-cancel subscriptions, long insurance forms, and not being able to get a human customer service agent on the phone in a reasonable amount of time. The new \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative is aimed at cracking down on endless hold times or deliberately complicated procedures that cost consumers.\n___\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt**\u00a0told students\u00a0at Stanford University that they should use large language models to replicate TikTok's algorithm and \u201csteal\u201d the company's intellectual property, and that everything would be fine as long as they had lawyers to sort things out. He later asked for the now-deleted video to be taken down and clarified his comments by saying, \u201cSo in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody\u2019s music. What you would do if you\u2019re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you\u2019d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn\u2019t matter that you stole all the content.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon's Prime Day**\u00a0beat other retailers'\u00a0summer promotional events in regards to loyalty and participation. Amazon customers spent a record $14.2B during the event, which marks an 11% increase YoY, and 84% of shoppers who made purchases during the summer events only bought items at Amazon. However when it came to average spend per customer,\u00a0**Wayfair**\u00a0had the lead with $281, followed by\u00a0**Walmart**\u00a0at $101,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0at $89,\u00a0**Target**\u00a0at $76, and\u00a0**TikTok Shop**\u00a0at $53.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a platform fee of Rs3 (around 4 cents) on its marketplace, following in the footsteps of quick commerce companies Swiggy, Zomato, and Zepto. The fee is uniform across basket sizes and has not yet been introduced for Flipkart Grocery or its travel site, Cleartrip. The company says that the fee is a nominal charge to \u201csustain efficient operations\u201d and improve user experience.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0and its drone delivery partner DroneUp are\u00a0ending drone delivery\u00a0in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa to focus on perfecting the delivery model in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is emerging as the capital of drone delivery in America. 70 employees are losing their jobs in those cities, and the reduction will cut DroneUp's delivery service to 15 Walmart locations including 11 in Dallas, 3 near Bentonville, and one in Virginia Beach, where DroneUp is based. Two weeks ago I\u00a0reported\u00a0that the mayor of College Station, Texas is urging the FAA to slow down an effort by Amazon Prime Air to expand its drone delivery operations in the city after residents expressed concerns to the City Council regarding drone noise levels, particularly during take-off and landing.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0giving buyers the ability\u00a0to cancel their orders before the items get marked as shipped, which means that sellers better update the tracking information on orders quickly. Currently buyers can use the cancel order button in cases where they purchased the item within the last hour and the seller has not shipped yet, but now there will no longer be a 1-hour limit, and the button will be available until tracking information is added. What a horrible policy! Now sellers have to monitor their eBay dashboards in real-time while picking and packing orders in fear that the buyer will cancel before they have a chance to update the order with tracking info? Can we just put eBay out of its misery at this point?\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac550k\u00a0in compensation to a former senior executive in Ireland for his unfair dismissal following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company. Back in November 2022, Musk had sent all staff an e-mail prompting them to \u201cclick yes on the link below\u201d if they want to be part of the new Twitter, and the company says that former employee Gary Rooney resigned when he failed to tick the box. However Rooney claimed that it required him to agree to new and unspecified pay and conditions within a one-day deadline.\n___\n**Radio ads**\u00a0beat Facebook by 2.6x\u00a0in consumer attention, according to a new study by Adelaide. The firm's study revealed that to achieve the same level of attentiveness that $1,000 spent on AM\/FM radio advertising provides, an advertiser would have to spend $1,313 on X or $2,635 on Facebook. The study also found that radio ads nearly match the attentiveness levels of television.\n___\n**Thailand's government**\u00a0is\u00a0inviting\u00a0key e-commerce platform operators to discuss the impact of low-cost imported products from China, following a resolution instructing state agencies to find new measures to ease the impact of the influx of Chinese products on local manufacturers. Various regulatory agencies from Thailand will join the meeting with the e-commerce companies, which will include representatives from Lazada, Shopee, and Temu.\n___\n**Zepto**, an India-based online grocery delivery service that delivers orders within 10 minutes, is\u00a0working on expanding\u00a0its product selection from 10k items to more than 20k items within a month, preparing for the upcoming festive season in the country. In addition to groceries, Zepto currently lists a limited range of general merchandise, cosmetics, electronics, toys, and home goods, but it plans to increase its selection of items in those categories as India approaches Diwali.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0launched a pilot program\u00a0in partnership with NCMEC that will display Amber Alerts directly within the For You feed, providing more coverage to missing persons in the app. The new program will initially begin in Texas before expanding to other regions. Do you think TikTok will play that annoying\u00a0Amber Alert sound? Or will they use trending music? The latter would be a much better way to keep users from scrolling past the video.\u00a0\n___\n**Pivotree**, a global company that helps build and manage digital platforms for commerce, data management, and supply chain,\u00a0partnered\u00a0with\u00a0**Shopify**\u00a0as a technology partner to implement and migrate enterprise customers to the Shopify platform. The new alliance will enable large global brands to transition to Shopify more easily from legacy platforms.\n___\n**Turkey**\u00a0is the\u00a0latest country\u00a0to raise customs duty rates and reduce de minimis in an attempt to give local retailers a leg up against Shein and Temu. President Erdo\u011fan signed the new law, reducing the de minimis exception from $164 to $33, effective August 21st, while increasing the country's import duty on European packages from 18% to 30% and the tax rate on goods originating from outside the EU from 30% to 60%.\n___\n**X's**\u00a0estimated ad revenue\u00a0dropped $238M\u00a0so far in 2024, which can only be described as an \u201cepic fail\u201d by Elon Musk. Advertisers have spent almost $744M on X during its first six months of 2024, which is 24% lower than the $982M spent in the first half of 2023. Apparently telling advertisers to \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d isn't a great way to get them to up their ad spend.\n___\n**In other X news\u2026**\u00a0a US District Judge in Texas\u00a0recused himself\u00a0from a lawsuit filed by X after NPR drew scrutiny to the judge's investment in Tesla. Judge Reed O'Connor reported receiving a dividend from Tesla in 2022 of $15,000 or less. In his two-sentence order stepping aside from the Musk case, he did not offer an explanation.\n___\n**The European Union**\u00a0asked\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0for information about the way it shares data from its social media platforms with researchers, a request relating to a probe that officials launched earlier this year into Meta's compliance with the region's Digital Services Act. Through its request, the EU is seeking more details about Meta's Content Library, a web portal that allows researchers to access certain information about user posts on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has until Sept 6th to provide the information.\n___\n**Mercari**, the Japanese marketplace that allows users to buy and sell new and used items, is\u00a0making Japanese inventory\u00a0available to shoppers on its US marketplace, and opening a retail store in Los Angeles. The company said that Mercari x Japan is a new product offering that will open up direct access to inventory from millions of Japanese sellers with products like apparel, sneakers, handbags, toys, comics, and more.\u00a0\n___\n**Rivian**\u00a0paused production\u00a0of its electric van, which it built for Amazon, due to a parts shortage that began earlier this month. The company declined to say exactly which components were in short supply, which is pretty smart, as I'd imagine other folks would start buying those parts up right away, furthering the shortage. Rivian did not provide a timeline for when it'll begin production again.\n___\n**Shein**\u00a0hired\u00a0former EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger to navigate regulatory hurdles in Europe and bolster its lobbying efforts in the region ahead of its London IPO, as the EU considers new import duties that would impact its business. Shein spent about $2.5M on lobbying in the US and EU last year.\n___\n**58% of crypto ads on Facebook**\u00a0are for scams, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which shocked no-one. The report alleges that Meta is well aware of what is going on and chooses to turn a blind eye. The ACCC has decided to sue Meta over the issue, claiming that the company refuses to take the matter seriously and only generates action when asked or warned to do so.\n___\n**Temu**\u00a0overtook\u00a0**eBay**\u00a0to become the 2nd most visited e-commerce website in the world, which is especially wild given that most of Temu's sales happen within its app.\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0also\u00a0beat out\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0for budget-conscious consumers in a new report, which found that shoppers who purchased from both marketplaces think that Temu is cheaper, but Amazon is more convenient.\u00a0\n___\n**Hellmann's,**\u00a0the maker of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and other condiments, is\u00a0launching\u00a0the world's first (and probably last) mayonnaise-inspired fragrance that \u201csmells like greatness\u201d in a partnership with NFL quarterback Will Levis, its new brand ambassador. Levis famously put mayo in his coffee when he began working with Hellmann's last year, and now the two companies are trying to see just how gross they can take things. \n___\nPlus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Trove**, a resale platform that works with brands like Patagonia and Levi's,\u00a0acquiring **Recurate**, a competing resale platform, for an undisclosed amount. Trove specializes in a fully managed model of resale, handling the entire secondhand commerce journey start to finish on behalf of its clients, whereas Recurate offers brands a peer-to-peer resale model that doesn't require inventory management or photographing listings, allowing for an easier integration of resale into an existing e-commerce platform.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

I requested an exchange for a larger size (XL), but they outright refused. Their reasoning? The item delivered matched my order, so they won\u2019t process a return or exchange.\n\nI explained that the size doesn\u2019t fit me well and suggested they offer a basic exchange\u2014something standard in fashion e-commerce. But they wouldn\u2019t budge. To make matters worse, their customer support ended the chat abruptly and rudely, as if I were asking for something unreasonable or free.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering ordering fashion items from quick commerce platforms like Zepto, think twice. Their rigid policies and poor customer support might not be worth the hassle.. ","43":"Blinkit is better than Zepto any day I wanted to order some items from Zepto, and I noticed there was \u20b9100 free cash available. I was excited, but Zepto isn\u2019t letting me use it. it keeps saying 'temporarily unavailable.' Even now, it\u2019s still not working. It feels like Zepto is trying to attract as many customers as possible to compete with Blinkit, but seriously, their customer support is pathetic. Is there any solution to this problem so I can use the free cash? ","45":"New Zepto Scam?

I don\u2019t see such a thing with Instamart. \n\nShouldn\u2019t Zepto minus the delivery fee by default? \nTheir customer support is arrogant as usual when you reach out.\n\nAnyone else who faced this?\n","46":"Never gonna use again Zepto  So,  This is about today \n\nI was super hungry at Night so I ordered 3 item \nAnd made payment at 12.53 am and gone outside house to thinking abhi 5 min me to aajayega \n\nI waited 10 min then other 5  when it's already 17 min done I messaged to customer support team\n\nThen they start apologise and sorry about that still I understand they give me time and I waited again that time still not received....I called delivery partner he is also not receiving call\n\nI Got super frustrated \nAnd started yelling on customer support \nThey showing another time and vice versa\n\nThey trying to buy my frustrated mental health with 50 rupees compensation \nI said okay give and then I said when I receive my order they gave another time again I waited and guess what not received any delivery call\n\nThen I m totally done \nYou can see chats with customer executive I was already hungry and got this shiit\n\nThen they showing me mercy with 100 rupees compensation wow so much amount \n\nYou fu**king guys just break someone hope and break a customer relationship \nStill not received my order it's been 2 hour that what zepto 10 min delivery haha \n\nKeep my money zepto management I don't want refund you much needed with this kind of activity \n\nSo be Aware if you want this type of Mental Trauma when you are hungry too \n Thank you \n(Sry for my bad english)","47":"Zepto scam in india Recently a thing has been happening to me.

What to do","51":"Got scammed by zepto Idk which subreddit this post is most suitable for, but:\nI bought a Philips One blade from zepto today and received a package with broken seal instead replaced by regular tape. By the time I noticed this, the delivery guy had taken off.\n\nOpened the package to find the blade missing which is supposed to come with the package. Customer support refuses to help. I know nothing can be done now cause I accepted the package when I wasn't supposed to, nor did I record myself unboxing it. Needless to say, never ordering from zepto again in my life.\n\nAny suitable advice would be appreciated thanks\n\nEdit: sorry forgot to make the title a question "},"all_text":{"0":"toxic work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information technology act 2000\nnext byjus in the making \ud83e\udd14\nsince its being openly talked of i think i recently dodged a bullet here \n\ni had interviews scheduled with someone on a very senior position for a pretty senior position in one of the core departments the person who was supposed to take the interviews didnt show up and not once but thrice in three different time slots\ud83e\udd37\n\nafter the third noshow i told the hr to get their business in order first and then think of anything else\n\ni guess i should be thanking him now \ud83d\ude05\n\nedit with the

overcharging customers  my shocking experience \n\nhey everyone\n\ni wanted to share a disturbing experience i had with zepto recently and i feel its important for others to be aware\n\ni ordered two

charges totally fake shizz\n\non top of that even though im a zepto pass member which is supposed to give me free delivery on orders above 199 they still charged me a delivery fee of 27 and heres the kickerthe gst on this delivery fee was 1728 how does that make sense gst on 27 shouldnt be that high\n\ni feel completely cheated its not just about a few extra rupees its about trust and honesty if a company is willing to overcharge and sneak in extra fees what else are they doing behind the scenes\n\ni reached out to customer service but they werent helpful this isnt the kind of service i expected especially from a company that prides itself on convenience and customer satisfaction\n\nim sharing this to warn others\n\ncheck your bills carefully dont assume the charges are correct\n\nspeak up if something seems off companies need to know we wont tolerate being overcharged\n\n\nhas anyone else experienced this with zepto or other delivery apps lets hold them accountable\n\n\n\n\n first thing cigarettes are not included in zepto pass second thing you are just overreacting its clear in the breakdown 680  25 gst and 27 rs as delivery cost how is it a scam dude\nas someone who never smoked thanks for making me realise how much money im saving\npeople literally talk shit because the guy smokes if it was something else in his cart every reply wouldve

infested record a video and send an email escalation to the grievance officer of zepto and warning that if the issue is not resolved will report to relevant food authorities and social media handles\n\nhad this issue with instamart and blinkit got it resolved on priority\nzepto swiggy instamart are good for once in while urgent situations we should always buy groceries and veggies fruits

started correcting me for my betterment and he hand picked best of the fruits and gave me 1200 grams for 1kg price which is just 70 those looks like local nati produce i could sense freshness in every

experienced a fraud from zepto where delivery guy will say order is delivered even without actually delivering the order  and worst part is customer care will not take any action and you will end up losing the money \nwhen i had reported the issue to the customer care person she said the delivery guy has delivered the order and received the cash from me  which is very weird because the order was a prepaid order and after telling multiple times times the delivery person is lying zepto didnt do anything  they show like its your fault and you end up losing your money\n\nzepto is the worst

experiences\ni had time one day and installed zepto and delivered for day  \n\nfirst thing is  the delivery guy cant do the delivery until he reaches the location its linked directly with the gps \n\nuntil you reach the location  the delivered option doesnt open in the delivery app \n\nin order to complete the delivery  you have to click a picture \n\ni have 10 minutes to reach a location

months ago \n\ni had portered some stuff not heavy duty from a friend who lived on the other side of the city even when i contacted him first he seemed flustered and spoke something about the previous customer scamming him he didnt seem to want to talk so i let it be when he arrived an hour later i recieved the order and made the payment paid 100 rs extra because i saw him on maps fiddling around a lot in confusing lanes \n\nhe saw the amount and thanked me he was preparing to leave when i asked about what happened with the previous customer he sounded very low and explained how he had foolishly lost 2000 rupees through an online transaction dont remember the specifics of the scam but he was an older guy so it would be easy to fool him with virtual stuff \n\nthere were slight tears in his eyes i could see it clearly through his helm i asked him if he was okay \n\nthats when he broke down said that 2000 rupees is like a weeks worth of profit for him he said kya kar sakte hai bhai and again prepared to leave\n\ni always feel bad for grownups who still havent got their big break and it shattered my heart somewhat i asked him for his scanner he insisted that he didnt need anything and that hell get it back with gods blessing but after my request he finally relented \n\ni gave him back his 2000 rupees and he broke down again he kept folding his hands and asking for my number i think he didnt know he could send me back the money by tracing his previous transactions \n\ni kept descalating the situation by telling him that its his money and he didnt need to return anything the way he cried was sincere and struck me deeply\n\ni learner the hard way that delhi is not for the bighearted and choose very carefully whom to help but this dude sounded genuine\n\nwhat do you guys think even if the story was fake and hes a master orchestrator i still think i wouldnt be able to rest well that day if i hadnt helped him  on a serious note youre a good dude champ well done\nill tell you about something i witnessed in this city between a girl and an uber driver so i had booked a cab and the guy had accepted my ride but hers hadnt ended right now this girl refused to get down at her destination point and asked him to leave her at another gate of the same venue so i sat down next to her and we drive a little extra to drop her at the gate she wanted then she didnt have that option where uber automatically deducts your cab fare so she asked the guy for scanner and pretended to make the payment she said payment ho gaya before getting down the cab driver nodded and she went inside there was no tingtingtiding sound but i thought her phone could be on silent also if im ever paying like this i always show my phone screen to whom im making the payment so they can double check\u00a0when we have gone further the guy says amount toh abhi tak aaya nahi and i was like tab kyun nahi bola baad mein thodi aata hai immediate transfer hota he was like mere ko online nahi samajhta har din do teen log toh free ride le lete hai in any other major city the cab guy would create a scene over this and with the reputation delhi has how could he be this bhola even if he came from somewhere else or whatever and its happening on a daily basis with him\ni read the post about the zepto guy  but what you did seems quite genuine and honest  23 years back i was in delhi and we had ordered food  the past few years ive lived in societies so i find it very weird if someone climbs stares and comes  this middle age guy climbed 4 floors and came up  i felt so shocked because he could call me and tell me come down your buildings lift is having some issue but he didnt after i took my order i thanked him and asked him if wanted to have water  he said no  so i went and opened my wallet and i had only 3  2000 notes so i gave him one  he was so thankful i told him take the night off and enjoy with your family \ud83d\ude01\nbro ppl like you make me in believing theres always

comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso you cannot do much in this case what the card classifies for the rewards its upto them try with customers care call and email and tell them you will

with zepto expecting fresh vegetables for my family but what arrived was far from freshcompletely spoiled rotten and unusable i was shocked at the poor quality especially considering the premium i paid for this delivery service\n\nwhen i contacted their customer care team to report the issue i was met with the rudest response imaginable instead of offering a solution or even an apology the representative i spoke with dismissed my concerns entirely and made no effort to rectify the situation it felt like they just didnt care about their customers or the quality of their service\n\nive never experienced such bad customer service i wanted to share this to warn others who might be considering using zeptothis is not the kind of service you expect from a company that promises

some new friends learned how zepto works and stopped using zepto all together sorry for you op\nand they constantly keep shoving the zepto pass in your ass\ni stopped using zepto when they sent clearly rotten vegetables twice and refused to give me a refund all they said was a generic we will ensure this does not happen in the future deleted my account and uninstalled the app zepto was the first fast delivery app but man have they gone to the gutter\nzepto customer care teams are the worst i have ordered two items and one chocolate bar was missing when the item reached home i contacted the support and they asked me to send the picture of the package lol how can i send the picture of the missing item then they said that the item was there when it was delivered it seems also the item

they have free delivery charges but what i received was anything but fresh several items were either rotten or close to it i tried contacting their customer support hoping for an easy refund i was ready for replacement as well but it seems like i have to beg just to get what i paid for\n\nhas anyone else had similar experiences with zepto or other quick commerce platforms its frustrating that they promise quality and speed but if theres a problem theyre conveniently unavailable or dismissive why are these platforms allowed to operate this way it feels like theyre putting profit over customer satisfaction and basic quality standards\n\nis there any way to get them to take accountability or is it too much to ask for fresh food and reliable service india has such a large population that hitting the ceiling on consumer signup takes years probably which gives them enough confidence to not bother about consumers experience\nonce i was ordering few items like milkcurd and some biscuits and some ten chocolate breads like a loaf or something and it all came upto just 70 bucks or something at first i didnt think anything of itbut when i received the package all the items except the milk and the curd were due to expire the next day i immediately reached out and stated this issue and guess what they said you can consume all these items today

locality here in bengaluru in particular and across india in general zepto had a good start and we were quite happy and content with their service however it is turning to be a shoddy and inefficient service team to say the least one day it is poor quality control where stale or overly frozen and soggy veggies  fruits are delivered in the name of fresh produce and another day it is the deceptive marketing timer that shows your groceries will reach you in 5 mins time to cover a distance of 300 meters whilst the harsh reality is that they take nearly 1520 mins minimum to even reach your community  apartment even during nonpeak hours their customer support team does not have any empathy to begin with they tend to waste several minutes of your valuable time forcing you to interact with brainless chatbots and rookie customer support associates before actually allowing you to share your ordeal or bad experience with an experienced customer support associate who will start a seemingly neverending saga of questions and unnecessary crosschecks with their internal logistics and quality control teams  all when you are still on chat with them the whole purpose of ordering groceries and essentials on zepto gets defeated for anyone having to spend 3045 minutes in trying to relay their concerns andor reach a closure i also doubt their unethical and fraudulent practices of mandating every consumer to apply code free delivery before placing their orders even when they have exceeded minimum cart value to be eligible for free deliveries irrespective of whether they have zepto membership or not one has to wonder as to why so forwardthinking founders involved and such sharp brains behind building such techsavvy quick commerce apps could not apply a simple autologic to apply free delivery as and when a customer or patrons cart value reaches minimum order value by default these practices not only expose zeptos dark business practices but endless greed to swindle gullible customers money by shadily and secretly levying charges for deliveries inspite of customers being eligible for free deliveries basis their overall final cart value zepto is simply using unfair trade loopholes and technical thresholds as excuses to steal customers hardearned money using cheap con tricks this is broad daylight loot and blatant cheating\n\nhope this effort to expose zepto and its greedy intentions create some muchneeded noise and uproar amongst zeptos senior leadership and they put an end to their brazen looting practices that have been going on for far too long\n\n  timetochangezepto stopcheating had very similar experiences with zepto instamart blinkit etc similar locality\n\nwe were wasting so much time in finding the right product across apps talking to their disinterested support team when quality wasnt good which was most of the time lately and we were throwing away a considerable portion of fresh vegetables and fruits due to bad quality\n\nsince the last few weeks we have gone back to simpler times visiting a super market once or twice a week 2 hrs of effort each week also you should compare the pricing we are saving 810k a month decent side benefit in my opinion","39":"how zepto scammed me  i recently placed a zepto order which included anveshan a2 desi cow ghee price of which is 992 \nnow i invited my friend to zepto and got a 200 as

actually 125 cheaper than ghee i had ordered \nso raised a complaint with customer service but they refused to refund me the difference amount\n\nthe executive then started convincing me that product

regarding the same they said you can use the cash after you successfully place 2 orders i mean anyways i got a free coffee atleast today so zepto is better\nindeed \n\nzepto is all animations and a little show tried it a few times but eventually deleted it \n\nusing blinkit now and then","45":"new zepto scam is this a joke\n\nwhen you have a pass for any grocery app the delivery charge is waived off by default when its applicable \n\nzepto used to waive the delivery fee by the default until recently theyve started giving an option to waive it off i dont see such a thing with instamart \n\nshouldnt zepto minus the delivery fee by default \ntheir customer support is arrogant as usual when you reach out\n\nanyone else who faced this\n they prey on the negligence of the people \ud83e\udd21\nnot zepto user but if there are limited free delivery on pass then this button is valid else they are just trying to loot extra money\nits a common dark pattern found in videogames that have predatory practices  you still have to hit apply on free delivery after paying for the pass many would forget to do that someone should drag them to court over it or drag their name through mud for them to make it a default option for pass holders \n\nfuckers are learning terrible things from big gaming companies this practice will be adopted by other apps too if these greedy idiots arent shamed enough\nzepto is ruining its name by introducing new features\nlmao what is handling fee if they are charging delivery fee","46":"never gonna use again zepto  so  this is about today \n\ni was

when i checked the contents in the box i found that 1 green funds token is missing i connected with the customer support and asked for replacement but they dont have any stock to replace i can retuen

work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information technology act 2000\nnext byjus in the making \ud83e\udd14\nsince its being openly talked of i think i recently dodged a bullet here \n\ni had interviews scheduled with someone on a very senior position for a pretty senior position in one of the core departments the person who was supposed to take the interviews didnt show up and not once but thrice in three different time slots\ud83e\udd37\n\nafter the third noshow i told the hr to get their business in order first and then think of anything else\n\ni guess i should be thanking him now \ud83d\ude05\n\nedit with the

broke down and thought of sharing a similar incident that took place some 45 months ago \n\ni had portered some stuff not heavy duty from a friend who lived on the other side of the city even when i contacted him first he seemed flustered and spoke something about the previous customer scamming him he didnt seem to want to talk so i let it be when he arrived an hour later i recieved the order and made the payment paid 100 rs extra because i saw him on maps fiddling around a lot in confusing lanes \n\nhe saw the amount and thanked me he was preparing to leave when i asked about what happened with the previous customer he sounded very low and explained how he had foolishly lost 2000 rupees through an online transaction dont remember the specifics of the scam but he was an older guy so it would be easy to fool him with virtual stuff \n\nthere were slight tears in his eyes i could see it clearly through his helm i asked him if he was okay \n\nthats when he broke down said that 2000 rupees is like a weeks worth of profit for him he said kya kar sakte hai bhai and again prepared to leave\n\ni always feel bad for grownups who still havent got their big break and it shattered my heart somewhat i asked him for his scanner he insisted that he didnt need anything and that hell get it back with gods blessing but after my request he finally relented \n\ni gave him back his 2000 rupees and he broke down again he kept folding his hands and asking for my number i think he didnt know he could send me back the money by tracing his previous transactions \n\ni kept descalating the situation by telling him that its his money and he didnt need to return anything the way he cried was sincere and struck me deeply\n\ni learner the hard way that delhi is not for the bighearted and choose very carefully whom to help but this dude sounded genuine\n\nwhat do you guys think even if the story was fake and hes a master orchestrator i still think i wouldnt be able to rest well that day if i hadnt helped him  on a serious note youre a good dude champ well done\nill tell you about something i witnessed in this city between a girl and an uber driver so i had booked a cab and the guy had accepted my ride but hers hadnt ended right now this girl refused to get down at her destination point and asked him to leave her at another gate of the same venue so i sat down next to her and we drive a little extra to drop her at the gate she wanted then she didnt have that option where uber automatically deducts your cab fare so she asked the guy for scanner and pretended to make the payment she said payment ho gaya before getting down the cab driver nodded and she went inside there was no tingtingtiding sound but i thought her phone could be on silent also if im ever paying like this i always show my phone screen to whom im making the payment so they can double check\u00a0when we have gone further the guy says amount toh abhi tak aaya nahi and i was like tab kyun nahi bola baad mein thodi aata hai immediate transfer hota he was like mere ko online nahi samajhta har din do teen log toh free ride le lete hai in any other major city the cab guy would create a scene over this and with the reputation delhi has how could he be this bhola even if he came from somewhere else or whatever and its happening on a daily basis with him\ni read the post about the zepto guy  but what you did seems quite genuine and honest  23 years back i was in delhi and we had ordered food  the past few years ive lived in societies so i find it very weird if someone climbs stares and comes  this middle age guy climbed 4 floors and came up  i felt so shocked because he could call me and tell me come down your buildings lift is having some issue but he didnt after i took my order i thanked him and asked him if wanted to have water  he said no  so i went and opened my wallet and i had only 3  2000 notes so i gave him one  he was so thankful i told him take the night off and enjoy with your family \ud83d\ude01\nbro ppl like you make me in believing theres always light at the end of tunnel\nthat was touching youre a good person youve restored faith in

spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins

event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many

together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch
