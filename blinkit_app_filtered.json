post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","4":"connect with ppl who are available to meet you within

common these deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products subscribing to unnecessary services or revealing personal data\n\nheres a strategy to protect yourself\n\nuse a lowrange smartphone buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for users in the age range of gen z as theyre frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns stay vigilant and always doublecheck before making purchases or commitments online\n\nhave you experienced dark patterns share your story below","7":"is any delivery app like blinkit or zepto available in jalgaon

my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method","21":"like if im buying a cadbury the app would

rumors take it with a bag of salt\u00a0\n\nwhat is wrong with tata neu\u00a0\n\n tata neu lost 6575  of its users just few months after its launch tata is also losing neu costumers who arent active on the neu app whereas its other businesses are doing well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui bugs are still under progress\u00a0\n\n there have been very little investments made towards customer support call center and they have been repurposing internal tata digital staff\u00a0\n\nwhy wont tata neu survive\u00a0\n\n tata neu marketing team is basically dead their instagram and twitter x posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement\u00a0\n\n blinkit beats bigbasket by a mile tata 1mg users just stick to that app ondc orders are negligible and people just use zomatoswiggy \u00a0\n\n premium users of tata

website where you can compare the prices of multiple emarts like blinkit instamart zepto bigbasket and jiomart\n\nits easy to use visit shopswiftly\naround a month ago i posted my android app and received quite a response\n\nlet me know hows this ui might differ as its old video\n","27":"\nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar ","33":"hi guys\n\ni am launching a new venture to help d2c brands offer 3060 minute deliveries directly from brand website and app  bringing the speed and

items i also tried to look for healthy alternatives like multigrain breads or non veg veg salad options again only one brand is there that too never available online i mean this is so upsetting to see that people here are still not getting rich healthy options available online i wish to see this city growing in terms of healthy living cleanliness more job oriented ","41":"tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber","43":"i ordered groceries from blinkit 2 boys came for delivery \n\nthen one of them says  mam ek request thi i said yes \n\ndelivery boy mam app mein ek glitch hai delivered mark nahi

to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more

nahi sir apke saath picture chaiye company ko deni hoti hai i thought and said yes as zepto etc do usually same but they have inbuilt app feature to do this so its atleast safe but when i saw him opening camera application and photo being saved in his personal mobile i questioned then things started getting unfolded\n\ni opted not to debate with the rider as he was just doing what he was asked to do \nbut its blinkit which still need otp for delivery person to enter on silver gold delivery then why customer photo that too with gold silver coin is required and that too on whatsapp group

my concern here  ive done a diploma in computer engineering but had to drop out from my b tech 2nd year due to some personal reasons i dont have any highpaying jobs since i have any skills that can get me a decent job but with some basic skills im making good enough to pay my bills currently im trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else and the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap\n\nhow i fall into a debt trap\u00a0i tried to be a nice guy in covid times and i helped my brotherlike best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black covid days but i never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life i helped him with all my savings and investments from stokes i was a fool and for the sake of friendship i helped him he never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates this stupidity made me fall into a 15x bigger debt trap than what i had helped him with other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap my dog met with an accident the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didnt give us deposit amount in return broker ran away with our money i met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine got scammed by someone worth of 10000 and still never got it back since the bank is sbi and we know how it works recently my 160 worth of crypto got stolen which i had received for completing tasks and that was literally my last money in hand  such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this\n\nwhats my current status\u00a0i was in total debt of 15 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me i called my father and told him about my situation i couldnt tell him everything because in a conversation over a call he thought that i was too stressed and might harm myself i didnt wanted to give him more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks

since lockdown time but not anymore its now out of my control ive paid huge for my personality of being helpful and kind but now im begging god just take me out of this hell its a very long story but ill try to be short but descriptive im writing this because i just wanted to offload all this from my chest\n\nlittle about me\n\nim a 24yearold boy from ahmedabad my family lives in a different city and i live here with my other roommates who are eventually my far and close cousins only im an unemployed guy with no job skills im currently trying to learn web development but mental stress is not letting me focus on anything else\n\nthere was a time in 2020 when my life was on track and was going as i wanted to but then covid hit covid wasnt the problem at all but i helped my best friend with the money and that kindness of mine started spoiling my life since then so many series of unfortunate events never let me come out of the debt trap i am currently in\n\nhelping my friend saga\n\nit was mid2021 and i used to do swing trading at that time me and my other two friends were running one app that was related to fantasy cricket in starting it was working well we were teenage kids and making very much enough from our small app but after the covid hit that app business got ruined but i had made enough savings from it that i could easily do trade in the market and it was going pretty well as well one day i was supposed to get an amount of 60000 somewhere but for some reason i had to receive it in my best friends bank account  it was fine we were like real brothers and it wasnt the first transaction we had done like that \n\nlong story short he used that amount to pay off his dads debt that his dad had taken from some local person who gave money on interest he just used the whole amount without even informing me at all i knew him for years and i knew there must be a good reason for him to do that and there was after hearing the reason i said its alright dont worry but thats not all after a few days he called me and asked for another 10000 to pay his loan overdue i was like what are you doing man is everything alright and just like that within 2 weeks i gave him 80000 i was a college kid and it was my savings only so i was all okay with that since i did not have much use for that shortly but i never knew what kind of trouble i was inviting for me\n\nstory after the help\n\nthat time it was lockdown so i was at my parents but soon everything opened up and i had to come back to ahmedabad for my college i had almost nothing in my pocket i had to sell out my portfolio for my rent food and deposit amount now my only income source was also closed i had decided that id never ask for money from my parents i wish i could have asked for it by leaving my selfrespect or ego aside instead i called and asked him for a date on which he could return my money if not the full amount then some portion at least he said within a month hed give me half something amount i asked him twice if he was sure of this or not and he said yes hell give me back half the amount in a month so i borrowed my monthly expenses from someone else for a month and of course he didnt pay me on time and i had to embrace that guy from whom i had borrowed money my friend told me hed give the full amount next month but i had no faith in him now still i asked my lender to give me another month and this time he asked for interest i had no other option except to accept this and guess what my friend didnt give me anything next month either at that point for the first time in my life i had to go to instant loan apps and take loans from there to pay off my debt caused by my friend from this the cycle of my debttaking from instant loan apps started i had no other option he kept on giving me dates this blunder became a mess day by day\n\nseries of unfortunate events in august 2023  flat shift and taboo mindset of the society\n\nin august 2023 we had to shift our flat we were now a total of 8 roommates so we found a good bungalow with good affordable rent everything was shorted even we confirmed with the owner if theres any issue related to bachelors living in the society or not and he said theres no issue we vacated the old flat loaded our all stuff in the truck and reached to the bungalow when we reached there the watchman didnt let us go inside the society secretary came and said bachelors are not allowed in our society i talked with the owner he came and talked to the secretary after talking with the secretary he came to us and said ab mana bol rahe hai yeh log jab ki pehle maine inko bata rakha tha i was like are you kidding me what are we supposed to do now i had asked you earlier as well and you said theres no issue and now youre saying this shit where im supposed to go we were officially homeless that day we even found another flat but it was expensive and out of our budget still we finalised it and we started unloading our stuff from the truck we had almost shifted all our stuff to the 7th floor and then some society ladies came and asked us who permitted us to unload the truck were not letting bachelors live here in our building humare ghar mein bhi jawan ladkiyan hai i was frustrated for the whole day and again it started like that i told her that who do you think we are a rapist are crazy or what weve already paid the deposit to the owner and he has no issue then who are you guys having a problem with whos living in the owners flat they didnt listen to anything and called the owner and scolded him as if it was her flat even threaten him if hell let us live here shell call the police and that owner didnt want any other stress so he just refunded our deposited money back and we were homeless for the second time in just one day we had to pay the truck driver 4 times more than the predecided fare because of keeping him with us all day the biggest challenge was where we were going to spend the night and where wed put our stuff because we couldnt keep it in the truck anymore there was a friend of ours who had one empty shop which he was using as a godown even that friend took rent from us so we unloaded our all stuff there and then requested our previous owner to let us spend the night at the older flat which we had vacated thankfully he understood our situation and he agreed that day was the most horrible day of my life had no extra money and something like that happened was crazy\n\nin ahmedabad nobody was ready to give a flat to any bachelor the broker we found that day was really helpful he did everything to get us flat we had a really good bond with him and after staying homeless for another 3 days we finally found another bungalow it was cheap and we desperately wanted a roof over our heads we slightly checked out the property and made the deal but after living for a day there we get to know there are many issues that we couldnt identify before you can only get to know that after spending a day or two we requested the owner to refund us our rent by cutting oneday charges but why would someone do that that heartless person gave us just half the rent amount i had no words for what to tell him he knew all these problems were there but he didnt mention them he was like ive 50 properties main kya yeh sab dekhne baithu he was so rude and he had all our money with him so we couldnt say anything to him\n\non top of that while going to visit one property we met with one small accident it wasnt our fault at all a spoiled kid was driving a new car and made an unexpected left turn without a side light on the new car got big scratches and he was a nephew of gunda od that area had to give another 5000 there\n\nnow i was at a stage where i didnt even have enough money to pay the deposit and rent here weve to pay two times of deposit of rent and one rent in advance theres no way i can get money i had to take loans from instant loan apps online\n\non top of that screen of my laptop got broken while shifting now i cant even learn those skills that i was learning to get a job i had no money to repair that screen\n\nindia pakistan world cup match made us homeless again\n\nwe finally got a flat it wasnt good but thats the only option we had and it was beyond our budget but we had to take it we spent a month there but it was way too far from the roommates office and there was not much development around it people from ahmedabad might know that theres not much available for bachelors near agora mall so after a month we requested the owner that if he could give us our full deposit back we would like to shift usually as per the agreement you cant vacant property within 6 months of shifting and if you do youll lose your deposits but here we had requested the owner that if he could give us our deposit then and then only we can to vacant otherwise no so that was the time of the world cup and the indpak match was happening in ahmedabad there were no hotels available for stay the owners relatives got tickets for the match but they couldnt get any hotel to stay and they were coming from kolkata so what he did was horrible he forcefully made us vacant the flat he didnt want to spend a lakh on a hotel just for 1 day stay so he chose to give us 50 of our deposit and made us homeless again he threatened us in every possible way we couldnt do anything except leave the house trust me these peoples connections are so strong that you cant do anything we didnt even have money to give the fare to the truck driver lucky this time we got a stay at my friends place we spend the whole month there\n\ni had given 15000 to that broker who had helped us to find that flat i urgently needed that and we had become good friends by that time at that time it was extra money i had with me so i gave him that was my so big mistake to help him its been my problem now i trust everyone so early that was a really hard lesson i learned by paying so huge and even paying right now as well\n\ncyber fraud\n\nwhile staying at a friends place i became a victim of cyber fraud i was trying to get one big person from the bank to close all my small loans and have just one small monthly amount at that time my cibil score was too good 800 lets not go deep into it but my last 10000 in my bank got lost in this fraud i immediately filed a complaint with cyber cell but its been a year the case is solved but still have yet to get that 10000 back ive spent 3000 in advocate and other stuff for this case every week i go to police station the for updates and they always say that the bank is not even opening the mail were reminding them every time i visit them\n\nfinding a new flat\n\nit was a diwali month last year it was high time we found a place for us since people at my friends flats had started having issues now with us living there so i contacted that broker whom i had already given 15000 so if he can find us a new flat we can set off that amount with his brokerage but he didnt seem interested in finding us a good flat i kept on calling him to return my money and he kept on giving me dates at this point i was relying on my friend for my food bills still i had no option except to keep on finding a new flat just a few days before diwali we got a good flat but the rent was too high but we had no option i was so frustrated with this now only i knew how i was arranging money to pay my monthly emis taking new loans to pay existing loans it was hell now again to pay the deposit amount and advance rent i had to take loans i was helltired of taking loans for everything there was not one thing happening right with me i had no one to tell all these what they would have thought about me i was already stressed and didnt want more stress by telling anyone this i shifted into this flat and since then weve been living here only\n\nin between one roommate left because of his ego and increased our rent burden even more but lucky we found another one in the next 2 months\n\ntelling my parents about my situation\n\nthe water was above my head in april for the first time i wasnt able to pay my emis anyhow all the emis were overdue almost by 2025 days and i was getting threatening calls from those loan recovery agents every 35 min i get one call i had no option except to make my phone on mute and i couldnt even attend the calls from my parents the mental pressure was so great that i started becoming an irritating person i never wanted to take this situation to my parents but i had no other option except to tell them my parents even had asked me previously is everything okay na and i was like yeah yeah everything is great but then i called my dad that day and started telling him every day with my thriving hands tears in my eyes and the voice of a crying person i couldnt tell him everything since his voice started weakening i was a proud son of him he never said it but i can feel it of course i felt like losing all my selfrespect and all my respect in his eyes as i was speaking to him i must say it was the most horrible moment of my life i cant even imagine what my father must be thinking is his son this much idiot is he really failed as a father and what else i just couldnt tell him all the issues with the exact amount of my debt because it was so huge still the next day he arranged the amount i asked for the next morning i immediately paid all the due amount i foreclosed all my loans and now i had to give money to the people whom i had borrowed there was no hurry in giving them back since they were close once and somewhat they knew what i was going through but god did not agree to give me mental peace i had left with 5000 and i started trading in crypto since i was good at it i turned 50  usdt into 150 usdt i was happy that things had started working in my favour but no it was just an illusion only i was owing around 20000 to him and he urgently asked for it from me i said to him okay ill arrange it by tonight since i already had 15000 in crypto i just needed to arrange another 5000 only but when i opened my trust wallet app to sell those crypto i saw that it wasnt there yes was stolen somebody stole it man my mind got blank there were no emotions in my brain i wanted to scream why god why always me i wanted to cry but i got no tears in my eyes i called my friend and asked to know if it was urgent or what and he said he needed it by tonight anyhow so again i was left with no other option except taking another loan \n\nthis is it guys i just cant type more i dont know how long ive been writing\n\ni dont know where my life is going i wanted to write in a more detailed manner but i just cant the stress im having currently is way beyond anyone can even imagine\n\ni do have an income source that gives me around 15000 a month but with that i can old manage my expenses not emis i badly need one big loan using which i can pay off my all debt and organise my debt so that i can come out of this mess but of course thats impossible to happen now since my cibil is destroyed i had started to work as a blinkit delivery boy but it didnt work either because there were many delivery boys already so the potential of your earnings decreased every time when i make up my mind that ill not lose hope and ill do it this shall too pass that every time something crazy hits my life and ruined everything i want to learn web3 development but the amount of pressure i have is just way beyond my capabilities of handling it i cant focus on anything my family thinks im doing a good job and thinking to buy a flat here crazy right yeah thats my life i have no idea how im gonna come out of this mess but ive selfbelief that ill come out of it for sure i dont know why im been able to manage this much pressure whatever setback i have next month i find myself telling that alright god one more but ill come out of this and when i do there will be no look back ive a dream of owning and running hedge fund in india im really sorry for losing from my track in the end im just writing whatever comes to my mind\n\nis there any saviour who can take me out of this hell i dont know how to beg ive never learned that but people of reddit i dont want to lose in life i want to make parents proud i just wanted to share this and i did im not even sure how many people will even read till the

that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about

of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need

The closest shop is a 15 min walk. Couldn't walk it. I really appreciated having access to a service like Blinkit then.  \n\nThat said, I really hope people are using it only when going out is not feasible. I'm sure people with mobility issues or disabilities appreciate it. My mom and aunts use it to get last minute grocery, a lot of women I know use it for getting emergency menstrual hygiene products etc. People are also foregoing the monthly\/weekly grocery store runs and ordering in bulk on these apps.\nIf the consumers can pay for it, then the service will be provided. \nIt's actually super convenient if you've just moved into the city and have no transport. You wanna buy groceries for a month? You can. You are cooking and forget you don't have an ingredient? You can get it. \n\nIt's just a way to make life easier, ashtey. Necessary?

Zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience. After burning the VC capital. There would be no more discounts. Than, only dmart would be able to provide at MRP or below MRP purely due to it's scale and margins. Quick commerce can never provide below MRP without VC capital.\nOkay. \nA few points. Zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the VC Money to figure out the following \n1) Dark store penetration and expansion. In areas where dark stores aren't profitable ie Minimum order value on a daily basis that's where the VC MONEY handle the loss\n2) the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms. \n3) cost of delivery \n4) Marketing and ads to promote the platform (but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands)\n\nThey DO NOT PAY for the discounts. NOT ONE CENT\n\nThere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category.  But usually they don't. \n\nI have worked in KAM roles in multiple brands. The model is simple. If I have a product A who's MRP is say 100 rs. \nI pay zepto a fix margin. So 30% (norm. It's higher for blinkit). So they pay me only 70rs. So i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nSo take case of discounts. They put it for say 80rs. So instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer. So they balance it 100-80 = 20. They raise a debit note agaisnt it. And the brand has to pay it back.\n\nNot only that. The banners. The placement on top of search for keyword search. Everything is monetized. \n\nSo zeptos net profit is = margin from brands(30%avg) + Banners and marketing placements - cost of dark stores and delivery -tech cost - any marketing (ads and extra coupons)\n\nSo the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter. Blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs (new brands are asked for as high as 55%) and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs. Also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low.\n\nHave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions. But most discounts are borne at the source.\nQuick commerce is made for the growing riches in india, while India will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class, Dmart and Zepto both are not going anywere I think (only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth)\nPeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators. Look where we are now. Food for thought?\nHow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years? Brosky India has infinite cheap labour, it\u2019ll become profitable sooner or later.","33":"[deleted]\nDM me\nHi, which city are you starting with and what products are you targeting?\nPlease tell me\nHey would love to get more information about this","34":"Yes some people do as there could be expensive items or for some orders they are asked to click a picture\n\nIt happened to me twice but they clicked a picture of my hand basically holding that stuff not full picture\nThey are allowed to take the picture of the goods they deliver but you dont need to be included in the photo.\nIt is not normal. Inform this to the blinkit support just in case something is wrong.\nNo blinkt delivery person does not have to click pictures. He'll probably frame the photo and give you tomorrow and ask extra charges\nNope they\u2019re not at all allowed to click your picture","37":"Wah!  Nice strategy. \n\nCut throat competition between the online grocery\/food delivery apps.\nZomato vs Swiggy is in full swing\nFinally, it's about time.

It's a grocery app that, at least in my experience with them, has always delivered fresh fruits, vegetables and chicken\/fish (can't say anything about meat).\n\nThe varieties available maybe a little less when it comes to packaged items but bigbasket comes in handy in this situation. I have personally been able to order a lot of niche items or healthier alternatives thru Bigbasket that I used to consume back in Bangalore and Pune.\n[deleted]\nSwiggy and Zomato is flourishing in Patna \n\nThey should start delivering groceries too\n\nI don't know why instamart and zepto is not here","41":"Atleast add a TLDR because it was TLDR \ud83e\udd72\n>SBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nThis can happen with Flipkart too, and I'd dare say that Flipkart nerf is more likely given it's a loss maker compared to SBI.\n\nAmazon won my loyalty long ago with Prime membership and consistency in reliability of service. They have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues. So the ICICI Amazon Pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping. \n\nHDFC Millennia and Swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and I just got SBI Cashback on top of it, so there's no reason to even look at a Flipkart branded card.\n\nAlso the Supercoin shit seems confusing, I seem to earn them but can't redeem them? The Swiggy Card's reward is much better for Swiggy anyway, so using that for Swiggy is a waste.\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part SBI employees might be watching this\nI would counter your perspective on groceries. Although prices on Flipkart are always less, the variety is minimum. The available options nowhere come near BigBasket or Blinkit. And the obvious that Flipkart doesn't have Quick Commerce, so BB or Blinkit wins there.\n\nMy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours. No Myntra and Nykaa, but almost 4k worth of medicines either from PharmEasy or 1Mg.\n\nFor Amazon ICICI, non-prime members get 3% cb.\n\nThe spending criteria doesn't make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh+ only on one CC for all 12 months.\n\nSo neither Flipkart Axis nor APay ICICI comes close to SBI CB.\nSBI CB and Flipkart Axis both have their own use cases. You like Flipkart Axis over SBI CB because you make substantial purchase on Flipkart.\nFlipkart Axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart. So yes, Flipkart Axis is good enough on Flipkart website but that's about it. SBI CB shines everywhere. If someone's purchase isn't substantial enough on Flipkart then Flipkart Axis is pointless for that person and SBI CB make more sense. Your post looks more like a marketing for Flipkart Ecom than comparing Flipkart Axis with other cards side by side.\nI see this more often for people holding Amazon Pay ICICI credit card, they pretend like it is some really amazing card but it's not. Apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as Flipkart Axis. These both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective Ecom.","43":"They could have tried to charge extra as you asked them to come to a different location or they could ask the app support to pay them extra as they went to another location..\n\nLooks like they were trying to earn extra money...\nI don't live in Delhi but apparently, if you change your location just before a delivery, the delivery guys get some extra cash.\n\nLike maine ek baar blinkit se samaan mnagwaya tha, delivery boy requested me to change my delivery location, \n\nmaine pucha kyu?\n\nHe told me straight up that he will get extra money on this delivery if I do this.

Direction API, distance matrix , geo coding, street view, map sdk, notification services...  Not  to forget aws\/azure services... List can go on..\n\nI serviced a small  uber like cab vendor from Guwahati. There modest google api services alone gets avg of 3-5L monthly.\nYa i understand about everything which you can manage.\n\nQuick commerce is all about timing...how you gonna deal with traffic...i mean flyovers are generally traffic free but then have only few access points...how you gonna make things work out\nIt's been a while since I too thought about quick ecommerce especially in Guwahati,the problem is that when big players like zepto, blinkit or Instamart enters Guwahati, you will cease to exist. Moreover it's not tech only, it's ops heavy. And building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party API costs would be huge and also I think you are familiar with their warehouse models too, so there's another huge expense tbh, so good luck.\n\nComing to tech part, it's not a single guy work (if it's gonna be in a small period of time), u need a proper team (atleast one senior guy and some devs) and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate, so initial funding is therefore needed. Anyways good luck on your journey and feel free to dm, I'm mostly in tech part anyways.\nthere are white-label food delivery apps that you can buy and customise\/rebrand to validate your idea and Product Market Fit.\n\nBut if you want to create a zeto\/blinkit level tech, you need much much more than a tech partner (think multiple engineering teams and loads of $$$)","45":"This message is for others who see the post.

In it's abscene, it's just burning VC money. \n\nUnlike your typical Kirana store, you have a mobile application to maintain (iOS + Android), marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees. Your usual Kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do.\nLike it depends if people in that city prefer convience, & also has high spending power. Than it'll work.\nTier 2-3 cities usually don\u2019t have that kind of spending power. They would go out and buy it. Tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra. \n\nBlinkit and Zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them. At any day I would save 5-10rs if I find a better price in either of the platforms. \n\nTier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit. Unless you don\u2019t have money to burn forget about it\nIt depends on the people...are they aware of such things?\nRecently, I came across the Namm Yatri app and loved their business model. Unlike Ola and Uber, which take a commission on every ride, NammaYatri uses a subscription-based SaaS approach. Drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app, and the rest of the money goes directly to them. It made me think: what if we applied this to grocery delivery? Instead of relying on dark warehouses like Zepto, we could use the existing network of local kirana stores. Consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store. The app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock, and delivery agents (who pay a small subscription fee) would pick up the items and deliver them. Payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth.\n\nBut of course, there are some challenges:\n\t\u2022\tStock availability\n\t\u2022\tStore hours limitations\n\t\u2022\tPrice inconsistency (can be solved with in-app payments)\n\t\u2022\tProduct quality\n\nIt\u2019s a simple idea, but I think it could really work if executed well.","50":"I don't know about the lazypy scam, but the cybercrime police are a joke unless you have a vast network.\n\nThey don't even do anything; they keep cases open for days and then close them, and that's it. \nFrom that point forward, nothing will happen.\nNot only lazypay, this has happened in MobiKwik as well which is enabled with paylater option.

Never borrow money, you will be a slave to debt. Never loan money, you won't see it again. If you loan something, think of it as giving away instead of a temporary measure. So unless you have enough to tide you over for three months, you can forget almsgiving. Keep a small account of your expenses to tally your daily cash flow. Pen and paper, mind you. If you watch the pennies, the dollars will care for themselves, as in our case, rupees.\n\nI want to ask you one thing. Why did you choose to earn money from Crypto? It may be a quick way to wealth, but the risks of scams and rates crashing are worth considering. If you feel that loaning to your friends is important, ask yourself if they have treated you the same way. Consider starting multiple sources of income that are small but steady. Things accumulate over time, so looking for shortcuts may be unwise. Online jobs are risky, and online banking is even worse. If you use UPI or any other applications, consider transferring extra money into a safer bank and keeping some spare cash on hand. Multiple bank accounts with different plans can help protect against theft. Keeping your eggs in the same basket is not safe. When you can maximise your accounts, you will have a better future than most people. Working hard is important, but working smarter saves you from potential dangers.\n\nIf anything, financial literacy is the one thing that can save you from your predicaments. I suggest downloading free ebooks on accounting and money management. A fun read would be \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. There is plenty of information online. After all, debt was the common word of slaves since 3500 BCE.\n\nAs a 20-year-old psychology student, here is some advice for your mental health. While this sounds unprofessional even insignificant, I suggest you write three basic tasks to accomplish in one day.\n\n1. Brush Teeth\n2. Make Bed\n3. Shower\n\nbreakfast, tidy bed, clean table etc. Any doable goal that you can achieve in about 10 minutes. If you complete these three tasks by morning, no matter what other tasks fail, consider that day a success. Mark down your tasks in a small calendar after you have finished them, continuing that for an entire month.  Regardless of the outcome of that month, you can look back on your three goals and be happy. I suggest sticking to three permanent goals to create a habit of discipline.\n\nDiscipline is not an inherent trait, it is often a habit. If you want to create discipline, you have to start small by adjusting the easiest things first. From brushing your teeth, to eating a particular diet, you can bring discipline into your career and daily choices. By insisting on certain behaviours, you can form a value of discipline. Just like drinking coffee is an ingrained value, you create the identity of a coffee drinker. If you want to be someone who runs a hedge fund, you need a particular set of values. It's a good idea to invest in discipline, time management and budgeting as essential values for achieving your goals.\n\nLinkedIn is the best networking system for more advice about your future career options. Networking is a powerful tool and creating connections has better benefits. People there want someone to appreciate their achievements, so you bring them admiration while they offer experience. It's a win-win situation. Why do you think people put so much effort into marrying the right person based on family situations? Because help from powerful in-laws is easier when you're married to the right bunch. The social ties of marriage were like a tool to access different sets of connections. Now the internet solves these issues, so I would hardly suggest finding a wife from a political family.\n\nMake good use of these tools and I am sure you will be flying in no time","135":"There's an app called ground news, it's relatively new and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication, how many times the story has been shared by known \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" media, how each side of the spectrum shows\/headlines the news, and tries to catch misinformation. \nIt's made in the US and our landscape is quite different to theirs so I'm not sure how it fares here, but something like that for India I think would do well with the younger crowd, i personally find it very intriguing. \n\nExecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe it'll help spark something new.\nCan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust , also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the coaching containing video streaming chats question solving etc feature\nHow about an app that compares prizes in real time? Hailing a ride- compare prices from Uber vs Ola. Ordering food? Compare prices from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant. Similarly for grocery delivery. I don\u2019t know if any of these platforms have APIs that you can utilize for this. And that could make this idea a little tricky to implement.\nAn app to pay all bills in one shot every month.\nYou should try Faith tech. Such as astrology applications.

Being a low-income country, folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too in-disciplined to adopt productivity apps (let alone pay subscription fees for them!). Furthermore, if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is - people spend hours in local trains & buses. It is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments (Instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports, betting apps, etc. looking for instant gratification or 'quick' money). Neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps.\n\nTo summarize: Low-income population + Indiscipline + Poor public transportation\/infrastructure --> Instant gratification apps (such as betting, gaming apps).\n[deleted]","137":"","138":">Namaste!\nThanks for submitting to r\/developersIndia.

","5":"How to Protect Yourself from Dark Patterns in Apps (Zepto, Myntra, Blinkit, Zomato, Ola, Uber, Rapido)  Dark patterns in apps are becoming increasingly common. These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns. By using a budget device, you might avoid being flagged as a high-value target.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: This is especially helpful for users in the age range of Gen Z, as they're frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns. Stay vigilant and always double-check before making purchases or commitments online.\n\nHave you experienced dark patterns?

I am in the crypto space since 2017 and I am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain. I am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good off-ramp options available for India without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method. This is going to be a long post and I will share the most convenient method in the end (saving best for the last).\n\nMethod 1: P2P via CDM (Cash Deposit Machine) using a reputed escrow: \n\nI have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues. It is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap, noones, etc and use CDM option. Only give bank's name and account number (don't give other details like IFSC and others to avoid them doing an IMPS transfer)\n\nPros: You get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere. You are safe from fake notes as CDM handles it. Source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money. You are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers. Best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky.\n\nCons: You need to handle the hassle of P2P trade. Money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable.\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Buying gift cards from Bitrefill, SpendCrypto etc:\n\nMost of you may be familiar with this already. SpendCrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than Bitrefill. You can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges, paying utility bills, spending for purchases etc.\n\nPros: Privacy friendly. You can avoid the hassle of a P2P trade and handling the scammers.\n\nCons: Amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards (especially new accounts). Compatibility issues (If you buy card intended for other country, it may not work in your country). The rates you get per USDT is like below 80 rs sometimes. On SpendCrypto it is near 83 rs value per USDT.\n\nMethod 3: Virtual Visa cards loaded with crypto:\n\nThis is the most convenient method by far I have seen. Unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players, Redotpay is a gamechanger. Some of you were asking me to write a post about it (here it is). You can download Redotpay app from App store or Play store and complete your KYC, apply for a virtual visa card for $10 fee (DM me before creating an account and I will tell you how to get it for $4). They also offer a physical card for $100 (you can get it for $70). You can also get a $5 free first time credit. SO basically you are getting the virtual card for free. But note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card.\n\nPros: This card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like Amazon, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit, Zepto, etc (except Paytm). I have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on NameCheap, Hetzner etc. If your device supports NFC, you can add your virtual card to Gpay and pay in NFC supported POS machines. Please use my invite code: 4c3ad if you want to sign-up and it will be a small contribution to me. The physical card can be used to withdraw cash in ATMs. Beware of the charges though.\n\nCons: Nothing much to complain about them. KYC is one (but to get a Visa card it is a obvious). ATM withdrawal fees for physical cards. It also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card (about a month sometimes). You get 82.7 ish value per USDT (still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business)\n\nOther methods: I am currently researching about withdrawing USDC via Moneygram outlets. Will update once I have enough experience.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods. I'm open to discussion. Take care guys! Have fun.\n\nDisclaimer: Guys, please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space. Crypto space is full of scammers. Beware! If you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions, start off with small amounts, first learn and then move to big values. Redotpay is a custodial wallet, only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so. Never blindly believe anyone even if it's me. Do your thorough research. All the best.\n\nEdit 1: Added disclaimer.\n\nEdit 2: Added rates or value per USDT that we get for each method.","21":"Is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto (and the others)? Like if I'm buying a Cadbury, the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps and I would get all the prices  that are there along with minimum order price to get free delivery. This would save effort in using 4 or more different apps to check where I get the best deal.","22":"The gradual (and now noticeable) \"Hindification\" of ad campaigns.

(This data based on internal rumors, Take it with a bag of salt)\u00a0\n\nWhat is wrong with Tata Neu?\u00a0\n\n* Tata Neu lost 65-75 % of its users just few months after its launch. Tata is also losing Neu costumers who aren\u2019t active on the Neu app, whereas its other businesses are doing well individually. \u00a0\n\n* More than 25 to 30% users let their Neu coins expire without claiming them, as most users don\u2019t visit the app frequently.\u00a0\n\n* Most Tata Neu card users are using their credit card for UPI spends and redeeming it for low value items.\u00a0\n\n* Also, Tata Neu card users use the Tata Neu Rupay card with other UPI apps. (Tata has made it mandatory to use Tata neu app to gain 1.5% UPI cashbacks from Aug 1,2024)\u00a0\n\n* The super app doesn\u2019t have UI consistency, the Tata digital team just used their internal Dev team and rushed the app to launch for Tata IPL 2022, most UI bugs are still under progress.\u00a0\n\n* There have been very little investments made towards customer support (Call center) and they have been repurposing internal Tata Digital staff.\u00a0\n\nWhy won\u2019t Tata Neu survive?\u00a0\n\n* Tata neu marketing team is basically dead, their Instagram and Twitter (X) posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement.\u00a0\n\n* Blinkit beats Bigbasket by a mile, Tata 1mg users just stick to that app, ONDC orders are negligible, and people just use Zomato\/Swiggy. \u00a0\n\n* Premium users of Tata Cliq, Vistara and IHCL (Taj) don\u2019t give a shit about the buggy app.\u00a0\n\n* Amazon is still preferred over Chroma (Online delivery) and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app.\u00a0\n\nWill Tata Neu shut down?\u00a0\n\n* Basically Tata, Jio and Adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning. \u00a0\n\n* Now comes the spicy part, Tata has a reputation problem, and it may not shut it down as it's a pathway to all its other profitable business (except BigB).\u00a0\n\n* But through internal team messages and emails it's clear that Tata has no proper plans to make it survive. \u00a0\n\n I know so many users in this community have Tata Neu card, what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down?\n\n\u00a0","26":"Created a website where you can compare prices of different emarts like blinkit, instamart etc. \n\nHi guys, I created a website where you can compare the prices of multiple emarts like blinkit, instamart, zepto, bigbasket and jiomart.\n\nIts easy to use visit [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/shop-swiftly.in).\nAround a month ago I posted my [android app](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) and received quite a response.\n\nLet me know, hows this?

I tried Zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact DMart in the long run. Here are my two cents:\n\n1. **Experience with Zepto**: It was really good and fast, and cheaper due to coupons, but not when compared to DMart's prices.\n\n2. **Will I buy from Zepto again?**  \n   Sure, I will. Who doesn\u2019t want a few quick deals in the name of a discount?\n\n3. **Will I continue investing in DMart or invest more?**  \n   Yes, I will. Until quick commerce burns VC capital, I\u2019ll stay invested. Once the business model is proven to fail, DMart will likely boom.\n\n**How long can VCs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption?**  \nOnly until the IPO, or six months after the IPO due to the lock-in period.\n\n\n**Updates:**\n\nMost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend Blinkit:\n\n**Usability of the application:**\n\n\n**1. Once people become accustomed to an app, they are unlikely to switch, even in the absence of discounts.**\n\nIn my view, this isn\u2019t entirely true, at least in India.\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Recent news highlighted how Jio and Airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes.\n\n\u2022 How many of us stick to just one quick commerce app? Isn\u2019t it common to compare prices between Swiggy and Zomato before ordering food?\n\n\n**2. The elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price:**\n\nAgain, I\u2019m unsure how long this will hold true. The same elite crowd often shops at stores like Zudio and Westside for the in-store experience, rather than relying on online platforms like Myntra or Amazon.\n\n1. Personally, I used to buy meat from an online app for several years. However, after receiving stale meat once, I switched to buying meat directly from shops. These shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options.\n\n\nOne alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of over 315 for Zomato\u2014a tech company with a profit of just \u20b9250+ crores\u2014while being hesitant to invest in DMart, which has a profit exceeding \u20b9650+ crores and a much lower P\/E of 87.\n\nIn my opinion, the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor. However, how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer. Until then, I believe both quick commerce and brick-and-mortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar.

","41":"Why people ditch their Flipkart axis card for SBI CB and other cb cards?\n **TL;DR (though I insist, pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a): The Flipkart Axis card, despite its bad reputation, offers significant benefits for frequent Flipkart  shoppers, including  beyond 5% cashback and additional perks. Its value is particularly evident during major sales events like Big Billion Days. The SBI Cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits. With other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding, maintaining the Flipkart Axis card could be advantageous long-term. Be cautious about closing it, as reapplying later could be challenging.**\n\nI have been on this sub for quite some time, and I have come to realize that the Flipkart Axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members, while the SBI Cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail. It is pretty understandable why this is the case, but I fear that there is a lack of long-term thinking for some.\n\nI don't know about others, but pretty much all of my online purchases are from Amazon and Flipkart (even for groceries, excluding food orders) and rarely from other sites. I\u2019m a male, so most of my online spending is inherently curbed, never requiring me to buy cosmetics, body\/beauty accessories, or frequently shop on Myntra like my female friends. For such purchases, there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales. (Don\u2019t judge me, please; it\u2019s just a light-hearted opinion.)\n\nSo the scope of online spending (in terms of merchants) can be pretty much counted on fingers, at least for me.\n\nI have constantly checked grocery item prices on Amazon, Flipkart, BB, Zepto, Dunzo, Instamart, JioMart, and Blinkit. Hands down, Amazon and Flipkart offer the lowest prices, for most items. Flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through Supercoins and combo offers, unlike Amazon.\n\nNow, here are the benefits of the Flipkart Axis card that I see:\n\n* 5% flat cashback when purchased directly with **no capping**\n* 5% + up to 5% when purchased through GrabDeals\n* 4% cashback in the form of Supercoins (albeit Supercoins aren\u2019t exclusive to the Flipkart Axis card, and dare I say that Flipkart Supercoins are quite useful)\n   * Supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the Flipkart app (up to 10% capped at \u20b920)\n   * Supercoins can be used for Swiggy orders for a maximum value of \u20b915. Considering the average Swiggy order value of \u20b9350, a 4.29% cashback can be obtained\n\nSo, the total cashback can be 5% + up to 5% + 4% = 10% to 14% commonly. Now, the SBI Cashback card handles all the above use cases through Park+, Apay, etc. vouchers, often providing better value than the Flipkart Axis card, in my opinion.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch, especially in the long term?\n\nThe most jaw-dropping sales on Flipkart and Amazon are indeed BBD (Big Billion Days) and GIF (Great Indian Festival), especially for big-ticket purchases, in my opinion. I\u2019ve never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12% credit card cashback on any other sales. (The only sales that come close are the Summer Sale and Prime Sale.) Other individual offers can be very sporadic, and the selling price is not always the best during these times.\n\nAnd every BBD sale is co-sponsored permanently by Axis and ICICI, along with other banks sometimes (like Kotak last year), and the GIF sale by SBI. I\u2019ve seen this trend for the last five years, where they provide dedicated special discounts on the Flipkart Axis card (can't say for future though). So, other credit cards don\u2019t help much during these sales.\n\nCurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon:\n\n* Amazon ICICI Pay: No capping\n* Flipkart Axis: No capping\n* SBI Cashback: Capped at \u20b95000, so maximum order value \u20b91,00,000\n* HDFC Millenia: Capped at \u20b91000, so maximum order value \u20b920,000\n* HDFC Swiggy: Capped at \u20b91500, so maximum order value \u20b930,000\n\nDon\u2019t you think the two HDFC cards giving similar 5% cashback are redundant from HDFC\u2019s perspective? It seems HDFC is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one. How long will they sustain it?\n\nAlso, SBI Cashback is able to fetch extra discounts (beyond 5%) through Park+, MagicPin, Apay only because it has excluded just only one MCC, for Card, Gift, Novelty, and Souvenir Shops (that\u2019s why dedicated gift card apps normally don\u2019t work with SBI Cashback). But how long will SBI tolerate this? SBI will definitely rectify these loopholes, by adding more MCCs\n\nApay cards are tough to get nowadays, unlike in the early days when almost every tom, dick & harry was getting them approved. Though getting it is very basic, it seems - not something entirely impossible for commoners.\n\nNow, these cashback cards (giving 5% cashback on Flipkart\/Amazon) exist only because Flipkart and Amazon have allowed them. The Flipkart Axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on Flipkart. Flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term, in my opinion. Instead, other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the Flipkart Axis card, in my view.\n\nSBI Cashback will likely be nerfed in the future, either by increasing annual fees or reducing the \u20b95000 cap, and the same goes for others.\n\nTo those people who are closing their Flipkart Axis card (even though it\u2019s paid) left and right, what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future? My only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits, is a risky move.\n\nI think if you close the Flipkart Axis credit card, it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future. Axis is very notorious in this regard.\n\nPardon me, if I\u2019ve hurt sentiments. Also, feel free to comment if you disagree with anything (without being rude).\n\nedit. removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nP.S. Don't judge me as some marketing agent of Flipkart or Axis. I'm an ardent member of this sub, always looking for those tips and hacks. Also, I'm not against SBI CB, HDFC swiggy or millenia, I too have SBI CB, it's a beast that I happily use for other purposes. It's just that I haven't closed my FK Axis rn, bearing that \u20b9590 annually \ud83d\ude05, cuz who knows. And Axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past. If you can use and keep it all, better. But, always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robo-thinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber.","43":"Weird experience with a blinkit delivery boy today.

I am a businessperson in Guwahati and been doing business for the last 8yrs. \n\nSo i have been researching on starting a business of quick-commerce. Been to Bengaluru for it and got a first hand experience with BlinkIt and Zepto. I know it will be a tough place to compete but i have a few ideas which will give my business some advantages over them. I have this whole thing planned out and i believe this can be made into a huge business because there is a huge demand for it. I have planned the supple chain, recruitment, the cashflows, delivery and almost all aspects of this business. \n\nThe only thing i am stuck at is the tech part. I need an app. But i have limited knowledge about creating and mostly about maintaining the app. \n\nI dont want to make an app by a third party(which is very easy) - not because i need to pay them, but i want someone who is equally passionate about this and want someone who can concentrate and give enough time to this. \n\n\nSo i hv been looking for someone who is knowledgeable, passionate hardworking and serious about doing this business. \n\nIf you are serious and professional, i m ready to discuss about sharing ownership and do the necessary paperwork. Please feel free to DM if you are interested or have any suggestions. \n\nThank you. \n\nP.s. if you want to stay anonymous, it\u2019s not going to work. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses and insights.

So, I was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting. The price on BigBasket was \u20b989, on Blinkit it was \u20b9105, and Zepto had it for \u20b998. Naturally, I wondered \u2013 if the prices for one item differ this much, what about other groceries? I checked a few more items and, sure enough, almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts, promotions, or delivery fees.\n\nThat got me thinking: why isn\u2019t there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps?\n\nImagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get real-time price comparisons from Zepto, Blinkit, BigBasket, Swiggy Instamart, and others. You\u2019d see all the discounts, delivery fees, and estimated delivery times in one place, allowing you to make informed decisions and save money, just like you do when booking a hotel on Trivago.\n\nI\u2019m planning to build this app and would love feedback, suggestions, or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting. Let\u2019s make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent!  \n\nThe real motive behind this idea is to help people. With rising costs of living, every rupee saved counts. I want to empower people to shop smarter, save time, and make more informed choices. This app isn\u2019t just about convenience \u2013 it\u2019s about making sure everyone has access to the best deals, no matter what they\u2019re buying or where they live.\n\n","48":"Privacy breach by BLINKIT \nI just witnessed customer privacy breach by blinkit as rider told me that they r made to share photos of customers with silver gold coin to whatsapp group of blinkit.

Ridiculous. \n\nI even asked aap apne hath mai khichlo to this rider replied nahi sir apke saath picture chaiye company ko deni hoti hai. I thought and said yes as zepto etc do usually same but they have inbuilt app feature to do this so its atleast safe but when i saw him opening camera application and photo being saved in his personal mobile i questioned then things started getting unfolded.\n\nI opted not to debate with the rider as he was just doing what he was asked to do. \nBut its blinkit which still need otp for delivery person to enter on silver gold delivery then why customer photo that too with gold silver coin is required and that too on whatsapp group which which have other riders and etc people . \n\nPs note: i have tried yo blurred\/put gif on people mobile and faces to protect their privacy.\n\nI dont want that it affect livelihood of riders but company seriously needs to go do ground work. \n\n","49":"Does starting blinkit in tier 3 makes sense ?

( Found this community much more active and understanding, so posting my concern here ) I've done a Diploma in Computer Engineering but had to drop out from my B. Tech 2nd Year due to some personal reasons. I don't have any high-paying jobs since I have any skills that can get me a decent job. But with some basic skills, I'm making good enough to pay my bills. Currently, I'm trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else. And the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap.\n\n**How I fall into a debt trap:**\u00a0I tried to be a nice guy in Covid times and I helped my brother-like best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black Covid days. But I never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life. I helped him with all my savings and investments from Stokes. I was a fool, and for the sake of friendship, I helped him. He never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates. This stupidity made me fall into a 15X bigger debt trap than what I had helped him with. Other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap. My dog met with an accident, the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didn't give us deposit amount in return, Broker ran away with our money, I met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine, got scammed by someone worth of \u20b910,000 and still never got it back since the bank is SBI and we know how it works, recently my $160 worth of Crypto got stolen which I had received for completing tasks, and that was literally my last money in hand. :( Such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this.\n\n**What's my current status:**\u00a0I was in total debt of \u20b915 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me, I called my father and told him about my situation. I couldn't tell him everything because, in a conversation over a call, he thought that I was too stressed and might harm myself. I didn't wanted to give him more stress so I didn't tell him everything. But he still managed me around 5 lakhs and I paid my over dues. Now he thinks everything is clear but it's not. I cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as I was capable of. I worked as a Blinkit delivery partner, I worked for one YouTuber, and so on.\n\nNow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only \u20b990,000 is what I need on urgent basis. The rest amount is from some close people who're never gonna ask for it back but I'll return it asap I save something.\n\n**What's in that \u20b990,000:**\n\n**\u20b916,000:**\u00a0Ring Power Loan ( From Instant Loan App ) Overdue of 15+ Days and they're constantly calling every 5 min and knocking on my door every day. If I don't repay it tonight by 9, they'll reach my parent's house in my hometown and that would be a disaster for my life. My father will never talk to me again and my Girlfriend who has supported me in this bad time, I won't be able to marry without my parent's permission. I don't want to lose the love of my life and neither the respect of my parent's just for a small amount of money.\n\n**\u20b913,000 + \u20b919,000 + \u20b913,000:**\u00a0I had borrowed this from known people but as I promised them to pay last month, I couldn't pay them and now they're constantly calling me and want their money back. I can't keep them ignoring or they might talk to any of my brothers or father about this. Yes, I know I'm late and I'm really capable of paying them this amount instantly and they're not ready to wait for a few days.\n\nThe rest is small fractions of the amounts and that will take a very long paragraph to explain the story.\n\n**How I'll pay back:**\u00a0I've applied for the Rapido captain job. No matter what happens, I'll do my best to make \u20b91500 a day from Rapido. It might sound hard but I've to do it and I'll do it. Along with that I've a small work from one YouTuber that pays me \u20b99000 a month, and a small source of Income is Affiliate Income which can pay my daily bills. So whatever I'll earn from Rapido and other Gigs, I'll keep on paying it every week. Within 3-4 months I'll surely clear this with whoever kind-hearted person hear to help me.\n\nMen can understand the pain and shame of asking for money from your father or someone else when you're all capable of earning. Writing this post makes me feel so guilty but if I had any other option, I wouldn't be writing here, right? I'm all on my own, I'm trying my best but the pressure of paying for everything on time and the stress of other stuff is not letting me focus on my learnings. I don't blame anyone for this situation. I'm the only person who's responsible for this. I'm not really a fraud person. I'm seeking genuine help, please help me out and I won't forget you guys for my life.\n\nEven today when I call my parents, they never fails to ask me that \"Ab toh sab thik hai na?\", Mummy is like \"Kuch ho toh bata dena, aur bada mat kar dena wapis, tere papa befizul ka tension lete rehte hai.\" How I'm supposed to say her that nothing is okay, I'm stuck at the last stage. I've come really far and almost at the door step of a Stress-Free life. All I need is a saviour who can hold my hand and pull me up inside that stress-free world.\n\nIf you've come so far and read the whole post, I appreciate your patience. Thank you so much for giving your valuable time. You can reach me out for more info in my DMs. I would be happy to share everything you want to know. Even I'm ready to give you my ID details as well.","78":"Zepto\u2019s \u201c5-Minute\u201d Delivery: A Satirical Tale of Varna Minutes and Vanishing Riders \nYesterday, I had the honor of discovering Zepto\u2019s unique interpretation of time. You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. They are very clever to ensure that the phones time is not visible when you are on the app but I can assure you both. The screenshots are 15 minutes apart.","79":"blinkit customer service called me to pay for the order again even though i completely paid for it? i ordered something in blinkit for 3k. i got it delivered and paid for it. later after 5min. i get a call saying that the payment receipt is not raised in their systems and i need to pay it again. nen malli pay cheste firstly pay chesina amount one week lo refund istaranta?. even truecaller says that it\u2019s blinkit. i said i paid for the order and app said that it got delivered and payment was done, why do i need to pay more for your internal problem? when i said this, she stopped speaking for 15 sec and cut the call. first thing, the person was speaking in hindi, i asked to communicate in english but she kept on speaking in hindi. asal enti ra idi ","82":"Dosa batter  Where do you get dosa batter in jammu,or any app to deliver at home like blinkit?","83":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter.

Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","84":"Quick Commerce: The Good, the Bad, and the Crowded \ud83d\udef5 So, I\u2019ve been hooked on this whole quick commerce (q-commerce) thing lately\u2014basically, apps like Blinkit, Zepto, or Instamart that deliver stuff faster than it takes me to find my shoes. Forgot milk for your coffee? Bam, it\u2019s at your door. Midnight froyo craving? Done. It\u2019s like glamping for your grocery shopping\u2014convenient but kinda extra.\n\nHere\u2019s the tea:\n\nThe Pros (AKA Awesomesauce Moments)\n\n1. Convenience Supreme: Need it now? You got it. No more last-minute dashes to the store.\n\n\n2. Techie Vibes: The whole \u201cdark store\u201d concept and how it all runs like clockwork is kinda fascinating.\n\n\n3. Staycation Ready: Perfect for days when you\u2019re too lazy to even think about leaving the house.\n\n\n\nThe Cons (AKA Side-Eye Material)\n\n1. Crowded Space: Everyone and their dog seems to be launching a q-commerce app. The competition is wild.\n\n\n2. Labor Drama: The rush to deliver in 10 minutes? Not so fun for the folks on bikes or scooters braving traffic.\n\n\n3. Impulse Traps: Did I need that second round of snacks? Nope, but here we are.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cool and all, but I\u2019m wondering if this is just another hellacious trend in the retail race or something that\u2019s actually here to stay. Plus, with everyone jumping in, it feels like the market is a little overcrowded.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? Is q-commerce your go-to lifesaver, or does it make you wanna photobomb its hype? Let\u2019s hash it out!","87":"Zepto charging delivery fee because all items are not available in a single store I want to order these two things but as they are not available in a single store, Zepto is charging 30 rupees as delivery.\n \nI mean it's not my concern if they aren't available in a single location. It's available in the app so it's on Zepto to deliver the products and show them as a single order. \n\nIf it's Swiggy\/Zomato then it's understandable that I want to order from different places and thus I'll pay the extra delivery fee. But for Zepto\/Blinkit etc it's their headache to make the things available in one single place.\n\nPlease let me know if my opinion is wrong.","88":"Zepto\u2019s \u201c5-Minute\u201d Delivery: A Satirical Tale of Varna Minutes and Vanishing Riders (I\u2019m in Shantigram)  \nYesterday, I had the honor of discovering Zepto\u2019s unique interpretation of time. You see, they promised me a 5-minute delivery\u2014a magical feat that could make even Amazon Prime blush. I placed my order, imagining the rider teleporting to my doorstep with my essentials. Reality? A solid 15-20 Varna minutes later (for the uninitiated, Varna time works like dog years\u2014multiply by three), my order finally arrived.\n\nThinking this was a one-off glitch, I reached out to Zepto\u2019s customer service. Big mistake. Here\u2019s how that went:\n\t1.\tCustomer Service Attempt #1: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to contact the rider.\u201d\nTranslation: We\u2019ve lost the rider. Please send thoughts and prayers.\n\t2.\tCustomer Service Attempt #2: \u201cThe rider went to the wrong location.\u201d\nTranslation: Our GPS works about as well as our delivery times.\n\t3.\tCustomer Service Attempt #3: [Crickets]\nTranslation: We\u2019ve decided to ghost you.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the app\u2019s order history mysteriously stopped loading\u2014everything else worked fine, but not the one feature I needed. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nDetermined to validate my experience, I ran a little experiment today. Same order, same 5-minute promise. Result? A 35-minute wait that could rival the time it takes to get your baggage at the airport. Meanwhile, Blinkit had the audacity to show 11 minutes\u2014and actually deliver within that timeframe. Shocking, I know.\n\nSo, dear Zepto, is this your new business strategy? Lure us in with false promises, frustrate us with disappearing riders, and then leave us questioning our life choices? If so, it\u2019s working brilliantly.\n\nScreenshots enclosed, because sometimes you just need receipts to cope. Both are 15 mins apart but see the time difference on the app. They are very clever to ensure the phone\u2019s time is not displayed while you\u2019re on the app \ud83d\ude42","89":"Zomato CEO Offering JoB to a Bengaluru Manager From a Tweet !!  Recently, the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company Zomato announced an initiative, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, to limit food wastage because of canceled orders.\n\nRight after Zomato\u2019s cofounder Deepinder Goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media, a Bengaluru-based product manager, suggested potential improvements on Twitter for the feature to prevent misuse.\n\nThe man named Bhanu proposed that Zomato\u2019s Food Rescue option should exclude cash-on-delivery orders, and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500-metre radius of their location.\n\nHe opined that customers can misuse the discounts, where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices. Further, the Bengaluru man recommended that Zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer, capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature.\n\nThoroughly impressed, the Zomato boss responded directly to Bhanu\u2019s post, saying that these suggestions, among others, had already been incorporated into the feature. Goyal praised Bhanu\u2019s \u201cgood thinking,\u201d and inquired about Bhanu\u2019s background expressing the desire to work together in the future.\n\n\u201cWho are you and what do you do?\u201d the Zomato cofounder wrote. \u201cWould love to know you more, and see if we can work together.\u201d\n\nBhanu replied that he is a product manager based in Bengaluru, working for a startup. He also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media, particularly tagging Zomato\u2019s sister company, Blinkit. \n\nIncidentally, with Zomato\u2019s new feature, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order. To maintain the quality and freshness of the food, the option will remain open only for a short time. ","90":"I want to change the flutter app icons on the home screen dynamicaly.

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon.

Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, \u201cWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use \u2013 things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.\u201d\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0offering\u00a0an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 \u2014 excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items. (What's considered a \u2018luxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, \u201cHold my beer\u2026\u201d\n___\n**WhatsApp**\u00a0is\u00a0getting a new chat memory feature\u00a0that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service. Sellers do not need to sign up to be eligible to receive the label, which does not have a cost. Alongside the change, eBay Germany is dropping its \u201ceBay Guarantee\u201d and \u201ceBay Plus\u201d logos.\n___\n**Bestbuy Baby**, which has nothing to do with Best Buy the electronics retailer and is actually a baby retailer that had been part of the Bed Bath & Beyond group, is\u00a0closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores\u00a0to relaunch as a strictly online platform. The retailer previously closed and liquidated 115 locations last year when its parent company went bankrupt, but then months later announced a new strategy and the opening of 11 new stores, which will soon be shuttered.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing the sale\u00a0of refurbished electronics from select sellers on its platform, all which are required to meet specific performance standards. For example, sellers must provide reports from an approved 3rd party like PhoneCheck, Blancco, or BlackBelt, who inspect and rate the quality of the refurbished products. Currently only \u201cpremium\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d items can be sold.\n___\nPlus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Klarna** selling most of its portfolio of short-term, interest-free loans to Elliott Advisors, a London-based hedge fund, for \u00a330B.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Ordered a pizza via Zomato for the delivery guy to stole it! \n\nFIRST POST HERE so pardon my writing\u2026\nSo I ordered a pizza from mojo\u2019s and the outlet is 15 mins from my place hardly. In the app it showed a total waiting of 30 mins smthg. I have a tendency of checking my food every min when im on edge. I suppose everybody does.. so after 15 long mins of waiting finally it reaches a point where its out for delivery, after 5 to 7 mins roughly the order showed delivered. I instantly called the delivery person and guess what hes not answering after 2 attempts i called zomato cs and surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate, saying he handed it after conforming my name. we argued for a while and it was going nowhere. At that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs, frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder. She said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open, we can only initiate an refund request. It was 1.30am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a CoD this time and found out there\u2019s No CoD available why??.

A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY.

The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power.

The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline.

How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business.

Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage.

(What's considered a \u2018luxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, \u201cHold my beer\u2026\u201d\n___\n**WhatsApp**\u00a0is\u00a0getting a new chat memory feature\u00a0that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service.

I've been fighting with my problems since lockdown time but not anymore. It's now out of my control. I've paid huge for my personality of being helpful and kind but now I'm begging god just take me out of this hell. It's a very long story but I'll try to be short but descriptive. I'm writing this because I just wanted to offload all this from my chest.\n\n**Little About Me**\n\nI'm a 24-year-old boy from Ahmedabad. My family lives in a different city and I live here with my other roommates who are eventually my far and close cousins only. I'm an unemployed guy with no job skills. I'm currently trying to learn Web Development but mental stress is not letting me focus on anything else.\n\nThere was a time in 2020 when my life was on track and was going as I wanted to. But then covid hit. Covid wasn't the problem at all. But I helped my best friend with the money and that kindness of mine started spoiling my life. Since then so many series of unfortunate events never let me come out of the debt trap I am currently in.\n\n**Helping My Friend Saga**\n\nIt was mid-2021 and I used to do swing trading at that time. Me and my other two friends were running one app that was related to fantasy cricket. In starting it was working well. We were teenage kids and making very much enough from our small app. But after the COVID hit, that app business got ruined. But I had made enough savings from it that I could easily do trade in the market and it was going pretty well as well. One day I was supposed to get an amount of \u20b960,000 somewhere but for some reason, I had to receive it in my best friend's bank account. ( It was fine, we were like real brothers and it wasn't the first transaction we had done like that. )\n\nLong story short, he used that amount to pay off his dad's debt that his dad had taken from some local person who gave money on interest. He just used the whole amount without even informing me at all. I knew him for years and I knew there must be a good reason for him to do that and there was. After hearing the reason, I said, \"It's alright, don't worry\". But that's not all, after a few days he called me and asked for another \u20b910,000 to pay his loan overdue. I was like \"What are you doing man, is everything alright?\" And just like that within 2 weeks I gave him \u20b980,000. I was a college kid and It was my savings only so I was all okay with that since I did not have much use for that shortly. But I never knew what kind of trouble I was inviting for me.\n\n**Story After The Help**\n\nThat time it was lockdown so I was at my parents. But soon everything opened up and I had to come back to Ahmedabad for my college. I had almost nothing in my pocket. I had to sell out my portfolio for my rent, food and deposit amount. Now my only income source was also closed. I had decided that I'd never ask for money from my parents. I wish I could have asked for it by leaving my self-respect or ego aside. Instead, I called and asked him for a date on which he could return my money. If not the full amount, then some portion at least. He said within a month he'd give me half something amount. I asked him twice, if he was sure of this or not. And he said yes, he'll give me back half the amount in a month. So I borrowed my monthly expenses from someone else for a month. And of course, he didn't pay me on time. And I had to embrace that guy from whom I had borrowed money. My friend told me he'd give the full amount next month, but I had no faith in him now. Still, I asked my lender to give me another month and this time he asked for interest. I had no other option except to accept this. And guess what, my friend didn't give me anything next month either. At that point, for the first time in my life, I had to go to Instant Loan apps and take loans from there to pay off my debt caused by my friend. From this, the cycle of my debt-taking from Instant loan apps started. I had no other option. He kept on giving me dates. This blunder became a mess day by day.\n\n**Series Of Unfortunate Events in August 2023 - Flat Shift and Taboo Mindset Of The Society**\n\nIn August 2023 we had to shift our flat. We were now a total of 8 roommates so we found a good bungalow with good affordable rent. Everything was shorted. Even we confirmed with the owner if there's any issue related to bachelors living in the society or not, and he said there's no issue. We vacated the old flat, loaded our all stuff in the truck and reached to the bungalow. When we reached there, the watchman didn't let us go inside. The society secretary came and said bachelors are not allowed in our society. I talked with the owner, he came and talked to the secretary. After talking with the secretary he came to us and said \"Ab mana bol rahe hai yeh log. Jab ki pehle maine inko bata rakha tha.\". I was like are you kidding me? What are we supposed to do now? I had asked you earlier as well and you said there's no issue and now you're saying this shit? Where I'm supposed to go? We were officially homeless that day. We even found another flat but it was expensive and out of our budget, still, we finalised it and we started unloading our stuff from the truck. We had almost shifted all our stuff to the 7th floor and then some society ladies came and asked us who permitted us to unload the truck.? We're not letting bachelors live here in our building. Humare ghar mein bhi jawan ladkiyan hai. I was frustrated for the whole day and again it started like that. I told her that who do you think we are? A rapist? Are crazy or what? We've already paid the deposit to the owner and he has no issue then who are you guys having a problem with who's living in the owner's flat? They didn't listen to anything and called the owner and scolded him as if it was her flat. Even threaten him If he'll let us live here, she'll call the police. And that owner didn't want any other stress so he just refunded our deposited money back and we were homeless for the second time in just one day. We had to pay the truck driver 4 times more than the pre-decided fare because of keeping him with us all day. The biggest challenge was where we were going to spend the night and where we'd put our stuff because we couldn't keep it in the truck anymore. There was a friend of ours who had one empty shop which he was using as a godown. Even that friend took rent from us. So we unloaded our all stuff there and then requested our previous owner to let us spend the night at the older flat which we had vacated. Thankfully he understood our situation and he agreed. That day was the most horrible day of my life. Had no extra money and something like that happened was crazy.\n\nIn Ahmedabad, nobody was ready to give a flat to any bachelor. The broker we found that day was really helpful. He did everything to get us flat. We had a really good bond with him. And after staying homeless for another 3 days, we finally found another bungalow. It was cheap, and we desperately wanted a roof over our heads. We slightly checked out the property and made the deal. But after living for a day there, we get to know there are many issues that we couldn't identify before, you can only get to know that after spending a day or two. We requested the owner to refund us our rent by cutting one-day charges but why would someone do that? That heartless person gave us just half the rent amount. I had no words for what to tell him. He knew all these problems were there but he didn't mention them. He was like I've 50 properties, main kya yeh sab dekhne baithu? He was so rude and he had all our money with him, so we couldn't say anything to him.\n\nOn top of that while going to visit one property we met with one small accident. It wasn't our fault at all. A spoiled kid was driving a new car and made an unexpected left turn without a side light on. The new car got big scratches, and he was a nephew of Gunda od that area. Had to give another \u20b95000 there.\n\nNow I was at a stage where I didn't even have enough money to pay the deposit and rent. Here we've to pay two times of deposit of rent and one rent in advance. There's no way I can get money. I had to take loans from instant loan apps online.\n\nOn top of that screen of my laptop got broken while shifting. Now I can't even learn those skills that I was learning to get a job. I had no money to repair that screen.\n\n**India Pakistan World Cup Match Made Us Homeless Again**\n\nWe finally got a flat, it wasn't good but that's the only option we had. And it was beyond our budget but we had to take it. We spent a month there, but it was way too far from the roommate's office and there was not much development around it. People from Ahmedabad might know that there's not much available for bachelors near Agora Mall. So after a month, we requested the owner that if he could give us our full deposit back, we would like to shift. Usually, as per the agreement, you can't vacant property within 6 months of shifting, and if you do, you'll lose your deposits. But here we had requested the owner that if he could give us our deposit, then and then only we can to vacant, otherwise no. So that was the time of the World Cup and the IND-PAK match was happening in Ahmedabad. There were no hotels available for stay. The owner's relatives got tickets for the match but they couldn't get any hotel to stay. And they were coming from Kolkata. So what he did was horrible. He forcefully made us vacant the flat. He didn't want to spend a lakh on a hotel just for 1 day stay so he chose to give us 50% of our deposit and made us homeless again. He threatened us in every possible way. We couldn't do anything except leave the house. Trust me these people's connections are so strong that you can't do anything. We didn't even have money to give the fare to the truck driver. Lucky this time we got a stay at my friend's place. We spend the whole month there.\n\nI had given \u20b915,000 to that broker who had helped us to find that flat. I urgently needed that and we had become good friends by that time. At that time it was extra money I had with me. So I gave him. That was my so big mistake to help him. It's been my problem now, I trust everyone so early. That was a really hard lesson I learned by paying so huge and even paying right now as well.\n\n**Cyber Fraud**\n\nWhile staying at a friend's place I became a victim of Cyber Fraud. I was trying to get one big person from the bank to close all my small loans and have just one small monthly amount. At that time my CIBIL score was too good (800+). Let's not go deep into it but my last \u20b910,000 in my bank got lost in this fraud. I immediately filed a complaint with Cyber Cell but it's been a year, the case is solved but still have yet to get that \u20b910,000 back. I've spent \u20b93000 in Advocate and other stuff for this case. Every week I go to Police Station the for updates and they always say that the bank is not even opening the mail, we're reminding them every time I visit them.\n\n**Finding A New Flat**\n\nIt was a Diwali month last year. It was high time we found a place for us since people at my friend's flats had started having issues now with us living there. So I contacted that broker whom I had already given \u20b915,000. So if he can find us a new flat, we can set off that amount with his brokerage. But he didn't seem interested in finding us a good flat. I kept on calling him to return my money and he kept on giving me dates. At this point, I was relying on my friend for my food bills. Still, I had no option except to keep on finding a new flat. Just a few days before Diwali we got a good flat but the rent was too high. But we had no option. I was so frustrated with this now. Only I knew how I was arranging money to pay my monthly EMIs. Taking new loans to pay existing loans. It was hell. Now again to pay the deposit amount and advance rent, I had to take loans. I was hell-tired of taking loans for everything. There was not one thing happening right with me. I had no one to tell all these. What they would have thought about me? I was already stressed and didn't want more stress by telling anyone this. I shifted into this flat and since then we've been living here only.\n\nIn between one roommate left because of his ego and increased our rent burden even more. But lucky we found another one in the next 2 months.\n\n**Telling My Parents About My Situation**\n\nThe water was above my head. In April, for the first time, I wasn't able to pay my EMIs anyhow. All the EMIs were overdue almost by 20-25 days and I was getting threatening calls from those loan recovery agents. Every 3-5 min I get one call. I had no option except to make my phone on mute and I couldn't even attend the calls from my parents. The mental pressure was so great that I started becoming an irritating person. I never wanted to take this situation to my parents but I had no other option except to tell them. My parents even had asked me previously \"Is everything okay na?\" And I was like \"Yeah, Yeah, Everything is great.\" But then I called my dad that day and started telling him every day with my thriving hands, tears in my eyes and the voice of a crying person. I couldn't tell him everything since his voice started weakening. I was a proud son of him, he never said it but I can feel it of course. I felt like losing all my self-respect and all my respect in his eyes as I was speaking to him. I must say it was the most horrible moment of my life. I can't even imagine what my father must be thinking. \"Is his son this much idiot?\", \"Is he really failed as a father?\", and what else. I just couldn't tell him all the issues with the exact amount of my debt because it was so huge. Still the next day he arranged the amount I asked for the next morning. I immediately paid all the due amount. I foreclosed all my loans and now I had to give money to the people whom I had borrowed. There was no hurry in giving them back since they were close once and somewhat they knew what I was going through. But god did not agree to give me mental peace. I had left with \u20b95000 and I started trading in crypto since I was good at it. I turned 50 $ USDT into 150+ $USDT. I was happy that things had started working in my favour but no, it was just an illusion only. I was owing around \u20b920,000 to him and he urgently asked for it from me. I said to him okay, I'll arrange it by tonight. Since I already had \u20b915,000 in crypto, I just needed to arrange another \u20b95000 only. But when I opened my Trust Wallet app to sell those crypto, I saw that it wasn't there. Yes was stolen. Somebody stole it, man. My mind got blank, there were no emotions in my brain, I wanted to scream WHY GOD, WHY ALWAYS ME? I wanted to CRY but I got no tears in my eyes. I called my friend and asked to know if it was urgent or what. And he said he needed it by tonight anyhow. So again I was left with no other option except taking another loan. :(\n\nThis is it guys, I just can't type more. I don't know how long I've been writing.\n\nI don't know where my life is going. I wanted to write in a more detailed manner but I just can't, The stress I'm having currently is way beyond anyone can even imagine.\n\nI do have an income source that gives me around \u20b915,000 a month. But with that, I can old manage my expenses, not EMIs. I badly need one big loan using which I can pay off my all debt and organise my debt so that I can come out of this mess. But of course that's impossible to happen now since my CIBIL is destroyed. I had started to work as a BlinkIt Delivery Boy but it didn't work either because there were many delivery boys already so the potential of your earnings decreased. Every time when I make up my mind that I'll not lose hope and I'll do it, this shall too pass. That every time something crazy hits my life and ruined everything. I want to learn Web3 Development but the amount of pressure I have is just way beyond my capabilities of handling it. I can't focus on anything. My family thinks I'm doing a good job and thinking to buy a flat here. Crazy right, yeah, that's my life. I have no idea how I'm gonna come out of this mess but I've self-belief that I'll come out of it for sure. I don't know why I'm been able to manage this much pressure. Whatever setback I have, next month I find myself telling that alright god, one more, but I'll come out of this and when I do, there will be no look back. I've a dream of owning and running hedge fund in India. I'm really sorry for losing from my track in the end. I'm just writing whatever comes to my mind.\n\nIs there any saviour who can take me out of this hell? I don't know how to beg. I've never learned that. But people of Reddit, I don't want to lose in life. I want to make parents proud. I just wanted to share this and I did. I'm not even sure how many people will even read till the end and even don't know whether am I allowed to post something like this on this sub or not.","135":"ideas for new relevant apps for the everyday Indian hi guys, I'm a developer who's looking to work on some app which would be useful to a lot of day to day Indians but cant seem to come up with any fruitful idea so far, since most of the major ideas seem to be quite congested and taken up by major players, such as social media (IG, Facebook, Twitter), ordering food (zomato, swiggy), ride hailing (uber, ola, namma yatri, rapido), groceries delivery (zepto, blinkit, etc)., wanted to know your opinion on what could be ideas for apps which an Indian audience would need in today's time","136":"ideas upon which an app can be built for an indian audience hi guys, I'm a developer who's looking to work on some app which would be useful to a lot of day to day Indians but cant seem to come up with any fruitful idea so far, since most of the major ideas seem to be quite congested and taken up by major players, such as social media (IG, Facebook, Twitter), ordering food (zomato, swiggy), ride hailing (uber, ola, namma yatri, rapido), groceries delivery (zepto, blinkit, etc)., wanted to know your opinion on what could be ideas for apps which an Indian audience would need in today's time","137":"Zomato & blinkit exploiting job seekers (delievery partner) [https:\/\/t.co\/jiy9iJ8KE8](https:\/\/t.co\/jiy9iJ8KE8)  \nAbove is the video url showing how deepinder Goyal, exploiting the job seeker youth of India and building up his wealth.  u\/zomato   via  u\/letsblinkit   is charging 50-250 Rs for onboarding a delivery partner via their app, Then it doesn't onboard them saying there is no vacancy.

Khambhati who spent nearly eight years at Bookmyshow and brings about two decades of experience in events management with companies like Percept, was instrumental in launching major events like Lollapalooza.\n\nKhambati joins other executives in Zomato\u2019s live events business. Last year, Zomato roped in Zeenah Vilcassim, who helped build the NH7 Weekender festival, to head the live events business in 2023. Earlier this year, Zomato also roped in two former executives.\u00a0\n\nThey include former Twitter executive Rahul Ganjoo, who spent six years at Zomato from 2017-2022, the last as head of the new business. The other is Pradyot Ghate, who was at Zomato for a decade till July 2023 in roles across product, tech and growth. The Ken first reported the news of Khambhati joining Zomato.\u00a0\n\nDistrict is yet to launch, but the new app will include Zomato\u2019s restaurant booking and payments services, which currently reside in the flagship app. In addition to dining out, concerts, and event bookings, the app will also feature staycations and holiday rentals. With this launch, Zomato will operate three consumer-facing apps: Blinkit (grocery delivery), Zomato (food delivery), and District (going out).\n\n","141":"Vegetarian indomie ?

CC enthusiasts, **I'd highly appreciate your advice here for helping me decide which card(s) should I own**. Following are my spending patterns and habits :\n\n1. fuel (**Bharat petroleum** preferred, but not mandatory) : 2k a month\n2. **Zomato + Swiggy** : 6-8k \/ month (use both of them almost equally).\n3. Shopping : **Myntra** for clothing & **amazon** for everything else. Amounts I spend here are highly variable each month, but mostly within 2k a month.\n4. Subscriptions & recharges : OTT & cloud storage platforms(Youtube, hotstar, prime video, jiocinema, Google 1, mubi), mobile carrier plans (**Airtel**), and Wifi(a local bangalore based service provider)\n5. Travel : I generally spend around 20-25k per year on **Indigo** for trips to my home. Also spend probably 10-15k per year on 3AC train tickets.\n6. Groceries : No preference here, preferred apps are blinkit or Big basket. Probably spend 3k every month on this.\n7. Health & fitness : Cult fit subscription thst costs me around 15-16k per year\n\nAlso, another quick question :\n\nIs there any specific app suggested for CC bill payments in order to get any additional benefits, if any? There are too many apps for that at this point, e.g :\n\n* I already have iMobile app by ICICI because of the Amazon pay CC.

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","170":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.  ","171":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Feb 26th, 2024 Hi r\/ecommerce \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry pretty closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Each week I post a summary recap of the week's top stories, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in...  \n.\n\n1. **Walmart** surpassed $100B in online sales last year for the first time. Walmart is still not making money from e-commerce, but it's getting close. They've lowered e-commerce losses by more than 40% compared to last year\u2019s level and plans for online sales to become profitable with the help of its ancillary businesses like its advertising and fulfillment services to brands that sell on its marketplace. In the U.S., approximately 30% of Walmart\u2019s Marketplace sellers currently use Walmart Fulfillment Services.  \n.\n2. **Shein** launched its spring and summer collection yesterday via a livestream, working with celebrity influencers to attract attention to its shoppable livestream show \u201cShein Live: Front Row.\u201d This is the second time they've leveraged livestream to launch new collections. Last September, Shein showcased apparel from its fall-winter collection during a shoppable livestream event as well. Shoppers were able to view the three-hour livestream on YouTube, X, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as on Shein's app. Noticeably TikTok was not included on that list of channels, which could be because their livestream software doesn't yet integrate with TikTok, as I've recently learned that TikTok doesn't make it easy for 3rd party streaming platforms to connect.  \n.\n3. **Google** and **Reddit** negotiated a $60M content licensing deal to allow Reddit's data to be used to train their AI models, and they announced it in the weirdest way possible. Google wrote, \u201cReddit plays a unique role on the open internet as a large platform with an incredible breadth of authentic, human conversations and experiences, and we\u2019re excited to partner to make it even easier for people to benefit from that useful information.\u201d LOL \u2014 *human conversations*? Did Gemini write that announcement? As part of the deal, Reddit will integrate Google's Vertex AI to enhance its search capabilities on the platform, and Google now has access to Reddit's Data API, which delivers real-time content from their platform.  \n.\n4. **Amazon** is working on a new e-commerce marketplace to reach Indian shoppers called Bazaar, which it hopes will help the company further compete against Walmart-owned Flipkart, Reliance-owned Ajio, and SoftBank-backed Meesho. Bazaar will only feature unbranded fashion and lifestyle products that are priced below 600 Indian rupees ($7.20 USD), and Amazon will take no referral fee on sales. They will instead solely earn through their advertising and fulfillment services.  \n.\n5. **Wix** is tapping into Shopify's ecosystem for cross-border sales Okay, well technically Wix is partnering up with **Global-e** to help merchants sell internationally. However, Shopify acquired a 6.5% stake in Global-e back in 2021, which it increased to 10.20% in 2022, and most recently to 12.8% \u2014 so that makes it part of Shopify's ecosystem, right? Same as if Wix tapped into Flexport's fulfillment network or Klaviyo's e-mail and SMS services? The partnership will enable Wix merchants to price and sell in more than 100 countries, create customized local welcome messages and checkout flows, adhere to local tax and duty requirements, offer flexible pricing by country, and more.  \n.\n6. After retaking day-to-day control of **Square** last fall, Jack Dorsey is planning to overhaul the 15-year-old app so that it works more cleanly with Block's other products. His goal is to make Cash App one of the top providers of banking services to US households earning up to $150k annually by beefing up financial tools and making the P2P app the go-to banking source for Square sellers. A top priority this year will be tightening the integrations across Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, while eliminating up to five versions of the Square app that previously targeted different user groups and instead creating a single app called Square, with tabs for users to access various services.  \n.\n7. **Spotify** is following in the footsteps of Meta, Snap, YouTube, and TikTok by launching a new program to connect creators with brands. AUX, its new in-house \u201cmusic advisory agency\u201d for brands, will facilitate connections between brands and emerging artists for campaigns benefiting both parties. Coca-Cola is AUX's first client, which will team up with Peggy Gou, a South Korean DJ and songwriter, for a long-term partnership that will include live concerts, events, social media content, a branded playlist, and on-platform promotional support.  \n.\n8. **ShipBob** is now offering Amazon Shipping as a new delivery option for eligible US orders, according to its Winter '24 Release. It will now appear as a shipping option next to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, and ShipBob's other fulfillment partners. Amazon Shipping is the company's shipping service for external deliveries that competes directly with FedEx and UPS. The service launched in 2018, but was paused in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic because Amazon was flooded with its own orders that it could barely keep up with during lockdown. However in August 2023, Amazon relaunched Amazon Shipping in the U.S. for both packages sold on Amazon's website and items from other marketplaces and selling channels.  \n.\n9. **62 million tons of paper and cardboard waste** in the US ends up in landfills, which accounts for around 56% of the 110 million tons manufactured each year, according to a study from the US Department of Energy. The estimated market value of paper and cardboard lost to landfilling in 2019 was $4B.   \n.\n10. **Walmart's PhonePe** launched an India mobile app store called \u201cIndus Appstore\u201d to challenge the dominance of Google's Play Store in the country. Indus Appstore features over 200k apps including Flipkart, Spotify, and Paytm, supports third-party payments and will not levy any listing fees for one year.   \n.\n11. Google stopped allowing users to generate images of humans with its **Gemini AI** tool last week after people complained that it produced pictures of Black founding fathers, a female pope, and gay couples when you asked it to create images of straight couples. Google aims to avoid bias in the output of its AI tools, but attempting to remove stereotypes has caused them to \u201cmiss the mark,\u201d according to Google.   \n.\n12. In other AI news at Google, the company introduced **Gemma**, a family of lightweight open AI models built from the same research and technology used to create Gemini, to compete with Meta's Llama 2 and other open source large language models. While Gemini is a closed AI model that directly competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the lightweight Gemma will be suitable for smaller tasks like simple chatbots or summarizations.   \n.\n13. **Cart.com** began offering its order management software solution as a standalone product. The Constellation Order Management System allows merchants to unify orders and inventory across multiple channels and was previously only available as part of Cart.com's unified commerce and logistics solution, but is now available to merchants on all e-commerce platforms.   \n.\n14. **DoorDash** agreed to pay $375k to settle claims that it broke California's privacy laws by giving away customers' info without their consent and without giving them the opportunity to opt-out. The company also agreed to review its technology and contracts with marketing and analytics vendors to confirm it's sharing or selling information legally.   \n.\n15. **BigCommerce** launched a new video series called B2B Bites, which will offer a curated collection of videos featuring wisdom from B2B industry leaders. The new series will feature expert interviews, how-to guides, trend analysis, and success stories with topics ranging from how to prepare your business for an exit to how to optimize your site for SEO.   \n.\n16. **Zilch**, the UK-based BNPL firm, launched a new credit payment product called \u201cPay Over 3 Months,\u201d which is designed for larger purchases such as buying electronics, car tires, or home repairs. The new offering has already been tested by over 100k customers, and the company plans to roll it out to 3.6M users in April.   \n.\n17. **AfterShip** enabled Apple Wallet Order Tracking, which allows users to receive delivery updates in real time through their Apple Wallets. Customers can activate the new feature by clicking the Track with Apple Wallet button on a merchant's order confirmation page or within e-mail and SMS order confirmations.   \n.\n18. **Walmart** and **Amazon** are facing legal trouble over the points-based attendance systems (which are kinda like Shrute Bucks) they use to track worker absences, which resulted in the firing of multiple employees. In the lawsuit, fired workers accuse the companies of violating their employment rights by terminating them after they took legally protected time for sick, medical, or pregnancy-related leave.   \n.\n19. **Zomato**, the Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, is planning to expand its 10-minute delivery platform, Blinkit, by adding products from various categories, which would put the company in direct competition with Amazon and Flipkart. The company plans to build its supply chain to directly source products and manage stock and is already in talks with individual brand owners to stock up on inventory.   \n.\n20. **Meta** expanded its Instagram Creator Marketplace tool to eight new markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Japan, India, Brazil, and Chinese export brands. The Creator Marketplace initially launched in 2022 as a means to help connect US-based brands with Instagram influencers for in-app partnership opportunities, and now advertisers will gain access to a wider variety of creators who can help expand their target audiences.   \n.\n21. **Google** confirmed a bug with using negative search operators within Google Shopping, which is a way to exclude words from your search results. Google is aware of the issue and working on a fix, but as of now, it's not resolved.   \n.\n22. **Credit card debt in the US** is now at record levels, reaching over $1.13 trillion, and interest rates on those cards have soared. This number does not include the growing debt of BNPL platforms, since these loans are often not reported to credit agencies.   \n.\n23. **Indonesia** issued regulation requiring digital platforms like Meta and Google to pay media outlets that provide them with content, which the country says is part of its efforts to ensure media companies \u201care not eroded\u201d by digital platforms. A committee will be formed to ensure digital platforms fulfill their responsibilities to the media companies. Google said it will review the regulation, and Facebook did not respond to comment.   \n.\n24. **Amazon** is now offering new gifts bags with handles in the US and EU, which are made from 100% recycled material and can be reused for future uses. The new bags still have the dual drawstrings, and you can stuff the handles down inside the bag, since they are attached from the inside, if you prefer the classic gift bag look.   \n.\n25. **Klarna** is launching a digital verification service called \u201cSign in with Klarna\u201d that is designed to speed up consumer login to e-commerce sites and apps in 23 countries including the US. On registration, the customer chooses what data they'd like to share with the store and if they want to join their membership or loyalty programs.   \n.\n26. **Chinese livestreaming agencies** promised rising influencers fame and money, but ended up trapping them in multi-year contracts without giving the influencers the support they promised. Legal disputes are now on the rise as livestreamers attempt to leave their contracts, resulting in the agencies demanding money.   \n.\n27. **The US Department of Commerce** announced the designation of 31 Tech Hubs in regions across the country, as part of the first phase of its new economic development initiative designed to drive regional innovation and job creation. The program invests directly in burgeoning, high-potential US regions and aims to transform them into globally competitive innovation centers.   \n.\n28. **TikTok** is launching a \u201cStar Creator\u201d team to focus on finding and developing influencers who can drive sales to TikTok Shop. According to its job portal, the company is hiring for several new roles in the US and UK including a \u201cstar creator manager\u201d and a team lead focused on Shop creators who are good at selling fashion items.   \n.\n29. **UPS** is cutting sorting shifts in New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, as the delivery company continues to adjust to volume declines. The company did not say exactly how many employees would be let go, but stressed that the layoffs help them deliver \u201cindustry-leading service\u201d and maintain \u201ccompetitive prices.\u201d   \n.\n30. **Overstock.com** is planning to relaunch its store on Shopify in about five weeks, which it shut down last year after acquiring Bed Bath & Beyond's intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction for $20M in favor of operating on its business on BedBathandBeyond.com instead. Marcus Lemonis, executive chairman of the board, said that in hindsight, shutting down their website was a \u201cfatal mistake.\u201d  \n.\n31. Plus 8 e-commerce **seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions** of interest including Carewell, an e-commerce platform for caregiving products, raising $24.7M in a Series B round led by MBF Healthcare.  \n.\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

work culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money

not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they

like blinkit and zepto for their superfast 20minute deliveries but ive noticed a major issue theres no option to return or replace items if something is damaged or missing\n\ni recently had a product arrive incomplete and neither the delivery person nor the apps support was helpful has anyone else experienced this how did you deal with it\n\nit seems like these apps are banking on us paying for

india  my experience hey guys this is my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method most realest post out here\nfinally somebody answered all my questions big ups\n2 days ago i found out about redotpay and my initial thought was eh its too good to be true glad you mentioned redotpay now ill do my thorough research on it\nthese are good for smaller amounts\ngreat read i need to know the withdrawal processes and this post helps in a way","21":"is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on swiggy blinkit zepto and the others like if im buying a cadbury the app would have my location and then they would query it in those apps and i would get all the prices

gradually hindified  the names of government schemes app notifications the list is endless i cant help but think that this is a concerted effort to normalize hindi imperialism and its truly

not associated with tata group and i dont give a shit about tata neu pr ream this data based on internal rumors take it with a bag of salt\u00a0\n\nwhat is wrong with tata neu\u00a0\n\n tata neu lost 6575  of its users just few months after its launch tata is also losing neu costumers who arent active on the neu app whereas its other businesses are doing well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui bugs are still under progress\u00a0\n\n there have been very little investments made towards customer support call center and they have been repurposing internal tata digital staff\u00a0\n\nwhy wont tata neu survive\u00a0\n\n tata neu marketing team is basically dead their instagram and twitter x posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement\u00a0\n\n blinkit beats bigbasket by a mile tata 1mg users just stick to that app ondc orders are negligible and people just use zomatoswiggy \u00a0\n\n premium users of tata cliq vistara and ihcl taj dont give a shit about the buggy app\u00a0\n\n amazon is still preferred over chroma online delivery and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app\u00a0\n\nwill tata neu shut down\u00a0\n\n basically tata jio and adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning \u00a0\n\n now comes the spicy part tata has a reputation problem and it may not shut it down as its a pathway to all its other profitable business except bigb\u00a0\n\n but through internal team messages and emails its clear that tata has no proper plans to make it survive \u00a0\n\n i know so many users in this community have tata neu card what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down\n\n\u00a0 tata neu tries to be everything but nothing is native in app it feels like a browser wrapper with link to individual platforms since its developed by tcs no hate to devs im sure they dont have a ui ux or ab testing team\ndeleted\nnot surprised the uiux of app is total shit \n\npricing of products are mostly higher than amazonflipkartzomatoswiggy which makes neucoins value lesser than 5 \n\ni have this card and i only use it for paying bills only to get 5 neu coins but i could never find any product on neu which is priced similar to fkamazon to spend those coins\nthey should learn something from swiggy zomato etc  where uiux is so much better\u00a0\n\ntata is way behind in its all apps it is like they are still stuck in 2010  the experience is same\n\nbut still use the tata neu app for bigbasket orders for that sweet cashback\n\u00a0\ni am early adopter and had redeemed 24k neucoins since launch\ntata neu

dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later","33":"starting my new venture that helps d2c brands deliver products in 3060 mins like blinkit and zepto in india hi guys\n\ni am launching a new venture to help d2c brands

still no grocery app is delivering in this city yet no blinkit no swiggy insta mart only one that is bigbasket and my experience with them is so bad here as they never deliver fresh items i also tried to look for healthy alternatives like multigrain breads or non veg veg salad options again only one brand is there that too never available online i mean this is so upsetting to see that people here are still not getting rich healthy options available online i wish to see this city growing in terms of healthy living cleanliness more job oriented  uhh just saw a bigbasket now billboard in boring road that promises \u0921\u0932\u0935\u0930\u091c within 10 minutes with your first 10 \u0921\u0932\u0935\u0930\u091c free\nwe should worry about 1 lane roads in patna first\ntry grocery bids from

little less when it comes to packaged items but bigbasket comes in handy in this situation i have personally been able to order a lot of niche items or healthier alternatives thru bigbasket that i used to consume back in bangalore and pune\ndeleted\nswiggy and zomato is flourishing in patna \n\nthey should start delivering groceries too\n\ni dont know why instamart and zepto is not here","41":"why people ditch their flipkart axis card for sbi cb and other cb cards\n tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom","43":"weird experience with a blinkit delivery boy today  i ordered groceries from blinkit 2 boys came for delivery \n\nthen one of them says  mam ek request thi i said yes \n\ndelivery boy mam app mein ek glitch hai delivered mark nahi ho raha aap please apna location change krdo \n\ni show me he did show his phone for a microsecond and was trying his best to hide iti said show me again then i marked it delivered with a rating \n\nthis was so weird i couldnt understand what they were trying to do this was very shady what could they do it i changed my location they could have tried to charge extra as you asked them to come to a different location or they could ask the app support to pay them extra as they went to another location\n\nlooks like they were trying to earn extra money\ni dont live in delhi but apparently if you change your location just before a delivery the delivery guys get some extra cash\n\nlike maine ek baar blinkit se samaan mnagwaya tha delivery boy requested me to change my delivery location \n\nmaine pucha kyu\n\nhe told me straight up that he will get extra money on this delivery if i do this he even told me what area i can change my location to\n\nsome days later i again ordered something from blinkit the same delivery boy came he was so happy and was smiling the whole time and told me that he made 100 on the previous delivery and as soon as he saw my address he rushed to take this delivery he again requested to change the location and i did as he said\n\nnever met that delivery boy again but yeah thats what they do\nonce big basket delivery guy called me said i know you appartment ive been there many time sir is it okay if i mark it delivered do not complaint to big basket ill take other package at the same time it was the same area asswell  i said yes that guy did bought that thing to me first but i had to put my faith in that guy xd\ncontact customer support\nyou should start ordering in

business of quickcommerce been to bengaluru for it and got a first hand experience with blinkit and zepto i know it will be a tough place to compete but i have a few ideas which will give my business some advantages over them i have this whole thing planned out and i believe this can be made into a huge business because there is a huge demand for it i have planned the supple chain recruitment the cashflows delivery and almost all aspects of this business \n\nthe only thing i am stuck at is the tech part i need an app but i have limited knowledge about creating and mostly about maintaining the

give enough time to this \n\n\nso i hv been looking for someone who is knowledgeable passionate hardworking and serious about doing this business \n\nif you are serious and professional i m ready to

pointshow you gonna make things work out\nits been a while since i too thought about quick ecommerce especially in guwahatithe problem is that when big players like zepto blinkit or instamart enters guwahati you will cease to exist moreover its not tech only its ops heavy and building apps for this platform do need some initial good funding as the third party api costs would be huge and also i think you are familiar with their warehouse models too so theres another huge expense tbh so good luck\n\ncoming to tech part its not a single guy work if its gonna be in a small period of time u need a proper team atleast one senior guy and some devs and someone leaving a good pay job to join yours would be umm kinda tough to negotiate so initial funding is therefore needed anyways good luck on

apps  building a solution  so i was trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can do it and using ai could even make it better but its difficult to monetize lots of companies have failed to do such things and pivoted into other ideas\n\nthe puzzle to crack here is monetization the feature in itself can be built easily","48":"privacy breach by blinkit \ni just witnessed customer privacy breach by blinkit as rider told me that they r made to share photos of customers with silver gold coin to whatsapp group of blinkit i documented that in video and he even showed me the whatsapp group with numerous pictures of people with gold n silver coins isnt it is safety issue for person who ordered  ridiculous \n\ni even asked aap apne hath mai khichlo to this rider replied nahi sir apke saath picture chaiye company ko deni hoti hai i thought and said yes as zepto etc do usually same but they have inbuilt app feature to do this so its atleast safe but when i saw him opening camera application and photo being saved in his personal mobile i questioned then things started getting unfolded\n\ni opted not to debate with the rider as he was just doing what he was asked to do \nbut its blinkit which still need otp for delivery person to enter on silver gold delivery then why customer photo that too with gold silver coin is required and that too on whatsapp group which which have other riders and etc people  \n\nps note i have tried yo blurredput gif on people mobile and faces to protect their privacy\n\ni dont want that it affect livelihood of riders but company seriously needs to go do ground work \n\n dont judge me or whatever but bhai sona chandi

dont know if this is considered a startup or not but i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with inapp payments\n\t\tproduct quality\n\nits a simple idea but i think it could really work if executed well","50":"beware of lazypay scam \u203c i just wanted to give a heads up about lazypay scam thats been happening recently heres what happened\n\nwhile i was at work i received a call from an international number i thought it was a friend but the voice clarity was poor so i disconnected the call within minutes three transactions were made through blinkit using lazypay as the payment option\n\ni realized something was wrong and contacted lazypay customer service they told me that an agent would call me back but i havent received any response yet i logged into the blinkit app but there were no orders showing under my account\n\ni approached blinkit customer service again and they advised me to contact cybercrime i reported the incident to the cybercrime helpline 1930 and they took my complaint initiated the process and gave me an acknowledgment number they also asked me to go to the madhapur police station which i did but so far i havent received any further updates\n\ni know i may not get the money back but at the very least i want to know how this scam worked im sharing this so others can be aware and avoid the same situation i dont know about the lazypy scam but the cybercrime police are a joke unless you have a vast network\n\nthey dont even do anything they keep cases open for days and then close them and thats it \nfrom that point forward nothing will happen\nnot only lazypay this has happened in mobikwik as well which is enabled with paylater option they ask for confirmation to enter 1 for yes and then otp for confirmation irrespective of the option you choose otp is asked and theyll call you multiple times until they get the otp from you \n\nthey link it with online apps like blinkit zepto etc and the orders will be placed automatically if you check online with mobikwik scam many linkedin posts will be shown where they lost upto 50k to 1 lakh and they paid that amount to not loose their credit score\n\nbeware when you get these kind of calls\ndid you have lazypay account  what was the duration of the call you received \ndont pay lazypay the amount if it is use now pay later and ask for the clarification\nhow big was the amount","56":"country delight is the worst experience as a customer is there even a

more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks everything is clear but its not i cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as i was capable of i worked as a blinkit delivery partner i worked for one youtuber and so on\n\nnow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only 90000 is what i need on urgent basis the rest

mins of waiting finally it reaches a point where its out for delivery after 5 to 7 mins roughly the order showed delivered i instantly called the delivery person and guess what hes not answering after 2 attempts i called zomato cs and surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly

with my problems since lockdown time but not anymore its now out of my control ive paid huge for my personality of being helpful and kind but now im begging god just take me out of this hell its a very long story but ill try to be short but descriptive im writing this because i just wanted to offload all this from my chest\n\nlittle about me\n\nim a 24yearold boy from ahmedabad my family lives in a different city and i live here with my other roommates who are eventually my far and close cousins only im an unemployed guy with no job skills im currently trying to learn web development but mental stress is not letting me focus on anything else\n\nthere was a time in 2020 when my life was on track and was going as i wanted to but then covid hit covid wasnt the problem at all but i helped my best friend with the money and that kindness of mine started spoiling my life since then so many series of unfortunate events never let me come out of the debt trap i am currently in\n\nhelping my friend saga\n\nit was mid2021 and i used to do swing trading at that time me and my other two friends were running one app that was related to fantasy cricket in starting it was working well we were teenage kids and making very much enough from our small app but after the covid hit that app business got ruined but i had made enough savings from it that i could easily do trade in the market and it was going pretty well as well one day i was supposed to get an amount of 60000 somewhere but for some reason i had to receive it in my best friends bank account  it was fine we were like real brothers and it wasnt the first transaction we had done like that \n\nlong story short he used that amount to pay off his dads debt that his dad had taken from some local person who gave money on interest he just used the whole amount without even informing me at all i knew him for years and i knew there must be a good reason for him to do that and there was after hearing the reason i said its alright dont worry but thats not all after a few days he called me and asked for another 10000 to pay his loan overdue i was like what are you doing man is everything alright and just like that within 2 weeks i gave him 80000 i was a college kid and it was my savings only so i was all okay with that since i did not have much use for that shortly but i never knew what kind of trouble i was inviting for me\n\nstory after the help\n\nthat time it was lockdown so i was at my parents but soon everything opened up and i had to come back to ahmedabad for my college i had almost nothing in my pocket i had to sell out my portfolio for my rent food and deposit amount now my only income source was also closed i had decided that id never ask for money from my parents i wish i could have asked for it by leaving my selfrespect or ego aside instead i called and asked him for a date on which he could return my money if not the full amount then some portion at least he said within a month hed give me half something amount i asked him twice if he was sure of this or not and he said yes hell give me back half the amount in a month so i borrowed my monthly expenses from someone else for a month and of course he didnt pay me on time and i had to embrace that guy from whom i had borrowed money my friend told me hed give the full amount next month but i had no faith in him now still i asked my lender to give me another month and this time he asked for interest i had no other option except to accept this and guess what my friend didnt give me anything next month either at that point for the first time in my life i had to go to instant loan apps and take loans from there to pay off my debt caused by my friend from this the cycle of my debttaking from instant loan apps started i had no other option he kept on giving me dates this blunder became a mess day by day\n\nseries of unfortunate events in august 2023  flat shift and taboo mindset of the society\n\nin august 2023 we had to shift our flat we were now a total of 8 roommates so we found a good bungalow with good affordable rent everything was shorted even we confirmed with the owner if theres any issue related to bachelors living in the society or not and he said theres no issue we vacated the old flat loaded our all stuff in the truck and reached to the bungalow when we reached there the watchman didnt let us go inside the society secretary came and said bachelors are not allowed in our society i talked with the owner he came and talked to the secretary after talking with the secretary he came to us and said ab mana bol rahe hai yeh log jab ki pehle maine inko bata rakha tha i was like are you kidding me what are we supposed to do now i had asked you earlier as well and you said theres no issue and now youre saying this shit where im supposed to go we were officially homeless that day we even found another flat but it was expensive and out of our budget still we finalised it and we started unloading our stuff from the truck we had almost shifted all our stuff to the 7th floor and then some society ladies came and asked us who permitted us to unload the truck were not letting bachelors live here in our building humare ghar mein bhi jawan ladkiyan hai i was frustrated for the whole day and again it started like that i told her that who do you think we are a rapist are crazy or what weve already paid the deposit to the owner and he has no issue then who are you guys having a problem with whos living in the owners flat they didnt listen to anything and called the owner and scolded him as if it was her flat even threaten him if hell let us live here shell call the police and that owner didnt want any other stress so he just refunded our deposited money back and we were homeless for the second time in just one day we had to pay the truck driver 4 times more than the predecided fare because of keeping him with us all day the biggest challenge was where we were going to spend the night and where wed put our stuff because we couldnt keep it in the truck anymore there was a friend of ours who had one empty shop which he was using as a godown even that friend took rent from us so we unloaded our all stuff there and then requested our previous owner to let us spend the night at the older flat which we had vacated thankfully he understood our situation and he agreed that day was the most horrible day of my life had no extra money and something like that happened was crazy\n\nin ahmedabad nobody was ready to give a flat to any bachelor the broker we found that day was really helpful he did everything to get us flat we had a really good bond with him and after staying homeless for another 3 days we finally found another bungalow it was cheap and we desperately wanted a roof over our heads we slightly checked out the property and made the deal but after living for a day there we get to know there are many issues that we couldnt identify before you can only get to know that after spending a day or two we requested the owner to refund us our rent by cutting oneday charges but why would someone do that that heartless person gave us just half the rent amount i had no words for what to tell him he knew all these problems were there but he didnt mention them he was like ive 50 properties main kya yeh sab dekhne baithu he was so rude and he had all our money with him so we couldnt say anything to him\n\non top of that while going to visit one property we met with one small accident it wasnt our fault at all a spoiled kid was driving a new car and made an unexpected left turn without a side light on the new car got big scratches and he was a nephew of gunda od that area had to give another 5000 there\n\nnow i was at a stage where i didnt even have enough money to pay the deposit and rent here weve to pay two times of deposit of rent and one rent in advance theres no way i can get money i had to take loans from instant loan apps online\n\non top of that screen of my laptop got broken while shifting now i cant even learn those skills that i was learning to get a job i had no money to repair that screen\n\nindia pakistan world cup match made us homeless again\n\nwe finally got a flat it wasnt good but thats the only option we had and it was beyond our budget but we had to take it we spent a month there but it was way too far from the roommates office and there was not much development around it people from ahmedabad might know that theres not much available for bachelors near agora mall so after a month we requested the owner that if he could give us our full deposit back we would like to shift usually as per the agreement you cant vacant property within 6 months of shifting and if you do youll lose your deposits but here we had requested the owner that if he could give us our deposit then and then only we can to vacant otherwise no so that was the time of the world cup and the indpak match was happening in ahmedabad there were no hotels available for stay the owners relatives got tickets for the match but they couldnt get any hotel to stay and they were coming from kolkata so what he did was horrible he forcefully made us vacant the flat he didnt want to spend a lakh on a hotel just for 1 day stay so he chose to give us 50 of our deposit and made us homeless again he threatened us in every possible way we couldnt do anything except leave the house trust me these peoples connections are so strong that you cant do anything we didnt even have money to give the fare to the truck driver lucky this time we got a stay at my friends place we spend the whole month there\n\ni had given 15000 to that broker who had helped us to find that flat i urgently needed that and we had become good friends by that time at that time it was extra money i had with me so i gave him that was my so big mistake to help him its been my problem now i trust everyone so early that was a really hard lesson i learned by paying so huge and even paying right now as well\n\ncyber fraud\n\nwhile staying at a friends place i became a victim of cyber fraud i was trying to get one big person from the bank to close all my small loans and have just one small monthly amount at that time my cibil score was too good 800 lets not go deep into it but my last 10000 in my bank got lost in this fraud i immediately filed a complaint with cyber cell but its been a year the case is solved but still have yet to get that 10000 back ive spent 3000 in advocate and other stuff for this case every week i go to police station the for updates and they always say that the bank is not even opening the mail were reminding them every time i visit them\n\nfinding a new flat\n\nit was a diwali month last year it was high time we found a place for us since people at my friends flats had started having issues now with us living there so i contacted that broker whom i had already given 15000 so if he can find us a new flat we can set off that amount with his brokerage but he didnt seem interested in finding us a good flat i kept on calling him to return my money and he kept on giving me dates at this point i was relying on my friend for my food bills still i had no option except to keep on finding a new flat just a few days before diwali we got a good flat but the rent was too high but we had no option i was so frustrated with this now only i knew how i was arranging money to pay my monthly emis taking new loans to pay existing loans it was hell now again to pay the deposit amount and advance rent i had to take loans i was helltired of taking loans for everything there was not one thing happening right with me i had no one to tell all these what they would have thought about me i was already stressed and didnt want more stress by telling anyone this i shifted into this flat and since then weve been living here only\n\nin between one roommate left because of his ego and increased our rent burden even more but lucky we found another one in the next 2 months\n\ntelling my parents about my situation\n\nthe water was above my head in april for the first time i wasnt able to pay my emis anyhow all the emis were overdue almost by 2025 days and i was getting threatening calls from those loan recovery agents every 35 min i get one call i had no option except to make my phone on mute and i couldnt even attend the calls from my parents the mental pressure was so great that i started becoming an irritating person i never wanted to take this situation to my parents but i had no other option except to tell them my parents even had asked me previously is everything okay na and i was like yeah yeah everything is great but then i called my dad that day and started telling him every day with my thriving hands tears in my eyes and the voice of a crying person i couldnt tell him everything since his voice started weakening i was a proud son of him he never said it but i can feel it of course i felt like losing all my selfrespect and all my respect in his eyes as i was speaking to him i must say it was the most horrible moment of my life i cant even imagine what my father must be thinking is his son this much idiot is he really failed as a father and what else i just couldnt tell him all the issues with the exact amount of my debt because it was so huge still the next day he arranged the amount i asked for the next morning i immediately paid all the due amount i foreclosed all my loans and now i had to give money to the people whom i had borrowed there was no hurry in giving them back since they were close once and somewhat they knew what i was going through but god did not agree to give me mental peace i had left with 5000 and i started trading in crypto since i was good at it i turned 50  usdt into 150 usdt i was happy that things had started working in my favour but no it was just an illusion only i was owing around 20000 to him and he urgently asked for it from me i said to him okay ill arrange it by tonight since i already had 15000 in crypto i just needed to arrange another 5000 only but when i opened my trust wallet app to sell those crypto i saw that it wasnt there yes was stolen somebody stole it man my mind got blank there were no emotions in my brain i wanted to scream why god why always me i wanted to cry but i got no tears in my eyes i called my friend and asked to know if it was urgent or what and he said he needed it by tonight anyhow so again i was left with no other option except taking another loan \n\nthis is it guys i just cant type more i dont know how long ive been writing\n\ni dont know where my life is going i wanted to write in a more detailed manner but i just cant the stress im having currently is way beyond anyone can even imagine\n\ni do have an income source that gives me around 15000 a month but with that i can old manage my expenses not emis i badly need one big loan using which i can pay off my all debt and organise my debt so that i can come out of this mess but of course thats impossible to happen now since my cibil is destroyed i had started to work as a blinkit delivery boy but it didnt work either because there were many delivery boys already so the potential of your earnings decreased every time when i make up my mind that ill not lose hope and ill do it this shall too pass that every time something crazy hits my life and ruined everything i want to learn web3 development but the amount of pressure i have is just way beyond my capabilities of handling it i cant focus on anything my family thinks im doing a good job and thinking to buy a flat here crazy right yeah thats my life i have no idea how im gonna come out of this mess but ive selfbelief that ill come out of it for sure i dont know why im been able to manage this much pressure whatever setback i have next month i find myself telling that alright god one more but ill come out of this and when i do there will be no look back ive a dream of owning and running hedge fund in india im really sorry for losing from my track in the end im just writing whatever comes to my mind\n\nis there any saviour who can take me out of this hell i dont know how to beg ive never learned that but people of reddit i dont want to lose in life i want to make parents proud i just wanted to share this and i did im not even sure how many people will even read till the end and even dont know whether am i allowed to post something like this on this sub or not if its in my hand to help you  i will surely try to help you but i am broke too  i am sorry brother\ni had a boyfriend once tell me something his father did never borrow money you will be a slave to debt never loan money you wont see it again if you loan something think of it as giving away instead of a temporary measure so unless you have enough to tide you over for three months you can forget almsgiving keep a small account of your expenses to tally your daily cash flow pen and paper mind you if you watch the pennies the dollars will care for themselves as in our case rupees\n\ni want to ask you one thing why did you choose to earn money from crypto it may be a quick way to wealth but the risks of scams and rates crashing are worth considering if you feel that loaning to your friends is important ask yourself if they have treated you the same way consider starting multiple sources of income that are small but steady things accumulate over time so looking for shortcuts may be unwise online jobs are risky and online banking is even worse if you use upi or any other applications consider transferring extra money into a safer bank and keeping some spare cash on hand multiple bank accounts with different plans can help protect against theft keeping your eggs in the same basket is not safe when you can maximise your accounts you will have a better future than most people working hard is important but working smarter saves you from potential dangers\n\nif anything financial literacy is the one thing that can save you from your predicaments i suggest downloading free ebooks on accounting and money management a fun read would be rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki and sharon lechter there is plenty of information online after all debt was the common word of slaves since 3500 bce\n\nas a 20yearold psychology student here is some advice for your mental health while this sounds unprofessional even insignificant i suggest you write three basic tasks to accomplish in one day\n\n1 brush teeth\n2 make bed\n3 shower\n\nbreakfast tidy bed clean table etc any doable goal that you can achieve in about 10 minutes if you complete these three tasks by morning no matter what other tasks fail consider that day a success mark down your tasks in a small calendar after you have finished them continuing that for an entire month  regardless of the outcome of that month you can look back on your three goals and be happy i suggest sticking to three permanent goals to create a habit of discipline\n\ndiscipline is not an inherent trait it is often a habit if you want to create discipline you have to start small by adjusting the easiest things first from brushing your teeth to eating a particular diet you can bring discipline into your career and daily choices by insisting on certain behaviours you can form a value of discipline just like drinking coffee is an ingrained value you create the identity of a coffee drinker if you want to be someone who runs a hedge fund you need a particular set of values its a good idea to invest in discipline time management and budgeting as essential values for achieving your goals\n\nlinkedin is the best networking system for more advice about your future career options networking is a powerful tool and creating connections has better benefits people there want someone to appreciate their achievements so you bring them admiration while they offer experience its a winwin situation why do you think people put so much effort into marrying the right person based on family situations because help from powerful inlaws is easier when youre married to the right bunch the social ties of marriage were like a tool to access different sets of connections now the internet solves these issues so i would hardly suggest finding a wife from a political family\n\nmake good use of these tools and i am sure you will be flying in no time","135":"ideas for new relevant apps for the everyday indian hi guys im a developer whos looking to work on some app which would be useful to a lot of

would need in todays time theres an app called ground news its relatively new and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication how many times the story has been shared by known conservative or liberal media how each side of the spectrum showsheadlines the news and tries to catch misinformation \nits made in the us and our landscape is quite different to theirs so im not sure how it fares here but something like that for india i think would do well with the younger crowd i personally find it very intriguing \n\nexecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe itll help spark something new\ncan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust  also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the

from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant similarly for grocery delivery i dont know if any of these platforms have apis that you can utilize for this and that could make this

betting apps being a lowincome country folks in our country simply do not have the wallet size to consider discretionary spend and on top of it are too indisciplined to adopt productivity apps let alone pay subscription fees for them furthermore if you consider how inefficient our public transportation is  people spend hours in local trains  buses it is unlikely that they are going to use an app to study or acquire skills while traveling for hours in these claustrophobic environments instead they use this travel time on fantasy sports betting apps etc looking for instant gratification or quick money neither is our public infrastructure any great to provide access to libraries for the public to use their time on productive apps\n\nto summarize lowincome population  indiscipline  poor

paul and i follow the ecommerce industry pretty closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter each week i post a summary recap of the weeks top stories which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in  \n\n\n1 walmart surpassed 100b in online sales last year for the first time walmart is still not making money from ecommerce but its getting close theyve lowered ecommerce losses by more than 40 compared to last years level and plans for online sales to become profitable with the help of its ancillary businesses like its advertising and fulfillment services to brands that sell on its marketplace in the us approximately 30 of walmarts marketplace sellers currently use walmart fulfillment services  \n\n2 shein launched its spring and summer collection yesterday via a livestream working with celebrity influencers to attract attention to its shoppable livestream show shein live front row this is the second time theyve leveraged livestream to launch new collections last september shein showcased apparel from its fallwinter collection during a shoppable livestream event as well shoppers were able to view the threehour livestream on youtube x instagram and facebook as well as on sheins app noticeably tiktok was not included on that list of channels which could be because their livestream software doesnt yet integrate with tiktok as ive recently learned that tiktok doesnt make it easy for 3rd party streaming platforms to connect  \n\n3 google and reddit negotiated a 60m content licensing deal to allow reddits data to be used to train their ai models and they announced it in the weirdest way possible google wrote reddit plays a unique role on the open internet as a large platform with an incredible breadth of authentic human conversations and experiences and were excited to partner to make it even easier for people to benefit from that useful information lol  human conversations did gemini write that announcement as part of the deal reddit will integrate googles vertex ai to enhance its search capabilities on the platform and google now has access to reddits data api which delivers realtime content from their platform  \n\n4 amazon is working on a new ecommerce marketplace to reach indian shoppers called bazaar which it hopes will help the company further compete against walmartowned flipkart relianceowned ajio and softbankbacked

are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and

should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for

protect yourself from dark patterns in apps zepto myntra blinkit zomato ola uber rapido  dark patterns in apps are becoming increasingly common these deceptive practices manipulate users into making

specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for

this is my first post here although i have interacted with a lot of you in comments i am in the crypto space since 2017 and i am passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain i am writing this post to share my knowledge and experience with some good offramp options available for india without bank freeze issues along with pros and cons of each method this is going to be a long post and i will share the most convenient method in the end saving best for the last\n\nmethod 1 p2p via cdm cash deposit machine using a reputed escrow \n\ni have used this method for almost a year now and found no bank freeze issues it is better to use escrow platforms like localcoinswap noones etc and use cdm option only give banks name and account number dont give other details like ifsc and others to avoid them doing an imps transfer\n\npros you get cash in your bank account that you can spend anywhere you are safe from fake notes as cdm handles it source of cash cannot be classified as dirty money or clean money and nobody can freeze your account for receiving dirty money you are safe from any attacks from goons posed as buyers best rates like 89 to 95 but very risky\n\ncons you need to handle the hassle of p2p trade money that lands on your bank account becomes accountable\n\n\n\nmethod 2 buying gift cards from bitrefill spendcrypto etc\n\nmost of you may be familiar with this already spendcrypto is far cheaper and provides best rates than bitrefill you can use amazon pay cards for mobile phone recharges paying utility bills spending for purchases etc\n\npros privacy friendly you can avoid the hassle of a p2p trade and handling the scammers\n\ncons amazon flags and suspends accounts if we use only gift cards especially new accounts compatibility issues if you buy card intended for other country it may not work in your country the rates you get per usdt is like below 80 rs sometimes on spendcrypto it is near 83 rs value per usdt\n\nmethod 3 virtual visa cards loaded with crypto\n\nthis is the most convenient method by far i have seen unlike myprepaidcenter and other old players redotpay is a gamechanger some of you were asking me to write a post about it here it is you can download redotpay app from app store or play store and complete your kyc apply for a virtual visa card for 10 fee dm me before creating an account and i will tell you how to get it for 4 they also offer a physical card for 100 you can get it for 70 you can also get a 5 free first time credit so basically you are getting the virtual card for free but note that you cannot use this one time free credit for applying the card\n\npros this card is powered by visa and is supported in many merchants like amazon uber swiggy zomato blinkit zepto etc except paytm i have bought from these platforms and even international purchases on namecheap hetzner etc if your device supports nfc you can add your virtual card to gpay and pay in nfc supported pos machines please use my invite code 4c3ad if you want to signup and it will be a small contribution to me the physical card can be used to withdraw cash in atms beware of the charges though\n\ncons nothing much to complain about them kyc is one but to get a visa card it is a obvious atm withdrawal fees for physical cards it also takes a lot of time for them to deliver the physical card about a month sometimes you get 827 ish value per usdt still good for people earning in crypto and for people withdrawing trading profits but not suitable for people doing p2p as business\n\nother methods i am currently researching about withdrawing usdc via moneygram outlets will update once i have enough experience\n\nplease feel free to ask any questions you may have or any criticism about the above methods im open to discussion take care guys have fun\n\ndisclaimer guys please do your own research before making decisions in crypto space crypto space is full of scammers beware if you are a beginner and want to do high value transactions start off with small amounts first learn and then move to big values redotpay is a custodial wallet only put money that you are going to spend in a week or so never blindly believe anyone even if its me do your thorough research all the best\n\nedit 1 added disclaimer\n\nedit 2 added rates or value per usdt that we get for each method most realest post out here\nfinally somebody answered all my questions big ups\n2 days ago i found out about redotpay and my initial thought was eh its too good to be true glad you mentioned redotpay now ill do my thorough research on it\nthese are good for smaller amounts\ngreat read i need to know the withdrawal processes and this post helps in a way"}]],"21":[[{"negative":0.0128057962,"neutral":0.9245421886,"positive":0.0626520291,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"is there any app or web service which gets  you the total cost for all products on

to make it clear that i am not associated with tata group and i dont give a shit about tata neu pr ream this data based on internal rumors take it with a bag of salt\u00a0\n\nwhat is wrong with tata neu\u00a0\n\n tata neu lost 6575  of its users just few months after its launch tata is also losing neu costumers who arent active on the neu app whereas its other businesses are doing well individually \u00a0\n\n more than 25 to 30 users let their neu coins expire without claiming them as most users dont visit the app frequently\u00a0\n\n most tata neu card users are using their credit card for upi spends and redeeming it for low value items\u00a0\n\n also tata neu card users use the tata neu rupay card with other upi apps tata has made it mandatory to use tata neu app to gain 15 upi cashbacks from aug 12024\u00a0\n\n the super app doesnt have ui consistency the tata digital team just used their internal dev team and rushed the app to launch for tata ipl 2022 most ui bugs are still under progress\u00a0\n\n there have been very little investments made towards customer support call center and they have been repurposing internal tata digital staff\u00a0\n\nwhy wont tata neu survive\u00a0\n\n tata neu marketing team is basically dead their instagram and twitter x posts receive single digit likes and almost negligible engagement\u00a0\n\n blinkit beats bigbasket by a mile tata 1mg users just stick to that app ondc orders are negligible and people just use zomatoswiggy \u00a0\n\n premium users of tata cliq vistara and ihcl taj dont give a shit about the buggy app\u00a0\n\n amazon is still preferred over chroma online delivery and nobody is bothered about getting some insurance from a super app\u00a0\n\nwill tata neu shut down\u00a0\n\n basically tata jio and adani launched super apps to gain the maximum market share and currently no one is winning \u00a0\n\n now comes the spicy part tata has a reputation problem and it may not shut it down as its a pathway to all its other profitable business except bigb\u00a0\n\n but through internal team messages and emails its clear that tata has no proper plans to make it survive \u00a0\n\n i know so many users in this community have tata neu card what do you guys have to say if the app shuts down\n\n\u00a0 tata neu tries to be everything but nothing is native in app it feels like a browser wrapper with link to individual platforms since its developed by tcs no hate to devs im sure they dont have a ui ux or ab testing team\ndeleted\nnot surprised the uiux of app is total shit \n\npricing of products are mostly higher than amazonflipkartzomatoswiggy which makes neucoins value lesser than 5 \n\ni have this card and i only use it for paying bills only to get 5 neu coins but i could never find any product on neu which is priced similar to fkamazon to spend those coins\nthey should learn something from swiggy zomato etc  where uiux is so much better\u00a0\n\ntata is way behind in its all apps it is like they are still stuck in 2010  the experience is same\n\nbut still use the tata neu app for bigbasket orders for that sweet cashback\n\u00a0\ni am early adopter and had redeemed 24k neucoins since launch\ntata neu coins expiry date always get extended after every coins addition to the cumulative balance \n\ncollected 4k worth of coins\n\n\ncroma also comes with good offer people are just not aware of it\n\neven nothing   cmf phones are sold through croma at same price with bank

been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite

cb and other cb cards\n tldr though i insist pls read the whole \ud83d\ude0a the flipkart axis card despite its bad reputation offers significant benefits for frequent flipkart  shoppers including  beyond 5 cashback and additional perks its value is particularly evident during major sales events like big billion days the sbi cashback card is also valuable but may face restrictions and potential future reductions in benefits with other cashback cards potentially becoming less rewarding maintaining the flipkart axis card could be advantageous longterm be cautious about closing it as reapplying later could be challenging\n\ni have been on this sub for quite some time and i have come to realize that the flipkart axis card has a bad and useless reputation among members while the sbi cashback card seems to be considered the holy grail it is pretty understandable why this is the case but i fear that there is a lack of longterm thinking for some\n\ni dont know about others but pretty much all of my online purchases are from amazon and flipkart even for groceries excluding food orders and rarely from other sites im a male so most of my online spending is inherently curbed never requiring me to buy cosmetics bodybeauty accessories or frequently shop on myntra like my female friends for such purchases there are dedicated websites offering better deals during clearance sales dont judge me please its just a lighthearted opinion\n\nso the scope of online spending in terms of merchants can be pretty much counted on fingers at least for me\n\ni have constantly checked grocery item prices on amazon flipkart bb zepto dunzo instamart jiomart and blinkit hands down amazon and flipkart offer the lowest prices for most items flipkart sweetens the deal even more with additional discounts through supercoins and combo offers unlike amazon\n\nnow here are the benefits of the flipkart axis card that i see\n\n 5 flat cashback when purchased directly with no capping\n 5  up to 5 when purchased through grabdeals\n 4 cashback in the form of supercoins albeit supercoins arent exclusive to the flipkart axis card and dare i say that flipkart supercoins are quite useful\n    supercoins can be used for recharges and bill payments through the flipkart app up to 10 capped at 20\n    supercoins can be used for swiggy orders for a maximum value of 15 considering the average swiggy order value of 350 a 429 cashback can be obtained\n\nso the total cashback can be 5  up to 5  4  10 to 14 commonly now the sbi cashback card handles all the above use cases through park apay etc vouchers often providing better value than the flipkart axis card in my opinion\n\nso whats the catch especially in the long term\n\nthe most jawdropping sales on flipkart and amazon are indeed bbd big billion days and gif great indian festival especially for bigticket purchases in my opinion ive never seen instant discounts on already heavily lowered prices with 10 to 12 credit card cashback on any other sales the only sales that come close are the summer sale and prime sale other individual offers can be very sporadic and the selling price is not always the best during these times\n\nand every bbd sale is cosponsored permanently by axis and icici along with other banks sometimes like kotak last year and the gif sale by sbi ive seen this trend for the last five years where they provide dedicated special discounts on the flipkart axis card cant say for future though so other credit cards dont help much during these sales\n\ncurrent cashback cards that provide cashback on flipkartamazon\n\n amazon icici pay no capping\n flipkart axis no capping\n sbi cashback capped at 5000 so maximum order value 100000\n hdfc millenia capped at 1000 so maximum order value 20000\n hdfc swiggy capped at 1500 so maximum order value 30000\n\ndont you think the two hdfc cards giving similar 5 cashback are redundant from hdfcs perspective it seems hdfc is bleeding money from both cards rather than just one how long will they sustain it\n\nalso sbi cashback is able to fetch extra discounts beyond 5 through park magicpin apay only because it has excluded just only one mcc for card gift novelty and souvenir shops thats why dedicated gift card apps normally dont work with sbi cashback but how long will sbi tolerate this sbi will definitely rectify these loopholes by adding more mccs\n\napay cards are tough to get nowadays unlike in the early days when almost every tom dick  harry was getting them approved though getting it is very basic it seems  not something entirely impossible for commoners\n\nnow these cashback cards giving 5 cashback on flipkartamazon exist only because flipkart and amazon have allowed them the flipkart axis card is a dedicated card for purchases on flipkart flipkart will likely never eliminate the features of this card for others in the long term in my opinion instead other cashback cards may be nerfed in the future to accommodate the flipkart axis card in my view\n\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nto those people who are closing their flipkart axis card even though its paid left and right what is your backup plan when other cashback cards may not remain as lucrative in the future my only point is that cancelling a core dedicated cc of flipkart for another non core cc that happens to provide the same benefits is a risky move\n\ni think if you close the flipkart axis credit card it will be very difficult to reapply for it again in the future axis is very notorious in this regard\n\npardon me if ive hurt sentiments also feel free to comment if you disagree with anything without being rude\n\nedit removed the mcc on member request \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nps dont judge me as some marketing agent of flipkart or axis im an ardent member of this sub always looking for those tips and hacks also im not against sbi cb hdfc swiggy or millenia i too have sbi cb its a beast that i happily use for other purposes its just that i havent closed my fk axis rn bearing that 590 annually \ud83d\ude05 cuz who knows and axis people have harassed me for petty things in the past if you can use and keep it all better but always look for the value proposition in the long run rather than robothinking the apparent obvious like others in an echo chamber atleast add a tldr because it was tldr \ud83e\udd72\nsbi cashback will likely be nerfed in the future either by increasing annual fees or reducing the 5000 cap and the same goes for others\n\nthis can happen with flipkart too and id dare say that flipkart nerf is more likely given its a loss maker compared to sbi\n\namazon won my loyalty long ago with prime membership and consistency in reliability of service they have great customer service which has always resolved in my favor in the rare case of issues so the icici amazon pay card becomes the obvious choice for general online shopping \n\nhdfc millennia and swiggy cards cover up a lot of other cases and i just got sbi cashback on top of it so theres no reason to even look at a flipkart branded card\n\nalso the supercoin shit seems confusing i seem to earn them but cant redeem them the swiggy cards reward is much better for swiggy anyway so using that for swiggy is a waste\nbro pls remove that sbi mcc part sbi employees might be watching this\ni would counter your perspective on groceries although prices on flipkart are always less the variety is minimum the available options nowhere come near bigbasket or blinkit and the obvious that flipkart doesnt have quick commerce so bb or blinkit wins there\n\nmy purchase behavior is almost similar to yours no myntra and nykaa but almost 4k worth of medicines either from pharmeasy or 1mg\n\nfor amazon icici nonprime members get 3 cb\n\nthe spending criteria doesnt make sense for the majority because it is highly unlikely that someone will spend 1lakh only on one cc for all 12 months\n\nso neither flipkart axis nor apay icici comes close to sbi cb\nsbi cb and flipkart axis both have their own use cases you like flipkart axis over sbi cb because you make substantial purchase on flipkart\nflipkart axis is shit if you try to use it at any other website other than flipkart so yes flipkart axis is good enough on flipkart website but thats about it sbi cb shines everywhere if someones purchase isnt substantial enough on flipkart then flipkart axis is pointless for that person and sbi cb make more sense your post looks more like a marketing for flipkart ecom than comparing flipkart axis with other cards side by side\ni see this more often for people holding amazon pay icici credit card they pretend like it is some really amazing card but its not apay card is pretty basic card and does the same thing as flipkart axis these both cards are pretty much useless outside their respective ecom"}]],"43":[[{"negative":0.9176770449,"neutral":0.0541915409,"positive":0.0281314012,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"weird experience with a blinkit delivery boy today  i ordered groceries from blinkit

so happy and was smiling the whole time and told me that he made 100 on the previous delivery and as soon as he saw my address he rushed to take this delivery he again requested to change the location

trying to buy an avocado the other day and noticed something interesting the price on bigbasket was 89 on blinkit it was 105 and zepto had it for 98 naturally i wondered  if the prices for one item differ this much what about other groceries i checked a few more items and sure enough almost everything had varying prices across platforms due to discounts promotions or delivery fees\n\nthat got me thinking why isnt there a way to easily compare prices across all these grocery apps\n\nimagine a platform where you could simply search for any grocery item and get realtime price comparisons from zepto blinkit bigbasket swiggy instamart and others youd see all the discounts delivery fees and estimated delivery times in one place allowing you to make informed decisions and save money just like you do when booking a hotel on trivago\n\nim planning to build this app and would love feedback suggestions or to connect with anyone who finds this idea exciting lets make grocery shopping smarter and more transparent  \n\nthe real motive behind this idea is to help people with rising costs of living every rupee saved counts i want to empower people to shop smarter save time and make more informed choices this app isnt just about convenience  its about making sure everyone has access to the best deals no matter what theyre buying or where they live\n\n i have done this manually \n\nand no one buys a single product \n\nlets say i need to buy 5 items \n\nitem 1 is cheap on big basket\nitem 2 is cheap on zepto\n\nitem 3 is cheap on instamart\n\nitem 4 is cheap on blinkit \n\netc\n\nthen each app has their minimum order value for free delivery some have rs 99 and some has rs 199 as minimum order value for free delivery\nbecause i will not buy rs 89 avacodo from big basket for 89 then pay delivery fee on it \nso i will not buy avacodo just from big basket as other items are costly on big basket or some items are not available which i need \n\nwhat to do now\n\nget conused and close all apps and buy grocery from neighborhood kirana stores \n\nalso do you know that each of these apps have different suppliers \n\nthe tomato i order from zepto and flipkart minutes are different in quality zepto tomato is costly but also high quality now they dont list the source or tomato or how it was sourced but its better can you compare quality \n\neven if you go to a shop you will find different variety of potato at different price points why because the costlier ones are bright more aesthetic perfect shape \n\nthe cheaper ones have holes little softgot stale a little etc \n\nwhat if big basket sends u the cheaper potato \n\ni have done all price comparison and the grocery in neighborhood small shops is always cheaper and better\nto compare you need their data for their data you need their api access why will they share their internal api access and data with a 3rd party\nlmk if u want a ui ux person i can try\nlets chat dm me\nyou can

if this is considered a startup or not but i wanted to ask regarding setting up a blinkit dark store in tier 3 city i am taking about a city where this will be first of the quick commerce app we already have zomato swiggy food delivery and big basket has 1 day delivery does it make sense to get a blinkit or instamart franchise to setup a dark store in a tier 3 city   business models like blinkit usually only seem financially feasible with economies of scale in its abscene its just burning vc money \n\nunlike your typical kirana store you have a mobile application to maintain ios  android marketing expenditure and delivery partner fees your usual kirana store has no need to spend on these but you do\nlike it depends if people in that city prefer convience  also has high spending power than itll work\ntier 23 cities usually dont have that kind of spending power they would go out and buy it tier 1 cities usually people prefer convenience and are ok to spend a little extra \n\nblinkit and zepto are just burning money to keep the customers with them at any day i would save 510rs if i find a better price in either of the platforms \n\ntier 3 cities also lot of people buy in credit unless you dont have money to burn forget about it\nit depends on the peopleare they aware of such things\nrecently i came across the namm yatri app and loved their business model unlike ola and uber which take a commission on every ride nammayatri uses a subscriptionbased saas approach drivers pay a small daily fee to use the app and the rest of the money goes directly to them it made me think what if we applied this to grocery delivery instead of relying on dark warehouses like zepto we could use the existing network of local kirana stores consumers could use the app for free to place orders without selecting a specific store the app would match their order to the nearest kirana store with stock and delivery agents who pay a small subscription fee would pick up the items and deliver them payments could happen directly through the app to keep things smooth\n\nbut of course there are some challenges\n\t\tstock availability\n\t\tstore hours limitations\n\t\tprice inconsistency can be solved with inapp payments\n\t\tproduct quality\n\nits a simple idea but i think it could really work if executed

from ahmedabad gujarat  found this community much more active and understanding so posting my concern here  ive done a diploma in computer engineering but had to drop out from my b tech 2nd year due to some personal reasons i dont have any highpaying jobs since i have any skills that can get me a decent job but with some basic skills im making good enough to pay my bills currently im trying to learn full stake development but my mental health is just not letting me focus on anything else and the real cause of my destroyed mental health is my debt trap\n\nhow i fall into a debt trap\u00a0i tried to be a nice guy in covid times and i helped my brotherlike best friend financially when loan recovery agents were behind his father in those black covid days but i never knew that helping someone would cause me this much stress and would make me forget how to live a life i helped him with all my savings and investments from stokes i was a fool and for the sake of friendship i helped him he never repaid the amount on time and always kept on giving me dates this stupidity made me fall into a 15x bigger debt trap than what i had helped him with other than that some more series of unfortunate events never let me come out of this trap my dog met with an accident the owner forcefully made us vacant the flat and didnt give us deposit amount in return broker ran away with our money i met with a small bike accident and had to pay the amount at the moment even though there was no fault of mine got scammed by someone worth of 10000 and still never got it back since the bank is sbi and we know how it works recently my 160 worth of crypto got stolen which i had received for completing tasks and that was literally my last money in hand  such ancient kept on happening and never ever let me stand up and come out of this\n\nwhats my current status\u00a0i was in total debt of 15 lakhs but a few months back when it was just unbearable for me i called my father and told him about my situation i couldnt tell him everything because in a conversation over a call he thought that i was too stressed and might harm myself i didnt wanted to give him more stress so i didnt tell him everything but he still managed me around 5 lakhs and i paid my over dues now he thinks everything is clear but its not i cleared another 5 lakhs on my own by working as hard as i was capable of i worked as a blinkit delivery partner i worked for one youtuber and so on\n\nnow 5 lakh is remaining and out of that only 90000 is what i need on urgent basis the rest amount is from some close people

zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying

hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past 3 years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week 75 of viral songs on tiktok started with a paid creator marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower count\n\nthe ftc adopted a click to cancel rule last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships additionally businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online \n\ngoogle is giving its shopping platform a

topic so that teams can prioritize timesensitive threads and their most valuable customers opendesk can also autodraft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history which appear next to the messages pane its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called tickets per order to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business openstore built opendesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40 ecommerce brands it operates and now its opening the tool up to other companies\n\npermira completed its 72b acquisition of squarespace officially taking the company private again with the completion of the deal squarespace is no longer listed on the nyse as part

into the item price and poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure \n\netsy sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward shippo and shipstation will be the only thirdparty shipping services to be offered on the website this means that other providers like pirate ship easyship and shippingeasy will no longer be offered as an integration theres since been much confusion around what this notice actually means pirate ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an email and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using pirate ship they later said they are confident that they will but its all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and etsy \n\n1worldsync released its fourth annual consumer product content benchmark report featuring insights collected from 1750 shoppers across the us and canada a few highlights from the report include 15 indicated that they are shopping on d2c sites more than in 2023 compared to 21 who are using d2c sites less which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces 49 of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews 31 of shoppers now use chatgpt google gemini or other ai assistants to help inform their choices up from 22 last year however consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking just 35 said they found ai tools to be accurate often or always\n\nthe uk government is set to introduce regulations on bnpl products aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices a consultation on the draft legislation began on oct 17th and will remain open until nov 29th with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback the proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks clear disclosures and protections under the consumer duty aligning bnpl with existing credit card rules much like what the us recently did the government would offer a transition period for bnpl companies to catch up to speed to avoid disruptions in the market\n\nmeanwhile in the usa the financial technology association filed a lawsuit challenging the cfpbs new rule on bnpl products saying that the rule oversteps legal bounds in may the cfpb ruled that bnpl vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender fta president and ceo penny lee said unfortunately the cfpbs rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts oversteps legal bounds and risks creating confusion for consumers the cfpb is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of payinfour bnpl products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures in excess of its statutory authority and in an unreasonable manner\n\nformer amazon employee\u00a0stephanie ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company which she previously worked at for six years the

\n\nfirst post here so pardon my writing\nso i ordered a pizza from mojos and the outlet is 15 mins from my place hardly in the app it showed a total waiting of 30 mins smthg i have a tendency of checking my food every min when im on edge i suppose everybody does so after 15 long mins of waiting finally it reaches a point where its out for delivery after 5 to 7 mins roughly the order showed delivered i instantly called the delivery person and guess what hes not answering after 2 attempts i called zomato cs and surprisingly the rep connected me to the delivery guy in an instant and he is saying he gave it to me i was in shorts down near the bldg gate saying he handed it after conforming my name we argued for a while and it was going nowhere at that point i just wanted my food so shutting him of i asked her whats the resolve for this so she said will provide a refund for this within next 24 hrs frustratedly i denied the half assed resolution and asked for same to be reorder she said its not possible u can order it again from the oulet if its open we can only initiate an refund request it was 130am luckily the outlet was open and i reordered again from zomato trying to get a cod this time and found out theres no cod available why paranoid me instantly calling the delivery guy as soon its out for delivery got the food this time still i didnt got my money back yet zomato\n\nive also used blinkit swiggy eatclub zepto it was my first time going through this has anyone faced the same recently if so have u got the refund at the least\nafter this i am unable to trust prepaid orders or zomato the same any more\n\nnotewhy not considering two factor authentication for food deliveries like we get on amazon myntra and flipkart unless someones enjoying exploiting this loop hole deepinder goyal this happened to me also but i dont think its zomato to blame mojo pizza uses their own delivery network so its third party zomato refunded my money as well i wrote to eatclub parent co of mojo pizza regarding the bad experience and they said they raised the issue to the outlet manager never ordering from any eatclub brand again zomato should blacklist eatclub\nits been over a year now my zomato app doesnt show the cod option\nbeen using swiggy good so far had the similar incident as op \nanother delivery person picked my order and my delivery person quickly

i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week 75 of viral songs on tiktok started with a paid creator marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower count\n\nthe ftc adopted a click to cancel rule last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships additionally businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online \n\ngoogle is giving its shopping platform a major overhaul with the help

shipping services to be offered on the website this means that other providers like pirate ship easyship and shippingeasy will no longer be offered as an integration theres since been much confusion around what this notice actually means pirate ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an email and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to

what the us recently did the government would offer a transition period for bnpl companies to catch up to speed to avoid disruptions in the market\n\nmeanwhile in the usa the financial technology

this hell ive been fighting with my problems since lockdown time but not anymore its now out of my control ive paid huge for my personality of being helpful and kind but now im begging god just take me out of this hell its a very long story but ill try to be short but descriptive im writing this because i just wanted to offload all this from my chest\n\nlittle about me\n\nim a 24yearold boy from ahmedabad my family lives in a different city and i live here with my other roommates who are eventually my far and close cousins only im an unemployed guy with no job skills im currently trying to learn web development but mental stress is not letting me focus on anything else\n\nthere was a time in 2020 when my life was on track and was going as i wanted to but then covid hit covid wasnt the problem at all but i helped my best friend with the money and that kindness of mine started spoiling my life since then so many series of unfortunate events never let me come out of the debt trap i am currently in\n\nhelping my friend saga\n\nit was mid2021 and i used to do swing trading at that time me and my other two friends were running one app that was related to fantasy cricket in starting it was working well we were teenage kids and making very much enough from our small app but after the covid hit that app business got ruined but i had made enough savings from it that i could easily do trade in the market and it was going pretty well as well one day i was supposed to get an amount of 60000 somewhere but for some reason i had to receive it in my best friends bank account  it was fine we were like real brothers and it wasnt the first transaction we had done like that \n\nlong story short he used that amount to pay off his dads debt that his dad had taken from some local person who gave money on interest he just used the whole amount without even informing me at all i knew him for years and i knew there must be a good reason for him to do that and there was after hearing the reason i said its alright dont worry but thats not all after a few days he called me and asked for another 10000 to pay his loan overdue i was like what are you doing man is everything alright and just like that within 2 weeks i gave him 80000 i was a college kid and it was my savings only so i was all okay with that since i did not have much use for that shortly but i never knew what kind of trouble i was inviting for me\n\nstory after the help\n\nthat time it was lockdown so i was at my parents but soon everything opened up and i had to come back to ahmedabad for my college i had almost nothing in my pocket i had to sell out my portfolio for my rent food and deposit amount now my only income source was also closed i had decided that id never ask for money from my parents i wish i could have asked for it by leaving my selfrespect or ego aside instead i called and asked him for a date on which he could return my money if not the full amount then some portion at least he said within a month hed give me half something amount i asked him twice if he was sure of this or not and he said yes hell give me back half the amount in a month so i borrowed my monthly expenses from someone else for a month and of course he didnt pay me on time and i had to embrace that guy from whom i had borrowed money my friend told me hed give the full amount next month but i had no faith in him now still i asked my lender to give me another month and this time he asked for interest i had no other option except to accept this and guess what my friend didnt give me anything next month either at that point for the first time in my life i had to go to instant loan apps and take loans from there to pay off my debt caused by my friend from this the cycle of my debttaking from instant loan apps started i had no other option he kept on giving me dates this blunder became a mess day by day\n\nseries of unfortunate events in august 2023  flat shift and taboo mindset of the society\n\nin august 2023 we had to shift our flat we were now a total of 8 roommates so we found a good bungalow with good affordable rent everything was shorted even we confirmed with the owner if theres any issue related to bachelors living in the society or not and he said theres no issue we vacated the old flat loaded our all stuff in the truck and reached to the bungalow when we reached there the watchman didnt let us go inside the society secretary came and said bachelors are not allowed in our society i talked with the owner he came and talked to the secretary after talking with the secretary he came to us and said ab mana bol rahe hai yeh log jab ki pehle maine inko bata rakha tha i was like are you kidding me what are we supposed to do now i had asked you earlier as well and you said theres no issue and now youre saying this shit where im supposed to go we were officially homeless that day we even found another flat but it was expensive and out of our budget still we finalised it and we started unloading our stuff from the truck we had almost shifted all our stuff to the 7th floor and then some society ladies came and asked us who permitted us to unload the truck were not letting bachelors live here in our building humare ghar mein bhi jawan ladkiyan hai i was frustrated for the whole day and again it started like that i told her that who do you think we are a rapist are crazy or what weve already paid the deposit to the owner and he has no issue then who are you guys having a problem with whos living in the owners flat they didnt listen to anything and called the owner and scolded him as if it was her flat even threaten him if hell let us live here shell call the police and that owner didnt want any other stress so he just refunded our deposited money back and we were homeless for the second time in just one day we had to pay the truck driver 4 times more than the predecided fare because of keeping him with us all day the biggest challenge was where we were going to spend the night and where wed put our stuff because we couldnt keep it in the truck anymore there was a friend of ours who had one empty shop which he was using as a godown even that friend took rent from us so we unloaded our all stuff there and then requested our previous owner to let us spend the night at the older flat which we had vacated thankfully he understood our situation and he agreed that day was the most horrible day of my life had no extra money and something like that happened was crazy\n\nin ahmedabad nobody was ready to give a flat to any bachelor the broker we found that day was really helpful he did everything to get us flat we had a really good bond with him and after staying homeless for another 3 days we finally found another bungalow it was cheap and we desperately wanted a roof over our heads we slightly checked out the property and made the deal but after living for a day there we get to know there are many issues that we couldnt identify before you can only get to know that after spending a day or two we requested the owner to refund us our rent by cutting oneday charges but why would someone do that that heartless person gave us just half the rent amount i had no words for what to tell him he knew all these problems were there but he didnt mention them he was like ive 50 properties main kya yeh sab dekhne baithu he was so rude and he had all our money with him so we couldnt say anything to him\n\non top of that while going to visit one property we met with one small accident it wasnt our fault at all a spoiled kid was driving a new car and made an unexpected left turn without a side light on the new car got big scratches and he was a nephew of gunda od that area had to give another 5000 there\n\nnow i was at a stage where i didnt even have enough money to pay the deposit and rent here weve to pay two times of deposit of rent and one rent in advance theres no way i can get money i had to take loans from instant loan apps online\n\non top of that screen of my laptop got broken while shifting now i cant even learn those skills that i was learning to get a job i had no money to repair that screen\n\nindia pakistan world cup match made us homeless again\n\nwe finally got a flat it wasnt good but thats the only option we had and it was beyond our budget but we had to take it we spent a month there but it was way too far from the roommates office and there was not much development around it people from ahmedabad might know that theres not much available for bachelors near agora mall so after a month we requested the owner that if he could give us our full deposit back we would like to shift usually as per the agreement you cant vacant property within 6 months of shifting and if you do youll lose your deposits but here we had requested the owner that if he could give us our deposit then and then only we can to vacant otherwise no so that was the time of the world cup and the indpak match was happening in ahmedabad there were no hotels available for stay the owners relatives got tickets for the match but they couldnt get any hotel to stay and they were coming from kolkata so what he did was horrible he forcefully made us vacant the flat he didnt want to spend a lakh on a hotel just for 1 day stay so he chose to give us 50 of our deposit and made us homeless again he threatened us in every possible way we couldnt do anything except leave the house trust me these peoples connections are so strong that you cant do anything we didnt even have money to give the fare to the truck driver lucky this time we got a stay at my friends place we spend the whole month there\n\ni had given 15000 to that broker who had helped us to find that flat i urgently needed that and we had become good friends by that time at that time it was extra money i had with me so i gave him that was my so big mistake to help him its been my problem now i trust everyone so early that was a really hard lesson i learned by paying so huge and even paying right now as well\n\ncyber fraud\n\nwhile staying at a friends place i became a victim of cyber fraud i was trying to get one big person from the bank to close all my small loans and have just one small monthly amount at that time my cibil score was too good 800 lets not go deep into it but my last 10000 in my bank got lost in this fraud i immediately filed a complaint with cyber cell but its been a year the case is solved but still have yet to get that 10000 back ive spent 3000 in advocate and other stuff for this case every week i go to police station the for updates and they always say that the bank is not even opening the mail were reminding them every time i visit them\n\nfinding a new flat\n\nit was a diwali month last year it was high time we found a place for us since people at my friends flats had started having issues now with us living there so i contacted that broker whom i had already given 15000 so if he can find us a new flat we can set off that amount with his brokerage but he didnt seem interested in finding us a good flat i kept on calling him to return my money and he kept on giving me dates at this point i was relying on my friend for my food bills still i had no option except to keep on finding a new flat just a few days before diwali we got a good flat but the rent was too high but we had no option i was so frustrated with this now only i knew how i was arranging money to pay my monthly emis taking new loans to pay existing loans it was hell now again to pay the deposit amount and advance rent i had to take loans i was helltired of taking loans for everything there was not one thing happening right with me i had no one to tell all these what they would have thought about me i was already stressed and didnt want more stress by telling anyone this i shifted into this flat and since then weve been living here only\n\nin between one roommate left because of his ego and increased our rent burden even more but lucky we found another one in the next 2 months\n\ntelling my parents about my situation\n\nthe water was above my head in april for the first time i wasnt able to pay my emis anyhow all the emis were overdue almost by 2025 days and i was getting threatening calls from those loan recovery agents every 35 min i get one call i had no option except to make my phone on mute and i couldnt even attend the calls from my parents the mental pressure was so great that i started becoming an irritating person i never wanted to take this situation to my parents but i had no other option except to tell them my parents even had asked me previously is everything okay na and i was like yeah yeah everything is great but then i called my dad that day and started telling him every day with my thriving hands tears in my eyes and the voice of a crying person i couldnt tell him everything since his voice started weakening i was a proud son of him he never said it but i can feel it of course i felt like losing all my selfrespect and all my respect in his eyes as i was speaking to him i must say it was the most horrible moment of my life i cant even imagine what my father must be thinking is his son this much idiot is he really failed as a father and what else i just couldnt tell him all the issues with the exact amount of my debt because it was so huge still the next day he arranged the amount i asked for the next morning i immediately paid all the due amount i foreclosed all my loans and now i had to give money to the people whom i had borrowed there was no hurry in giving them back since they were close once and somewhat they knew what i was going through but god did not agree to give me mental peace i had left with 5000 and i started trading in crypto since i was good at it i turned 50  usdt into 150 usdt i was happy that things had started working in my favour but no it was just an illusion only i was owing around 20000 to him and he urgently asked for it from me i said to him okay ill arrange it by tonight since i already had 15000 in crypto i just needed to arrange another 5000 only but when i opened my trust wallet app to sell those crypto i saw that it wasnt there yes was stolen somebody stole it man my mind got blank there were no emotions in my brain i wanted to scream why god why always me i wanted to cry but i got no tears in my eyes i called my friend and asked to know if it was urgent or what and he said he needed it by tonight anyhow so again i was left with no other option except taking another loan \n\nthis is it guys i just cant type more i dont know how long ive been writing\n\ni dont know where my life is going i wanted to write in a more detailed manner but i just cant the stress im having currently is way beyond anyone can even imagine\n\ni do have an income source that gives me around 15000 a month but with that i can old manage my expenses not emis i badly need one big loan using which i can pay off my all debt and organise my debt so that i can come out of this mess but of course thats impossible to happen now since my cibil is destroyed i had started to work as a blinkit delivery boy but it didnt work either because there were many delivery boys already so the potential of your earnings decreased every time when i make up my mind that ill not lose hope and ill do it this shall too pass that every time something crazy hits my life and ruined everything i want to learn web3 development but the amount of pressure i have is just way beyond my capabilities of handling it i cant focus on anything my family thinks im doing a good job and thinking to buy a flat here crazy right yeah thats my life i have no idea how im gonna come out of this mess but ive selfbelief that ill come out of it for sure i dont know why im been able to manage this much pressure whatever setback i have next month i find myself telling that alright god one more but ill come out of this and when i do there will be no look back ive a dream of owning and running hedge fund in india im really sorry for losing from my track in the end im just writing whatever comes to my mind\n\nis there any saviour who can take me out of this hell i dont know how to beg ive never learned that but people of reddit i dont want to lose in life i want to make parents proud i just wanted to share this and i did im not even sure how many people will even read till the end and even dont know whether am i allowed to post something like this on this sub or not if its in my hand to help you  i will surely try to help you but i am broke too  i am sorry brother\ni had a boyfriend once tell me something his father did never borrow money you will be a slave to debt never loan money you wont see it again if you loan something think of it as giving away instead of a temporary measure so unless you have enough to tide you over for three months you can forget almsgiving keep a small account of your expenses to tally your daily cash flow pen and paper mind you if you watch the pennies the dollars will care for themselves as in our case rupees\n\ni want to ask you one thing why did you choose to earn money from crypto it may be a quick way to wealth but the risks of scams and rates crashing are worth considering if you feel that loaning to your friends is important ask yourself if they have treated you the same way consider starting multiple sources of income that are small but steady things accumulate over time so looking for shortcuts may be unwise online jobs are risky and online banking is even worse if you use upi or any other applications consider transferring extra money into a safer bank and keeping some spare cash on hand multiple bank accounts with different plans can help protect against theft keeping your eggs in the same basket is not safe when you can maximise your accounts you will have a better future than most people working hard is important but working smarter saves you from potential dangers\n\nif anything financial literacy is the one thing that can save you from your predicaments i suggest downloading free ebooks on accounting and money management a fun read would be rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki and sharon lechter there is plenty of information online after all debt was the common word of slaves since 3500 bce\n\nas a 20yearold psychology student here is some advice for your mental health while this sounds unprofessional even insignificant i suggest you write three basic tasks to accomplish in one day\n\n1 brush teeth\n2 make bed\n3 shower\n\nbreakfast tidy bed clean table etc any doable goal that you can achieve in about 10 minutes if you complete these three tasks by morning no matter what other tasks fail consider that day a success mark down your tasks in a small calendar after you have finished them continuing that for an entire month  regardless of the outcome of that month you can look back on your three goals and be happy i suggest sticking to three permanent goals to create a habit of discipline\n\ndiscipline is not an inherent trait it is often a habit if you want to create discipline you have to start small by adjusting the easiest things first from brushing your teeth to eating a particular diet you can bring discipline into your career and daily choices by insisting on certain behaviours you can form a value of discipline just like drinking coffee is an ingrained value you create the identity of a coffee drinker if you want to be someone who runs a hedge fund you need a particular set of values its a good idea to invest in discipline time management and budgeting as essential values for achieving your goals\n\nlinkedin is the best networking system for more advice about your future career options networking is a powerful tool and creating connections has better benefits people there want someone to appreciate their achievements so you bring them admiration while they offer experience its a winwin situation why do you think people put so much effort into marrying the right person based on family situations because help from powerful inlaws is easier when youre married to the right bunch the social ties of marriage were like a tool to access different sets of connections now the internet solves these issues so i would hardly suggest finding a wife from a political family\n\nmake good use of these tools and i am sure you will be flying in no time"}]],"135":[[{"negative":0.1484679431,"neutral":0.3797091246,"positive":0.4718229473,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"ideas for new

and what they do is they show news stories and also try to show the political bias of the story by displaying stats like who owns the publication how many times the story has been shared by known conservative or liberal media how each side of the spectrum showsheadlines the news and tries to catch misinformation \nits made in the us and our landscape is quite different to theirs so im not sure how it fares here but something like that for india i think would do well with the younger crowd i personally find it very intriguing \n\nexecution is key and pretty difficult but check it out maybe itll help spark something new\ncan also make something like trustpilot for india as many new website are there which many people would not be trust  also as i am student in jee i see that many techers leave and open their own coaching you can make a platform for which can be just edited but infra is same for all the coaching containing video streaming chats question solving etc feature\nhow about an app that compares prizes in real time hailing a ride compare prices from uber vs ola ordering food compare prices from zomato vs swiggy vs ordering food directly from restaurant similarly for grocery delivery i dont know if any of these platforms have apis that you can utilize for this and that could make this idea a little tricky to implement\nan app to pay all bills in one shot every

fit\n\nhere are some questions you can ask what problem will your app solve who will your target customers be create a rough customer persona and start asking them questions like do you face this problem would you pay for a solution how much would you be willing to pay where can i find more people like you who have the same problem\n\nif your app idea fits the market you can begin assembling a team in your case you might need an onground team to partner with restaurants cabs etc and a development team to build the app"}]],"156":[[{"negative":0.2724388838,"neutral":0.7032801509,"positive":0.0242809113,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"which delivery apps work near the central university  can anyone tell me which
