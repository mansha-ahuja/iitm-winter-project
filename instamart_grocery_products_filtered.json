month\n\n\n\ni have deleted zomato from my phone and we have consciously reduced ordering food online by taking a cook who has a fixed salary every month no surge fee no exorbitant taxes at the checkout page\n\nwe have saved an estimated rs 1500month only on taxes and platform fees that zomato charged for food\n\n\n\nwe use amazon fresh for grocery shopping and put what we need on a list every day and order at the end of every week at once\n\nby doing this we avoid ordering from any quickcommerce apps if you have a dmart around you please go and get it from there nothing can beat those prices\n\n\n\nthese are just a few changes we have made consciously to avoid giving money to platforms that promise convenience often making a hole in our pockets without us realizing it

are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart

prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or

leading even in tier2 and tier3 districts swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its qcommerce quick commerce business to become profitable\n\ntenfold growth is expected in 2028 for the qcommerce

risks and opportunities therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the ipo can signal credibility and thorough due diligence \n\nthe bookrunning lead managers or underwriters to the issue are kotak mahindra capital company jpmorgan india citigroup global markets india bofa securities india jefferies india icici securities and avendus capital most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy\n\n8 qib subscription\n\nwhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning without coming the last moment for filling the qib quota we can believing that qibs are genuinely interested in the ipo and company\n\nqib subscription had zero subscription on day 1 but the number picked up at the end of day 2 to a marginal 28 of the qib portion this means that qibs are showing only mild interest in the ipo unlike bajaj finance which was fully subscribed by qibs on day 1 itself\n\nbut considering the current market sentiments and competition with zomato it is almost certain that swiggy is set to list at a discount especially considering that the gmp of the ipo is at rs 2 less than 1 premium\n\nverdict if you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains although this is far fetched you can invest according to your risk appetite keeping in mind that the ipo is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium\n\n","15":"i live more than 10 kilometers away from lulu mall but i still visit it once a week either on weekends or weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business","16":"what is this i have 2 phone numbers one with swiggy one membership and another with no membership and surprising thing is that the one with membership gives free delivery above rs 199

1852 crores equity shares by existing shareholders  \n  \nmeaning roughly 60 of ipo investors money will be used to give an exit to the vcs like such as accel prosus and tencent only 40 will be used by the company for its operations  \n  \ninformation 2 swiggy reduced its losses to 2350 crore in fy 24 down 43 from last year  \n  \nmeaning its a lossmaking company and looks like it will continue

ipo investing is generally a difficult call its got a 5050 chance i am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets  \n  \nif you found this post useful share it with your friend","30":"for context not a full time farmer but since my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit

mainly planning to leverage its qcommerce quick commerce business to become profitable\n\n2 issue size and split\n\nit is preferable that the fresh\u00a0issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size swiggy ipo is worth 11327 crore and about 40 of it is fresh issue shares which is just about fine to create trust among investors\n\n3 brand name and experienced management\n\na skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an ipo as well as the companys longterm growth swiggy is a startup and doesnt have a big conglomerate to propel the business\n\nhowever the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate adapt to market trends and execute strategies effectively\n\n5 valuation\n\nswiggys management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front\n\n6 clear use of proceeds\n\nthe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the ipo such as for expansion rd or reducing debt\u00a0\n\nas mentioned earlier\u00a0swiggy is looking to grow its qcommerce business\u00a0so a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the ipo  rs 982 crore  is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of instamarts dark store the remaining

her words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom","41":"hi\u00a0\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce

twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide

of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer

to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping

their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps

there any app for instant grocery delivery","43":"hey everyone\n\nive recently moved to jaipur and have been on the lookout for fresh strawberries ive tried blinkit and instamart but they dont seem to have any in stock\n\ndoes anyone know where i can find good strawberries in this season any tips or local market recommendations would be greatly appreciated\n\nthanks in advance\n","44":"tldr frustrated of being defrauded by swiggy instamart of substandard and underweight produce their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices will a consumer courts complaint help me get what i paid for\n\nfeel cheated every time i order from swiggy instamart for the sake of convivence mutiple times they have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense   \n\n\na simple transaction of getting what i paid for as consumer shouldnt be such a gamble swiggy instamart feels like a microgambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to the un concerned team and a take home a promise to of it being  never repeated again in the future  \n\n\ni have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months   on principle i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers it not a small amount i wish we had class action lawsuits in our country   \n1 is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on national consumer helpline portal online  \n2 will my emails to swiggys customer care team be considered as a legal notice wherein ive mentioned it to be considered as such","45":"god bless your day with much happiness joy and love\nhave a peaceful day\nvery good morning \ud83e\udeb4\n\ntodays

instamart around the jayanagar area the hub is located in jayanagar kr road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi jayanagar nr colony srinagar gavipuram  banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nif youre ordering during heavy rains please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged then it falls on the delivery persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n ","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"hi\n\nso i basically wanna order a muscleblaze pre workout but i cannot find swiggy

with local vendor and hence i decided to try ordering from instamart prices were little expensive compared to local market but it was urgency for which i was ready to pay\n\none of the veggiecauliflower made me check all the other ones for their weight most of the vegetables were underweight\n\nswiggy support was shameless including their escalation team as they were not ready to replace the items and were trying to play smart with words for a partial refund\n\nfinally reported the issue to govts ingram consumer helpline and also mailed my bank to reverse credit the amount\n\nconsumer complaint is still open with swiggy responded officialy to the complaint and bank has provided provisional reverse credit for the amount\n\nlesson learnt do not go by weight stickers on products do actually check them and raise complaint when deviation observed\nand ofcourse buy from local vendors it is cheap less cumbersome\ndo not fall for discounts you will end up paying more from your pocket\n","59":"i mean wow seems like they just keep adding \n\nwell many may say why order why dont you cook yourself or go out and get yourself but we all order when its crucial and when we cant and im not blaming the delivery charges but these fancy ways of looting money but this seems just outrageous like they cant charge gst for already mrp products on instamart so a gst on the handling fee apart from the delivery fee \n\nand what the heck is festive season platform fee i mean i feel like this is my cue to plan ahead and avoid this bullshit even though we order only once in a while and go to instamart when we need it the most ","60":"i ordered a 20000 mah power bank on instamart on 4th dec \nafter charging my 4500 mah phone two times the battery has drained

across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many","68":"can you help optimize for

is it fair that we have to pay for expired products while they get away with it what are my options here","76":"priced at 500 something on swiggy instamart \nis this product worth buying for ","77":"my family has no history or interest in using credit cards so i dont know much about them using them as loan service is not what i am looking for my purpose is to find cards that can give cashback or similar rewards\n\nheres more about me\n\n 25m earning 17lpa my salary account is with canara bank simply because its at walking distance from my house will i lose out on much by not switching it to a different bank\n\n not a big spender at all i live with parents and save majority of my money my monthly expenses are about 1520k unless i buy some expensive piece of tech or some computer parts\n\n the above mentioned gadgets and tech stuff is usually bought from third party local vendors who know their products and customers basically i dont order much from amazon its just stuff like hair trimmer rechargable batteries etc id say monthly i spend about 2k or less on amazon so not sure if their card would make much sense for me my dad orders on the behalf of his office friends so he has an active account on both amazon and flipkart but unfortunately he said no for either of their credit cards\n\n i buy expensive stuff like anc headphones or high end phone from croma offline planning to buy a mirrorless camera from their store in future\n\n not a traveller but i am planning to go on international trips once my friend gets settled properly domestic trips are extremely rare for me not exactly dying for lounge access but itd be nice to have it ig\n\n i mostly use swiggy for both instamart and food deliveries recently tried dineout and it seemed fine too id say i spend around 67k monthly on swiggy only this made me consider getting the swiggy hdfc card cause it showed there wont be any extra charges basically what people here call ltf reason why i didnt get it yet is people here dont recommend getting a co branded card first \n\n i dont go out to to eat in restaraunts often id say about once in 2 months\n\n not really interested in buying stuff on emi but i wont mind no cost emi if there are additional discounts i dont know if that is the case generally or if the additional discounts are what give it the meaning no cost\n\n i dont travel much within delhi either i do use uber on occasions my work is mostly wfh and even if i have to go to the office we have transport provided by the office\n\n i am very sketchy of credit cards in general as they basically let you spend money that you dont have which means if it gets lost of stolen someone can put me in massive debt i also see posts of people finding out about loans against there account that they didnt apply for idk how it happens but id definitely like to make sure my information is safe and i dont fall prey to such things\n\n i am not loyal to a brand like apple or samsung i dont have any eco system and neither am i aiming to build one\n\n dont have a car yet might own one in the future but again my fuel expenses wont be a lot\n\n dont have any loans or pending emi\n\n dont have any netflix prime or similar subscriptions i rarely buy pc games mostly sail the high seas\n\n i occasionally buy clothes from hnm uniqlo and myntraa\n\n my mother is really into buying gold stuff but i doubt if theres anything for that\n\n i personally dont use airtel but my parents have a sim card each they also use airtel dth i read about airtel axis card so i can consider getting it and paying for my parents bills\n\n i dont have experience of dealing with banks and stuff as of now i dont even know how to get a credit card is it just an online process do i need to visit bank do i need to call bank id prefer to avoid frequent bank visits and getting on calls\n\n i dont know much about credit score or limit and all that stuff\n\nin the end i only want to use credit cards like my debit card while optimizing cashback rewards swiggy hdfc card showed that id get about 78k cashback per year based on how much i spend on swiggy monthly and thats pretty much what made me consider having one and get to know more about this rabit hole\n\nid be really grateful for good recommendations","78":"hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my

very popular indian supplements company its products are used by runners athletes women and men who think it will clear up their skin and make them fairer people with respiratory problems nac dissolves mucus in your airways addicts to various things including pron drugs smoking etc and ocd and other mental disorders many sports groups in kerala drink their effervescent tablets after matches\n\nnacglutathione is definitely a good medicine you can buy and order it online without prescription but a popular company producing and selling it including on swiggys instamart fast  up is playing a dangerous game with our lives doctors say medicines should ideally be consumed as an oral tablet rather than an effervescent tablet an effervescent tablet is kept in a glass and water is poured in it bubbles up and after a couple of minutes we can drink it\n\ni used to take their products and noticed that it had a couple of sweeteners but since they were given in the form of numerical codes i didnt bother to google now they have started selling it with a white sticker covering the ingredients list i removed it and found their names maltodextrin and dextrose\n\nmaltodextrin is a synthetic substance made from rice corn and some other things it can be gmo in which case it should be avoided by people with digestive issues  \n  \ndiabetes it is highly processed and has a gi glycemic index higher than 100 some websites report it as between 105 and 130 the glycemic index of table sugar is only 75 so not only is this unhealthy for diabetics but it also puts non diabetics at risk it is absorbed into the blood stream at a rapid rate and this can potentially cause diabetes in the long term \n\nlays chips and many of its competitors all use maltodextrin to enhance the flavour if you take nac tablets every day you are spiking your blood levels once or twice a day depending on your frequency but if you eat a huge packet of lays chips full of maltodextrin then you will be spiking it much more almost everything we eat raises our blood sugar levels but things like maltodextrin are very bad since they cause sudden spikes\n\nobesity it is a simple carbohydrate and has no nutritional value therefore large doses can lead to obesity\n\nibd and bowel diseases our intestine contains both good and bad bacteria the good bacteria helps to maintain our mental health and keep our body in good condition maltodextrin kills off the good bacteria and increases the bad bacteria leading to gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease with ibd you will not be able to drink milk and several foods you will also get bloody diarrhoea and constipation on a frequent basis this is an incurable disease but you can put it in remission until it comes back again flareup\n\ndoctors may also do colonoscopy you will have to get naked and they will stick a device up your rectum and go deep into your intestine\n\nhowever multiple recent studies have shown detrimental roles played by maltodextrin in the intestinal environment suggesting that this broadly used food additive may play a role in the rapid increased incidence of chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome in this issue of\u00a0cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology laudisi et\u00a0al1\u00a0add a new line to this list of evidences with the investigation of the impact of maltodextrin on murine models of colitis by using 2 different models of colitis the investigators found that consumption of maltodextrin exacerbated intestinal inflammation in a dosedependent manner mechanistically such detrimental effects of maltodextrin were linked to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent alterations of the protective mucus layer importantly pharmacologic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress was sufficient to prevent maltodextrininduced intestinal inflammation and associated depletion in the mucus layer1\n\n  \n\n\ngas diarrhoea bloating can be caused by high doses of maltodextrin avoid processed foods such as chips and nutrition bars many popular foods contain maltodextrin\n\nsources \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\ndextrose is a very high glycemic index sweetener it is also used as a preservative diabetics may keep a dextrose tablet with them so that if their blood sugar falls too low and they are about to faint chewing the tablet will cause a huge increase in sugar levels this is what fast and up includes in their products\n\nyou are at increased risk of diabetes obesity and even heart and kidney disease due to the high sugar content your kidneys will get stressed excreting them it can also cause fatty liver disease and insulin resistance\n\n\n\nmaybe an athlete will need these sweeteners to increase their energy levels drastically and therefore it is suitable for them but many people with sedentary lifestyles such as elderly respiratory disease patients and children definitely dont need it   \n  \nthey can buy nacglutathione tablets in tablet form only not effervescent tablet it wont be sweet and it actually smells like shit but you dont need to bite it just swallow it with a glass of water and you are good to go it will detoxify your lungs and liver and make your life better and thats because those tablets dont have maltodextrin and dextrose","81":"hi guys im practicing for system design interviews and created a hld for instamartblinkit please review it and suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n","82":"\n\nhi guys i created an app

I've observed huge price gap b\/w BigBasket and offline shops. \n\nBB inflate the prices and then applies discount, so it seems cheaper on the app, but in reality it is expensive.\nNeighbourhood Chicken Shop sells eggs for 60-80\/dozen for 30 eggs that comes around 210-250. You can save 100 by just walking to nearest shop.\nEggs and chicken are something no E-commerce guys have perfected (in my experience in multiple cities). \n\nFor chicken, most of them have screwed up cold storage, and I've received rotten meat multiple times. Only dedicated players like Licious and Fresh to Home have great quality and excellent cleaning in that sense, but the prices are on the high side. \n\nEggs are even worse; local egg roll guy\/chicken shop guy\/Kirana store owner sells a tray of 30 eggs at anywhere from 150-230 INR (depending on season), and it's even less if you buy wholesale. Never a rotten egg amongst them, which is not the case for eggs I've sourced from Swiggy\/Big Basket\/Zepto etc., with them often selling rotten eggs.\n\nI think it's got a lot to do with the folks running these firms; they never sold perishables where QC was in their scope.

Why do you even need grocery delivery in under 30 mins? Services would be much better if no 30min delivery for groceries.\nLet me say that as an NRI who frequents lulu abroad, I don't enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it.\n\nThe crowd and parking.\n\nThe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability. Shopping at Ramachandrans at MOT is less stressful but they don't have extensive product range. If you're looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit, you're most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher.\n\nSpeaking of fruits and veggies, most local vendors don't allow you to pick your own selection. They mix good and stale ones and hand it over. Places like lulu, Ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so.\n\nAnother advantage of Lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops. I don't think the young gen are accustomed or most likely won't be future clients of such local butchery shops.\n\n>Can anyone start a delivery business like Swiggy Instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes, with competitive rates compared to these giants?\n\nDuring covid, after trying many home delivery services, I relied mostly on AM needs and Farmers Fresh Zone. The latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users. The problem with farmers Fresh zone was the products were okayish(not fresh) and their estimated time for delivery uncertain(no live tracking similar to zomato\/swiggy) and it seems they've acquired AM needs now.\n\nHorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet.\n\nComing back to lulu, shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods.\nFrom my experience working in FnV sector\nThese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need daily(even if the supply is low they need it).The company won't directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and stored(the most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storage)to ensure continuous supply.\nSo the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired products.The company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc.. and also there would be anti dumping policies (they can't handle waste so let others handle em) so the vendor after procuring,grading,transporting they would always be at risk of rejection.Because of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium that's why it's expensive.\nThe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster before it goes stale. Farmers are being utilised by the corporate without them knowing it.\n\nFruits and vegetables are not machine made they form naturally there would be defects and problem but you could always choose what's good.Support local business as they are the real backbone of farmers.","16":"Its a one time offer.

Swiggy is one of India's leading food and grocery delivery platforms with a strong market position\\[1\\]\\[2\\].\n\n\n\n2. The company has shown steady revenue growth, with FY24 revenues at Rs 11,634 crore, up 36.1% year-on-year\\[6\\].\n\n\n\n3. Swiggy has expanded into quick commerce through Instamart, which now accounts for 40% of its revenue\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n4. The IPO pricing appears reasonable compared to competitor Zomato, with Swiggy valued at 7.8 times Price\/Sales\\[4\\].\n\n\n\n5. There is strong investor interest, with big investors placing bids worth over $15 billion\\[5\\].\n\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n1. Swiggy is still unprofitable, with a net loss of Rs 2,350 crore in FY24\\[6\\]. Analysts estimate it may take 5-6 quarters to turn profitable\\[9\\].\n\n\n\n2. The company faces intense competition from Zomato, which has outperformed Swiggy recently in revenue and profitability metrics\\[7\\].\n\n\n\n3. There are concerns about urban demand slowdown and foreign investor outflows weighing on the market\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n4. The grey market premium indicates muted listing gains of only around 5%\\[1\\]\\[5\\].\n\n\n\n5. Some analysts caution against investing due to ongoing losses and high valuation\\[4\\].\n\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Swiggy IPO presents a mixed picture. While the company has strong growth potential in the food delivery and quick commerce segments, its lack of profitability and intense competition are key concerns. The reasonable pricing compared to Zomato provides some comfort.\n\n\n\nFor long-term investors comfortable with high risk, the IPO may be worth considering given Swiggy's market position and growth prospects. However, more conservative investors may want to wait for signs of profitability before investing. Those looking for listing gains should likely avoid the IPO given the muted grey market premium.\n\n\n\nUltimately, investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the risks and their own risk appetite before making a decision. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended.\nVerdict: you will get a better price than Amitabh Bachchan to enter the Swiggy stock..chill out right now","33":"Rent in jharpada can go this high.

They are instant liquid mixes so you don't have to do anything except for adding protein of your choice and cook. I've only tried these two flavours and the taste is heavenly and has that exact Bengali taste to it so for those who crave for a good Kosha Mangsho\/Paturi but can't make them, this is an amazing alternative.  \n\nPro tip:   \n\nFor the Kosha Mangsho, even though the packet says you can just add mutton with the liquid and cook instantly ,I first marinade the mutton with the mix and let it sit for six hours and then cook it in mustard oil.  \n\nFor the mustard fish liquid, a little goes a long way since it has a lot of jhaanjh and is spicy as well. So the pack lasted for a week for me and I cooked four dishes- borir jhaal, shorshe bhindi, chingri maach shorshe diye and prawn paturi with it. The paste was good for a week in the fridge.\n\nNext on my list is to try their Chingri Malaikari and Champaran Mutton paste.\nThat kosha mangsho looks freaking delicious.\nBere jinis mosai.

Not sure what to say\nIts not a scam. I think the powerbank is working fine. If you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left, it is fine.\n20k maH Powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure. Thats all.\nLet me see if I can explain this.\nSee what is the voltage of your powerbank. These are normally 3.7 V. So, the total wattage is 3.7 v * 20000 mah = 3.7 V * 20 Ah = 74 Wh.\n\nPhones operate at 5 V. So, a single full charge of the phone need wattage = 5 V * 4500 mAh = 5 V * 4.5 Ah = 22.5 Wh\n\nSo, number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank = 74 \/ 22.5 = 3.28 times. Considering 10-15% wastage, you will be able to charge it around 2.8 times. So, after 2 charges, if it is having some more charge, then I think that the powerbank is fine.

You can buy another powerbank from Amazon \/ Flipkart, but you will probably get similar results.\nWhat were your expectations though?\nIt's not a scam, it's working as expected. I think you are misunderstanding how pb works, as many comments have corrected your expectations.","61":"Why did you start selling chocolates on Amazon?\nDo you think it would be better to sell chocolates directly on your website!\n\nThis is my thought process:\nI have never seen anyone buying chocolates from Amazon until and unless it is for a gift purchase - your keywords should be around gifts!\nHardly anyone would want to try new items and that too from Amazon!\nYou only have 10 reviews which is again quite low!\n\nMy suggestion: Create an insta page if not created till now! Make some viral reels! Partner with micro influencers and direct customers to your website\/Amazon listing if you don\u2019t have a website!\nGather more reviews!\n\nIf you can bid on keywords wrt Dairy Milk\/ Gifts\/ Cadbury or other relevant keywords - Use Helium - Do that!\nIt's because your cost of production is too high. In a country that offers protein bars for 20 and chips packets for 10 at retail points, you cannot grow a business in this segment unless you're creating a legacy brand. Pricing and promotions are your biggest enemies. A majority of Indian consumers like cheap things which is why D2C companies find it so difficult to make profits on premium products.\n\nI'll be brutally honest with you, unless someone is putting a significant amount of investment into this to fix your production line and supply chain, your best bet would be to either treat this as a side hustle or close it down and focus on building a different kind of a company. Don't waste the time that you won't get back after 10 years.\nI would like to help you with your insta, have you tried marketing your chocolates as protein bars or comparing it with other same price category chocolate side by side in a post format or ad format? I can help with that, though I'm not a professional but I know the basics of it.\nYou can give better product at the same price. Or Same product at lesser price.\nCan you tell more about your products like what chocolates are they, some gifting kind or something.

They're a fully fledged dropshipper like Boat, Noise, Boult Audio at this point with a 1000+ employee team. Either way, it is a very shitty business with a very small barrier to entry. If these people stop marketing their products, they're unlikely to beat Unilever with their game with brands such as Lakm\u00e8, Sunsilk Glow & Lovely, Glow & Handsome, Clinic Plus, Ponds, Clear and others.\n\nOutside of Unilever, there's Lor\u00e8al, Maybelline, VLCC, and Emami, who can generate far better profitability and brand recall [and in-house cosmetics and R&D spend on introducing new products].\n\nMamaearth is like Micromax\/Karbon\/Lava of cosmetics industry. The point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as Amazon or Reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of no-name low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as Amazon Basics, Solimo etc.\nMamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products. If you make subpar products you won't last in the market. Why would I buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available. For any cosmetic brand, if you don't have repeat customers, you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it.\nThe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from Amazon.\n\nI really don't understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy it's share.\n\nThey really dont have anything new or niche. \nAnywhere good luck to them and their individual investors.\nHow can quick commerce be competition, they sell through thay channel\n\nBlinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nBaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so I doubt it will get any better\n\nThey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\nDirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of tapping into price conscious market\nProfit kamaye Mera L.

At certain times the product delivered  is either beyond expiry or is stale, has mold\/fungus or infested. This happens with both food and instamart orders.\n2. Non veg food is provided even though vegetarian product wad ordered.\n3. Listing issues where non vegetarian food is listed under vegetarian only items.\n4. Delivery issues where the delivery executive picked up the order and then switched off the phone or refuses to deliver the food.\n5. Delivery executive trying to takeover a customer account by initiating OTP for login and once have access to it, they change the phone number and email and then order bulk food and groceries at their preferred location with cash on delivery without paying.(happy to share more information on this as this happened a while back with me and wife).\n6. Under weight items delivered vs promised weight.\n\nEarlier swiggy used to own all such issues and help out customers by either replacing items, banning a restaurant or giving a full refund and used to charge a lot less. Ofcourse they wanted to onboard more customers and hence were helpful.\n\nNow they charge high amount of different fees, surcharge etc. But when you report an issue there responses are:-\n1. Swiggy is only an aggrigator, use Google to put in a negative review.\n2. A user waiting for their food or groceries for few hours and support tells them they cannot cancel the order, if cancelled all charges will be paid by user. This too when delivery executive is not picking calls or refusing to deliver the order.\n3. For underweight, stale, pest infested items, missing items, either refusing refund or giving partial refund which does not even matches the price of affected items.\n\nThis will be a long list hence will leave it to others to add.\nThank you for taking this up!\nSwiggy and zomato give lesser benefits to their most loyal customers. \n\nRecently, an ASCI study revealed that 52 out of 53 apps they examined had dark design patterns.\n\n\n\nMany of us are familiar with the common dark patterns used by apps. I want to list a few less obvious dark patterns:\n\n\n\n**Variable Pricing**: The pricing for Swiggy One and Zomato Gold varies from user to user. The more frequently you order food, the higher the price for you. This is because the platforms are compensating for the loss of profit on delivery charges. Some users even have a negative score, meaning they aren't shown the option to buy Zomato Gold.\n\n\n\n**Limited Options in Bad Weather**: If you buy Swiggy One, you might find yourself at a disadvantage during rainy weather, which is common in Bangalore. When it rains, you'll be shown fewer restaurant options, and many become undeliverable. You can test this yourself the next time it rains. Many restaurants are available for non-Swiggy One users but are not available for Swiggy One users, possibly due to the delivery charge.\n\n\n\n**Increasing Prices at Favorite Restaurants**: The more often you order from your favorite restaurant, the higher the prices become. You'll receive fewer discounts with each order.\n\n\n\n**Packing Charges**: Charging \u20b950 for packing is outrageous; it's robbery.\nDelivery distance - I have a post here https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swiggy\/s\/uiF0pMmSLj.\nPlatform fees. What and why the heck is that even a thing , I\u2019ll never know. They already markup prices. What is this fee for?

Highlights include:\u00a0\n\n**Resold at Walmart**\u00a0\u2013 Third-party sellers can now offer used items for the first time across categories including luxury fashion, electronics,\u00a0 collectibles, and sporting goods. Walmart's assortment of used products currently includes 5M items from more than 1,700 performance-managed sellers. The used marketplace builds upon the Walmart Restored storefront that launched in 2022, which sells a collection of refurbished electronics and small appliances.\n\n**Multi Channel Fulfillment**\u00a0\u2013 Merchants can now use Walmart Fulfillment Services to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain. Walmart will fulfill the orders and manage returns in plain, unbranded packaging with fast shipping at rates it says will average 15% lower than the competition. The program launches for the first time on Sep 10th, in time for the holidays. That's huge!\n\n**Walmart Cross Border**\u00a0\u2013 A new import service for full-container-load shipments where Walmart Fulfillment Services directly handles the transportation of inbound goods from ports of origin in Asia to facilities across the US.\n\n**Open Carrier Network**\u00a0\u2013 Sellers on the Walmart Preferred Carrier Program can now choose to ship an entire truckload at special rates through carriers vetted by Walmart.\n\n**Walmart LocalFinds**\u00a0\u2013 Walmart is introducing a new program that offers customers the ability to find sellers\u2019 merchandise in their local vicinities and then have the goods delivered via Walmart's last-mile delivery network.

Highlights include:\u00a0\n\n**Resold at Walmart**\u00a0\u2013 Third-party sellers can now offer used items for the first time across categories including luxury fashion, electronics,\u00a0 collectibles, and sporting goods. Walmart's assortment of used products currently includes 5M items from more than 1,700 performance-managed sellers. The used marketplace builds upon the Walmart Restored storefront that launched in 2022, which sells a collection of refurbished electronics and small appliances.\n\n**Multi Channel Fulfillment**\u00a0\u2013 Merchants can now use Walmart Fulfillment Services to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain. Walmart will fulfill the orders and manage returns in plain, unbranded packaging with fast shipping at rates it says will average 15% lower than the competition. The program launches for the first time on Sep 10th, in time for the holidays. That's huge!\n\n**Walmart Cross Border**\u00a0\u2013 A new import service for full-container-load shipments where Walmart Fulfillment Services directly handles the transportation of inbound goods from ports of origin in Asia to facilities across the US.\n\n**Open Carrier Network**\u00a0\u2013 Sellers on the Walmart Preferred Carrier Program can now choose to ship an entire truckload at special rates through carriers vetted by Walmart.\n\n**Walmart LocalFinds**\u00a0\u2013 Walmart is introducing a new program that offers customers the ability to find sellers\u2019 merchandise in their local vicinities and then have the goods delivered via Walmart's last-mile delivery network. The service launches this fall in Atlanta and Dallas with other cities to follow. 1-800-Flowers will be the first nationwide seller to participate.\n\n**Premium Beauty**\u00a0\u2013 Walmart is launching a new premium beauty assortment on its marketplace with more than 20 brands including COSRX, T3, and Beachwaver.\u00a0\n\n**Collector Shop**\u00a0\u2013 Walmart is launching a new collector shop that enables sellers to offer pre-orders for product drops, including releases that are exclusive to Walmart. Eligible sellers can receive 0% commission fees for collectibles through Oct 31st on categories including action figures, dolls, trading cards, sports memorabilia, and comicbooks.\u00a0*\u201cCrap!\u201d*\u00a0said eBay.\u00a0\n\n**Revamped Global Seller Center**\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 The new dashboard and app make it easier to sell in the US, Mexico, Chile, and Canada with free translations. Attendees of the summit will be the first to access the new cross-listing capability and free translations.\u00a0\n\n**Waived Peak Season Storage Fees**\u00a0\u2013 for sellers who inbound inventory by Sep 30th.\n\n**Walmart Marketplace Capital**\u00a0\u2013 is expanding to offer sellers access to cash advances up to $5M.\n\n**New Deals Dashboard**\u00a0\u2013 streamlines the process for sellers to enroll items in Walmart's deals events and provides additional seller data and insights.\u00a0\n\nManish Joneja, Senior VP of Walmart Marketplace and WFS, said, \u201cSellers are looking for a smart path for growth. We\u2019re bringing all the pieces together to be much more than a marketplace and investing in new ways for sellers to serve customers as we grow together.\u201d\n\nWalmart Marketplace has achieved more than 30% sales growth in each of the past four quarters, and the number of third-party seller listings on [Walmart.com](http:\/\/Walmart.com) grew 20% during fiscal 2023.","93":"100g me 114g protein? \ud83e\udd2f\nAndar jaake cell double karega kya apne bc\nLmao it's a misprint, 14 g hoga\nLabel is misleading and fake avoid this\nRegardless of everything else, It has Sodium Nitrite (INS 250), which studies have shown, causes colon cancer in the long term. \n\nAvoid processed meats in general.\n\nPersonally, i do consume them, but more as a very (VERY)  occasional treat, instead of as a source of protein.\nFile a case, become a millionaire","94":"Thank you for your submission to r\/IndianBeautyBazaar .

Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","11":"Need help on getting the Swiggy HDFC LTF Credit card  I have salary account and two LTF credit cards in HDFC.\n\n1.

","13":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","14":"Swiggy IPO last-day quick analysis 1.Company fundamentals:\n\nSimilar to its competitor Zomato during its IPO in 2021, Swiggy is also recording net losses year after year. Although the losses are narrowing down with time, Swiggy faces intense competition in business from Zomato which has captured a lot of market share. \n\nSo, Swiggy's path to profitability is filled with challenges, including Zomato catering and leading even in tier-2 and tier-3 districts. Swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its Q-commerce (quick commerce) business to become profitable.\n\nTenfold growth is expected in 2028 for the Qcommerce segment, and the quick growth in the number of dark stores in recent times are the major factors Swiggy would want to use to drive its business growth.\n\n2. Issue size and split\n\nIt is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. Swiggy IPO is worth 11,327 crore and about 40% of it is fresh issue shares, which is just about fine to create trust among investors.\n\n3. Brand name and experienced Management\n\nA skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company\u2019s long-term growth. Swiggy is a startup and doesn't have a big conglomerate to propel the business.\n\nHowever, the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate, adapt to market trends, and execute strategies effectively.\n\n5. Valuation\n\nSwiggy's management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front.\n\n6. Clear Use of Proceeds\n\nThe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the IPO, such as for expansion, R&D, or reducing debt. \n\nAs mentioned earlier Swiggy is looking to grow its Q-commerce business. So a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the IPO \u2013 Rs 982 crore \u2013 is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of Instamart\u2019s dark store. The remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in Scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same Scootsy segment.\n\n7. Strong underwriting team\n\nUnderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company, scrutinizing its financial statements, business model, management team, and future prospects. This process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities. Therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO can signal credibility and thorough due diligence. \n\nThe book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, JPMorgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Jefferies India, ICICI Securities, and Avendus Capital. Most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy.\n\n8. QIB subscription:\n\nWhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning, without coming the last moment for filling the QIB quota, we can believing that QIBs are genuinely interested in the IPO and company.\n\nQIB subscription had zero subscription on day 1 but the number picked up at the end of day 2 to a marginal 28% of the QIB portion. This means that QIBs are showing only mild interest in the IPO unlike Bajaj Finance which was fully subscribed by QIBs on day 1 itself.\n\nBut considering the current market sentiments and competition with Zomato, it is almost certain that Swiggy is set to list at a discount. Especially considering that the GMP of the IPO is at Rs. 2 (less than 1% premium).\n\nVerdict: If you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains (although this is far fetched), you can invest according to your risk appetite, keeping in mind that the IPO is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium.\n\n","15":"Weekend Rant : LULU MALL  I live more than 10 kilometers away from LULU Mall, but I still visit it once a week, either on weekends or weekdays. Lately, I've been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to LULU for groceries, thinking their veggies are of better quality. We can't just ignore local vendors, even if they are overpriced and assume they don't provide quality. I\u2019ve compared prices and found that local groceries are about +\/- 70 rupees cheaper\/more expensive. Considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies, how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately?\n\nIt's not just about the money. My biggest concern is, why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries? Don't say we don't only go for groceries, many people does this. We're wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic. The traffic and parking at LULU are overcrowded. Is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall, only to find there\u2019s not even enough space to sit? Who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries? Don't ask  are you buying from Online(Amazon,Flipkart) or Offline. I find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality. I'm just saying, only Groceries DO NOT BUY GROCERIES AT LULU, SPENDING YOUR TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY\u2014IT IS A TOTAL WASTE.\n\nCan anyone prove that LULU's vegetables are better? They are super duper expensive, and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop. How can a local street vendor compete against these BIG BIG SUPERMARKETS daily? Some people say that's why Swiggy Instamart is there to support these vendors, but that's another topic for debate.\n\nCan anyone start a delivery business like Swiggy Instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes, with competitive rates compared to these giants? Let's say, Swiggy at 120, LULU at 110, and Amazon Fresh at 115. We offer 120 + 20 for delivery as well, plus if you subscribe, we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription. It can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors. Nowadays, no one can escape ratings and reviews\u2014it's competition in itself. So, vendors won't send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business.","16":"What is this  What is this i have 2 phone numbers one with Swiggy one membership and another with no membership. And surprising thing is that the one with Membership gives free delivery above Rs 199 and the one with no membership gives free delivery above rs 99 like what is this? I am paying for a membership and I have to order more for free delivery. It's not like one with no membership is new swiggy account I order from both account frequently one is my mother's phone account and another is mine and i order once a week from instamart but this.","17":"Swiggy IPO 5 Key takeaways Here are the top 5 key takeaways from Swiggy's upcoming IPO:\n\n1. IPO Details: Swiggy's IPO is open for subscription from November 6 to 8, 2024, with a price range set between \u20b9371 and \u20b9390 per share, targeting to raise around $1.35 billion.\n\n\n2. Valuation: Swiggy is expected to be valued at approximately $11.3 billion, a reduction from its earlier $15 billion valuation, reflecting current market conditions.\n\n\n3. Structure of Offering: The IPO includes a fresh issue of \u20b93,750 crore and an offer-for-sale of 185.3 million shares by existing shareholders, including notable investors like Prosus, Accel, and Tencent.\n\n\n4. Utilization of Funds: The funds raised will largely support Swiggy's expansion in its quick commerce segment, Instamart, including infrastructure enhancements like larger warehouses.\n\n\n5. Investor Interest: Despite a cautious grey market outlook, Swiggy\u2019s IPO has drawn strong interest from institutional investors, including Norges Bank and Fidelity, signaling confidence in the company's long-term growth potential.\n\n\n\n","18":"Fresh Orange Peppers and Capsicum in Nagpur?

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending. A new consumer trends report found that 45% of surveyed Americans have bought something on TikTok.\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0and\u00a0**Klarna**\u00a0are\u00a0expanding their partnership\u00a0to key European markets including the UK, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain with more markets coming soon. eBay users in those markets can now take advantage of Klarna's BNPL payment options, while Klarna users can now resell items bought through its app on eBay with automatic listing details and images.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is offering US users\u00a0$50 shopping credits\u00a0for inviting friends to join the app. The promotions are appearing on users\u2019 \u201cFor You\u201d page. The program is similar to the rewards program that TikTok offered in Europe earlier in the year, which paid users for their activity in-stream, but TikTok was forced to pull that campaign in August after the EU Commission began looking into it as a potential violation of its Digital Services Act. Sounds like TikTok is real concerned about that US ban\u2026\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0delayed the deployment\u00a0of Microsoft Office suite for a year as the two companies work to resolve Amazon's concerns about the security of the bundle of e-mail and productivity software. Microsoft signed a deal last year to provide Amazon employees with Microsoft 365, replacing the company's long time use of Office installed on its own servers, but Amazon paused the rollout after Microsoft discovered that a Russia hacker group gained access to some of its employees\u2019 email accounts.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced\u00a0its plans to enable over $80B in cumulative e-commerce exports from India by 2030, which is 4x more than its pledged of $20B by 2025. The effort will be driven by a combination of enabling exports through Amazon's Global Selling program and through sourcing Made-in-India products to be sold on its global marketplaces. I can't wait to hear what Shri Piyush Goyal has to say about that!\u00a0\n___\n**A group of Amazon shareholders**\u00a0submitted a proposal\u00a0to add Bitcoin to the company's balance sheet, urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy, which heavily invested in the cryptocurrency, resulting in an increase in its share price. The proposal wrote, \u201cMicroStrategy \u2014 which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.\u201d That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever read. If shareholders want to diversify into Bitcoin, sell some of your Amazon stock and buy some Bitcoin! You don't need Amazon to do it for you.\n___\n**European regulators**\u00a0asked Google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0that skirted the company's rules on how minors should be treated online, which could lead to a formal investigation. Officials are looking into a series of ad campaigns promoting Instagram to teenagers on YouTube and have ordered lawyers for Alphabet to review and collate data, presentations, internal chats, and e-mails related to the ad campaigns.\n___\n**Instagram**\u00a0launched a global rollout\u00a0of \u201ctrial reels\u201d after experimenting with the feature back in May. Trial reels enable creators to test new ideas for videos on new audiences before expanding to their followers. The reels are shown first only to non-followers so that creators can gauge performance insights for the first 24 hours after publishing, before deciding whether to share it with their actual followers. I'd be publishing all my reels that way! Sounds like a great hack to reach non-followers and subsequently gain new followers.\n___\n**Amazon's online pharmacy**\u00a0could generate $2B in revenue\u00a0this year, according to the financial firm Evercore. A record 45% of Amazon customers surveyed said they were \u201cextremely interested\u201d or \u201cvery interested\u201d in buying online medications from the company, up from 34% last year and from 14% in 2020, marking the largest YoY increase in purchase intent in eight years.\n___\nPlus a record 21 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Loop**, a returns management platform for e-commerce brands, acquired **Wonderment**, a customer experience and advanced order tracking platform for Shopify merchants.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Karan Johar, Rahul Dravid, Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit invested in Swiggy.  \n  \nWhat are you waiting for?  \n  \nMe: \u201cMeaningful information to take a call.\u201d  \n  \nInformation 1: Swiggy IPO is a mix of fresh issue of equity shares totaling to \u20b93,750 crore and an offer-for-sale of 18.52 crores equity shares by existing shareholders.  \n  \nMeaning: Roughly 60% of IPO investors\u2019 money will be used to give an exit to the VCs like such as Accel, Prosus, and Tencent. Only 40% will be used by the company for it's operations.  \n  \nInformation 2: Swiggy reduced its losses to \u20b92,350 crore in FY 24, down 43% from last year.  \n  \nMeaning: It's a loss-making company and looks like it will continue to be making losses for some more time.  \n  \nInformation 3: \u20b9559.1 crore of the fresh issue will be used for setting up dark stores  \n  \nMeaning: It's betting big on quick commerce. As per THE KEN, Swiggy instamart is the slowest in delivery time and the average order value is almost the same as Zepto and BB Now. Blinkit is way ahead of it in all parameters. So somewhere needed there.  \n  \nSummary: Pre IPO investing is generally a difficult call. It's got a 50:50 chance. I am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets.  \n  \nIf you found this post useful, share it with your friend.","30":"How to get reasonable price for horticrops?  For context not a full time farmer but since my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement, he ventured into farming(which actually keeps him happy as well). \n\nHave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use. I help him whenever I'm back home. \n\nHome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market. A whole difference in taste and freshness. \n\nAs we can't consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family, we try to sell them outside. \n\nThe problem like everyone knows is the price.\n\nHere's how our experience have been so far:\n\n1)Neighbours: There are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but can't take away larger quantities. \n\n2) Small shops: Some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low, they too purchase small quantity. Then there are shops that lowball us. I mean sure they get stuff from TN sprayed with God knows what, cheaply. Obviously we can't match their price. \n\n3) Larger shops are a whole different level. They are happy to take our produce but won't give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically. Post unloading, they give low ball offer. At this stage, we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away. \n\nHave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences. They give us rural rates and sell at urban prices. I wouldn't like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce, those are the ones. \n\n4) Apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface. They charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them. They won't let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer. They also charge higher commissions(not reasonable). Their back end support system is bad too. They often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints, it gets deducted from us. (The customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it). \n\n5) Farming societies don't operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent. \n\n6) Local markets: Here too the goods get loaded are from other states. Getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce. \n\nTo see how crazy the price(particularly when horticrops don't have MRP) is, sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for Rs35 a kg(initially offered Rs30). \n\nA quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of Rs75 a kg(this after crossing out Rs99). \ud83d\ude02\n\nNow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience. And how much the farmer earns from it. \n\nWe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do. \n\nEverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers, but nothing actually flows down. \n\nCan't really compete with the TN produce. But without encouraging farming in our state, we are putting our state food security at risk. What happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams? \n\nI've heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee, so people buy goods produced in our state. But I've not seen any. \n\nWhile govt spends money on apps for activities like OTT, ride sharing(not functional now) and others, why isn't a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing. \n\nThere is a Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council of Kerala(VFPCK) which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable.

Company fundamentals:\n\nSimilar to its competitor Zomato during its IPO in 2021, Swiggy is also recording net losses year after\u00a0year. Although the losses are narrowing down with time, Swiggy faces intense competition in business from Zomato which has captured a lot of market share.\u00a0\n\nSo, Swiggy's path to profitability is filled with challenges, including Zomato catering and leading even in tier-2 and tier-3 districts. Swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its Q-commerce (quick commerce) business to become profitable.\n\n2. Issue size and split\n\nIt is preferable that the fresh\u00a0issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size. Swiggy IPO is worth 11,327 crore and about 40% of it is fresh issue shares, which is just about fine to create trust among investors.\n\n3. Brand name and experienced Management\n\nA skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an IPO as well as the company\u2019s long-term growth. Swiggy is a startup and doesn't have a big conglomerate to propel the business.\n\nHowever, the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate, adapt to market trends, and execute strategies effectively.\n\n5. Valuation\n\nSwiggy's management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front.\n\n6. Clear Use of Proceeds\n\nThe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the IPO, such as for expansion, R&D, or reducing debt.\u00a0\n\nAs mentioned earlier\u00a0Swiggy is looking to grow its Q-commerce business.\u00a0So a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the IPO \u2013 Rs 982 crore \u2013 is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of Instamart\u2019s dark store. The remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in Scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same Scootsy segment.\n\n7. Strong underwriting team\n\nUnderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company, scrutinizing its financial statements, business model, management team, and future prospects. This process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities. Therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the IPO can signal credibility and thorough due diligence.\u00a0\n\nThe book-running lead managers or underwriters to the issue are Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, JPMorgan India, Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Jefferies India, ICICI Securities, and Avendus Capital. Most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy.\n\nBut considering the current market sentiments and competition with Zomato, it is almost certain that Swiggy is set to list at a discount. Especially considering that the GMP of the IPO is at Rs. 12 (just a 4% premium).\n\nVerdict: If you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains (although this is far fetched), you can invest according to your risk appetite, keeping in mind that the IPO is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium.","33":"2BHK Family Rent to be available from November 2024 Location: Canal Road, Shanti Nagar, Jharapada\n\nRoom Content: Drawing-Dining Hall, Master Bedroom, Kitchen, Guest Bedroom, 1x Attach Bathroom(Indian), 1x Common Bathroom( Western), Puja Room attached to Master Bedroom. \n\nEast Facing.

Now none of them appear to be available on the aforementioned successors (Zepto, Instamart, and Amazon Fresh). \n\nDoes anybody here know of services at par with or better than DeepRooted offering these slightly exotic vegetables and fruits?\n\nMy mom asked me for alternatives, and I am turning to r\/Bangalore for answers. \nThank you.","36":"New (potential) card suggestion needed Hey folks, I have repetedly been offered 2 credit cards by HDFC Bank - Millennia & Diners Club Privilege (DCP) both LTF and no annual charges.\n\nI already have an ICICI Sapphiro with a good credit limit which I mainly use for the BMS BoGo offer and if I find any ICICI related discounts on Swiggy\/Zomato\/Amz.\nI also recently got the Airtel Axis CC which I have been using as my main card for all Swiggy\/Zomato\/Bigbasket, Airtel bills and any Axis-offer related purchases.\n\nMy cibil as of last report is >770, and my main spends as already mentioned are Swiggy\/zomato\/bigbasket\/amz fresh\/instamart\/blinkit, Amz\/flipkart, Uber, BMS movie tickets & a couple trips every 3-6 months.\n\nI'm not very hellbent on getting another cc (could be my third) but since it would be LTF I'm actually considering it.\nWould like to know your suggestions. \nThanks!\n\n\nEdit: Since I'm expecting some suggestions for me to go for co-branded cards, I would rather prefer taking a core HDFC card so that in the future I can potentially get it upgraded to the premium ones, relating to whatever I have read in this sub.","37":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","38":"Had to visit so many shops just to get Cadbury celebrations boxes. So I had to get a few boxes of Cadbury celebrations for my office for an event, only condition was I had to get the gst bill so that I can reimburse it later. So I thought I'll go to Dmart and get the boxes. So I went in the evening but I could only find two boxes there, both were opened and empty. Then I went to Ondoor store, they didn't have any. Then I went to Bazaar on dwaar, again no luck. Then I went to a bakery, they had it stock but couldn't provide a bill with gst number so I had to come empty handed. Then I went to Vishal mega Mart but they also didn't have any boxes.\n\nSo I came back home and thought I'll get the boxes delivered online via Instamart or blinkit but both apps were showing out of stock for my home location and office location. So I thought ok, I'll get the chocolates from another dmart tomorrow while going to office.\n\nBut when I went there at around 8:30 am, they said they'll open at 10 am. The dmart near my house opens at 8 am but this one open a bit late. Again no luck. So I thought I'll reach office and searched for another supermarket near my office. There was one reliance fresh which was a bit further from office but I thought what the heck. So I went there, there was one box but I needed more. So I came out empty handed and then went to another Vishal mega Mart in opposite direction. Again no luck, I didn't enter, from the outside only they showed me one small fridge with a few chocolates. Then I went further down the road to a sweet shop to try my luck but they only had sweet boxes. Finally I went to Reliance Smart. They were separating bad bananas from good ones. I asked and my prayer was finally answered. I took the boxes and finally went to office and decided to never volunteer for any event in future. Had poha jalebi on the way to office and finally reached office. But only 6 people joined the event out of 26, that too they kept going in and out of conference room. Aise kismat hai hamari.","39":"Looking for card recommendations, thanks in advance Hi, hope everyone's having a great day.\n\nI am looking to get a credit card, or a few, to optimise cashback\/points. I think an outline of my monthly expenditure that I think I can put on the card(s) would be helpful:\n\n1. Rent- 25k\n2. Groceries- 5k (I have a tiffin service, hence this is low\ud83d\ude2c)\n3. Dining- 8k\n4. Swiggy\/Zomato- 5k\n5. Phone + Subscriptions- 2k (although some are billed annually)\n6. Movies- 2k (tickets+confectionary)\n7. Petrol- 4k\n8. Amazon- 2k\n9. Offline spends- 5k\n\nApart from these expenses, maybe the odd yearly large purchase.\n\nI only have a DCB metal currently (add-on from my brother), and I have been buying vouchers for Swiggy and Amazon, so dining (dineout), groceries (instamart and amazon fresh) and delivery get taken care of this way. Having this card also takes lounge access off my list of priorities needed in the card.\n\nFurthermore, I am eligible for sapphiro through the alumni program, though I am yet to apply for it. For anyone who's applied and gotten it, any tips would be appreciated. (Ques: do I have to be eligible salary-wise as well? What supporting documents do they require?)\n\nI make 1 or 2 trips a year to my hometown, so I was eyeing an airline card too (maybe the Vistara ones, premium economy\/business class tickets do sound very tempting).\n\nI also don't like the idea of paying joining or annual fees. I would like to avoid that as much as possible. I know getting a fyf (subsequently, a waiver after spends) or a ltf card may prove to be difficult but I am looking for suggestions that may eventually offer the possibility at the very least.\n\nApart from this, I think HDFC Swiggy may be a good option. Sorry if this feels all over the place, at the end of the day I just want to maximise the value I can get from my expenses, in any way cashback, points etc. Any and all inputs will be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, I already bank with ICICI and HDFC if that's of any consideration. \n\nThank you for your time.","40":"SWIGGY INSTAMART delivered items with HARPIC BLEACH all over them ! WARNING AGAINST USING SWIGGY INSTAMART, AND RANT (posting on behalf of a friend in her words) : \n31F booked an order on SWIGGY INSTAMART for several house hold items and FOOD products today for Rs. 2400. Even added a tip for the delivery agent. \n\nI had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofa's armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately. Just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where I unpack groceries, I started to faintly smell BLEACH (Harpic). \n\nI was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as I cut open the top of the bag. Delivery agent was gone by then. There was light\/no wetness on items at the top, but the more I got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items. The bleach smell from the Harpic Bleach (white bottles) fumes I had ordered was very strong, even burning my eyes slightly at this point. \n\n\nI took pictures and sent it on Swiggy Instamart chat. There is a pool of bleach at the bottom. There is even a picture where I lifted the bag up and there's so much bleach on the kitchen counter !!! It leaked through the bag\/holes in it!!\nSWIGGY INSTAMART COMPLEYELY REFUSED TO REPLACE\/REFUND\/EXCHANGE ! \n\n\nMy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point. Checked and found that the spot on my sofa's armrest where I put the bag down while taking the delivery was SOAKED in bleach ! I started to panic-clean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that we're not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical. \n\n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\nSWIGGY called me since I wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for ONE LEAKING BLEACH BOTTLE. And later closed the chat saying they don't see anything wrong with the pics so won't even process that refund !!!\nThey didn't even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching, touch-transfering, and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner !!! \n\n\nI offered several solutions : \n1. REVERSE PICKUP ALL ITEMS AND GIVE ME A FULL REFUND. Gurmeet Kaur (supervisor) refused. Why ?? \n2. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OK FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL ITEMS AND REPLACE IT WITH A FRESH ORDER. They didn't even want to speak about solutioning this ! \n3. I asked for an exchange\/full refund of all food products atleast, since bleach can literally hospitalize\/kill you ! She REFUSED !! I had sent 5-7 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said I need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it. I told her you can't see wetness on all products unless it's dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help ???  And I had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and we're getting exposed to it. \n4. Even if there's a chance few other items didn't make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach. Bleach FUMES are enough to contaminate any thing. I would not risk mine or anybody's health by allowing them to eat these items. Basic common sense. I had bought snacks for visiting kids today. But she refused to agree there was even a problem here !! \n5. Not only do I have to throw several of the items I ordered cause they are no longer safe, I also have to clean my counter tops, get rid of all exposed items\/bags into sealed clean bags, I also need to clean my sofa !! I don't even know how to remove bleach from a sofa !! Not to mention bleach will discolour clothes\/fabric !! It's a dark coloured sofa ! \n\n\nSwiggy thinks it's safe for their customers to use\/eat products from the same bag as leaking bleach ! They took zero responsibility for wasting my time, effort (ordering, waiting for delivery, talking to them on chat\/call, and CLEANING THE MESS AND HEALTH HAZARD they caused), my WASTED MONEY or for potentially compromising the health of others like this ! Are these their company's quality of service, standards and principles ??\n\n\nNote - I understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery I easily spend about Rs. 14,000-17,000 per month on their app for years now, very rarely raising issues. \n\n\nLessons learned\/For everybody reading this, \n1. Please don't order toxic or harmful substances like Harpic\/bathroom or toilet cleaners, floor cleaners, drain cleaners, naphthalene balls, dishwashing liquids, etc from SWIGGY INSTAMART since they use flimsy, non-leak proof bags, and don't segregate food items from chemical items while delivering. I will only order groceries from BigBasket from now onwards.\n2. Atleast order food items and other things in SEPERATE ORDERS.\n3. Check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since SWIGGY INSTAMART WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN CASE OF COMPROMISED PRODUCTS.\n4. Take pictures, videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system, or for social media. \n\n\nAm I being unreasonable expecting Swiggy to take responsibility here ? It shocks me that they didn't take any actions to correct such a health hazard ! \nPictures attached (zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom)","41":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 22nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon \u201cmakes up about one-tenth of our profits, but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, a store associate who worked at a UPS Store near Dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day. \u2014 According to The Washington Post\n___\n**Amazon Prime Day shoppers** in the US spent more than $14B this year during Amazon's 48-hour sales event, up 11% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. Amazon described this year's Prime Day event as the \u201cthe biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales and more items sold during the two-day event than any previous Prime Day event.\u201d The company also noted that a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, but it did not provide exact figures, which is typical for Amazon (and why sales estimates always come from third-party analytic companies like Adobe).\n___\n**All those Amazon Prime Day sales mentioned above** \u2014 they come at a price. Fast Company reports that Prime Day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers. Last week the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into Amazon's warehouse conditions for workers. According to internal data, Amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total non-serious minor injuries per 100 workers. The caveat to those numbers above is that the HELP Committee argues that Amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as \u201cnon-reportable\u201d because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care, even though they should have, and that the actual number of OSHA reported injuries should be significantly higher.\n___\n**Depop**, a peer-to-peer fashion-focused social commerce platform owned by **Etsy**, is eliminating seller fees for users in the US and shifting them to buyers, who will now pay up to 5% of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to $1.00. Previously sellers paid a 10% fee on every sale. Now they will pay a 3.3% + 45 cent payment processing fee (seems high) on the total amount including shipping and tax. Buyers will see the 5% + up to $1 fee at checkout, and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together.\n___\n**The U.S. Postal Service** was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with **Meta**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Pinterest**, and **Snap**, according to research by TechCrunch. Testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customer\u2019s address from the Informed Delivery landing page after customers logged in, and then sending it to the tech companies. Informed Delivery, is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives. The pixels also collected other data, such as information about the user\u2019s computer type and browser, their live location, and tracking numbers entered into the USPS website. It's not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long, however, Informed Delivery boasts more than 62M users as of March 2024, so most likely a large portion of those customers.\n___\n**Meta** is in talks to purchase a 5% stake in **EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands and owner of LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, EyeMed, and other eyewear retailers and medical providers, in a deal that could be worth about $4.73B based on the company's latest market value of $94.6B. The deal would give Meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses, just in time for its third-generation of glasses, which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season. EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said that the new generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, launched last October, have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years.\n___\n**TikTok** partnered with **Eventbrite**, integrating the company's event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform. The collaboration allows users to include Eventbrite links into their videos, which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app. TikTok says the alliance lets any TikTok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged. For example, a #BookTok creator can organize a book club meeting, a #FoodTok creator can host a cooking class, or a #NewMusic creator can book tickets to a local concert.\n___\n**TikTok** also partnered with **DistroKid**, a digital music distribution service that musicians use to put music into online stores and streaming services, to make it easier for independent musicians to build a presence in the app. Artists using DistroKid will be able to quickly create TikTok profiles that include artist-specific features like a Music Tab, New Releases, By Artist, Behind the Song, Fan Spotlight, Ticketing, and more.\n___\n**Cash App**, the mobile payment app owned by Block, is exiting the UK market, with plans to close down the app on September 15th. The UK was the first international market to receive the peer-to-peer payments app outside of the US when it was introduced in 2018, but now Block says that it's revising its approach to focus on growing within the US instead of continuing to expand into new markets. It's strange though to call the UK a \u201cnew market,\u201d given that the company launched in the region 6 years ago, while only having launched in the US in 2013. Cash App has been part of UK for more than half its existence. I wouldn't necessarily call that new.\n___\nA new class action lawsuit against **Temu** alleges that the company violates the United States' do-not-call registry status when sharing promotions. Phyllis King, a Delaware resident, filed the lawsuit on July 3rd, claiming that despite her status on the federal do-not-call registry, Temu texted her directly four times in April. King claims she did not provide Temu with consent to contact her, nor did she provide the company with her phone number. She also added that she lacks interest in Temu\u2019s products \u2014 which doesn't at all seem relevant to the case at hand, but good to know I guess, Phyllis.\n___\n**94% of retail executives**\u00a0plan to\u00a0increase their investments\u00a0into e-commerce over the next 6-12 months, according to a survey from Pattern. The survey revealed execs plan to increase their investments by an average of 16%, with 25% of brand leaders reporting an increase of 31-98%. Only 6% indicated that they planned to decrease their overall e-commerce investment during the same period.\n___\n**Squarespace CMO Kinjil Mathur**\u00a0is taking heat for saying that\u00a0Gen Zers need to ditch their list of demands\u00a0for prospective employers and start hustling, including being \u201cwilling to do whatever it takes\u201d and \u201cwilling to work for free.\u201d Various online communities and subreddits were quick to point out that the executive's privileged background allowed her to focus on experience over a paycheck in her early working years, which is a luxury that isn't available to the working class or their college-aged children.\u00a0\n___\n**Beyond, Inc,**\u00a0owner of Overstock.com, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Zulily,\u00a0announced Overstock.com's grand reopening\u00a0featuring a new website look and feel and an inventory lineup that includes closeouts, liquidation, factory direct, and reverse logistics merchandise. Marcus Lemonis, the company's executive chairman, outlined his plans to establish partnerships and joint ventures with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and lenders to create product and deal flow. Sounds like Overstock wants to become the Temu of USA, before Temu becomes the Temu of USA.\n___\n**JPMorgan Chase**\u00a0is\u00a0blocking consumers\u00a0from using credit cards to pay for BNPL loans from third parties like Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay, effective October 10th. Richard Crone, a payments consultant, justified the move by noting that, \u201cYou can't pay for a credit card with a credit card.\u201d But then again, Richard, you can oftentimes do a 12-month interest-free balance transfer from one credit card to another, so there's that. It's predicted that other banks are expected to follow suit, given that many, like JPMorgan Chase, are launching their own card-linked BNPL services.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0getting more serious\u00a0about its return-to-office mandate and hosting one-on-one chats with employees who haven't spent enough time in the office. Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement, \u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues.\u201d CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer, \u201cIf you can't disagree and commit, it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0rolling out\u00a0Reels overlay ads on Instagram, which are banners that appear on screen with a large CTA prompt as either single image or carousel promotions. The new Reels overlay ads are being rolled out to advertisers over time, so while you might not have them yet, they are coming.\u00a0\n___\n**Dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals**\u00a0were found in items\u00a0ordered from\u00a0**Temu**\u00a0by Channel 4 reporter Ellie Flynn. Though no legislation currently regulates the amount of antimony in clothing, the heavy metal can have very bad effects on the body, particularly with the nervous system. Temu's supplier code of conduct requires that sellers \u201cnever bring products or packaging to market that may cause harm to Temu's customers.\u201d Temu confirmed Channel 4's findings, permanently removed the items in question, and said that it's working with the merchants involved.\u00a0\n___\n**Laybuy**, a New Zealand-based BNPL firm, has\u00a0gone into administration\u00a0after becoming insolvent. A notice on the website reads, \u201cPayment services are currently suspended across all regions\u2026 During this time, all existing orders will be processed as normal.\u201d Laybuy had disabled its website in mid-June, which led to suspicion that the company would be ceasing operations, and now the news of its collapse has been confirmed.\n___\n**Wix**\u00a0has been\u00a0ordered to pay \u20ac35k\u00a0in compensation to the former Irish employee who was fired after she labeled Israel a \u201cterrorist state\u201d on social media. Wix accepted that it had unfairly dismissed customer care team lead Courtney Carey in Oct 2023 for gross misconduct over online comments she had made about her concerns over the situation in Palestine. Either that, or the company simply decided that it was cheaper to pay the \u20ac35k than continue battling Carey in court.\u00a0\n___\n**ByteDance**\u00a0qualifies as a gatekeeper\u00a0under the Digital Markets Act, according to the General Court of the EU, which subjects the company to stricter regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and user rights. The Commission assigned ByteDance gatekeeper status in Sep 2023, which ByteDance challenged by arguing that their effect on the European internal market was limited, but the General Court ultimately ruled that the company's significant market influence and substantial user base position it as a critical player in the digital market.\n___\n**E-commerce sales**\u00a0were up 8% YoY in June, driven by strong performance in the grocery and general merchandise categories, according to the latest Signifyd E-commerce Pulse data. According to Signifyd, a decline in prices likely contributed to increased sales in general merchandise, which was up 30% YoY last month.\n___\n**Teenagers are accessing TikTok Shop**\u00a0via a loophole in the platform, despite the platform restricting shopping to users who are 18 and older. The issue occurs when a teen originally lies about their age when signing up for TIkTok, but then is later required by a parent to pair the account with theirs using TikTok's built-in parental controls. Despite the pairing process, the teen still has access to the Shop feature. Wait a minute, are you telling me that teenagers lie about their age on TikTok? Color me surprised!\n___\n**H Mart**, an Asian supermarket chain that serves the US,\u00a0launched a new online store\u00a0and expanded its delivery offering in partnership with Uber Eats. The company is leveraging the VTEX platform for e-commrce, which allows customers to order both shelf-stable and fresh products in the same cart, while accessing store inventory to provide real-time available info on products. VTEX also includes a pick and pack app, which the company uses to enable in-store picking of products for online orders.\n___\n**The Nigerian government**\u00a0is planning to\u00a0regulate e-commerce platforms\u00a0and introduce cyber insurance for consumers, as part of its new National Digital Economy and E-Governance Bill currently under review. The bill would require e-commerce platforms to provide clear and accurate information about sellers, goods, services, and transaction terms including payment methods, returns, and refund policies, as well as create a legal framework to accelerate Nigeria's digital economy.\n___\n**In other Nigerian news**, the government\u00a0fined Meta $220M\u00a0for WhatsApp violating the country's data and privacy laws. The violations include appropriating personal data without consent, abuse of dominant market position by forcing \u201cunscrupulous, exploitative and non-compliant privacy policies,\u201d and sharing personal data without consent. Meta says it disagrees with the decision and the fine and will appeal.\u00a0\n___\n**Kevin Scott**, chief technology officer at Microsoft, is\u00a0joining Shopify's board. Shopify wrote in their announcement, \u201cKevin\u2019s no stranger to the art of innovation. He\u2019s built an engineering culture at Microsoft focused on making AI more accessible, and developing tools that help people tackle previously unsolvable problems. An incredible asset for Shopify and our merchants.\u201d\n___\n**ReBound**, a global returns management specialist,\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**Loop**, a returns technology platform, to streamline retailers' returns processes by integrating advanced logistics and returns management with an easy to use technology platform. Loop integrates with Shopify and currently represents 15% of the total GMV sold on the platform, while ReBound handles more than 100M return transactions annually for global brands. Last month I\u00a0[reported](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/new-e-commerce-rules-in-china-india-california\/?)\u00a0that Loop made Happy Returns its preferred returns portal partner for Shopify brands, as well as their recommended partner for in-person box-free, label-free returns.\n___\n**Macy's**\u00a0board of directors\u00a0voted unanimously\u00a0to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who were attempting to acquire the company, and instead pursue its own turnaround strategy to remake the department store chain by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and subsequently spin off its real estate assets or separate its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0restocked and sold\u00a0a used poop-stained washable swim diaper that had gotten returned to an FBA brand named Beau & Belle Little, resulting in a 1-star review that sent the company into a fast downward spiral over the next four years as a result of Amazon's algorithm amplifying the review and accompanying photo. Even though Amazon's policy is to remove reviews relating to packaging, shipping problems, product condition, or damage, the brand's e-mails and requests to remove the review went unanswered for four years. Amazon finally removed the review after Bloomberg ran a story on it last week, but at this point, the once successful brand has collapsed, and the owners are having to work outside jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0says it\u00a0won't be launching\u00a0its upcoming multimodal AI model that's capable of handling video, audio, images, and text in the European Union, citing regulatory concerns. The decision follows the passing of the EU's new AI Act, which requires AI companies to comply with copyright, transparency, and predictive policing policies by Aug 2026, and will prevent EU companies from using the model, despite it being released under an open license.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0also said it would be\u00a0pausing the use\u00a0of its gen-AI tools in Brazil due to opposition from the country's government over its privacy policy on personal data and AI. Meta was banned from training its AI models on Brazilians' personal data by the country's National Data Protection Authority earlier this month.\n___\nAnd speaking of\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0cutting back, the company is planning to\u00a0cut the budget\u00a0for its Reality Labs hardware division, which makes its VR headsets, by about 20% between now and 2026, in a move meant to put the division's out of control spending under lock. Bank of America estimated that Meta could save around $3B, which could be reallocated to its AI efforts \u2014 just not in the EU or Brazil apparently.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0surpassed Tokopedia\u00a0to become the second-largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, according to a Momentum Works report. Shopee stills maintains its dominant position with a GMV of $55.1B, owning 48% of SEA's market share. However while Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia all reduced their workforces during the past two years, TikTok Shop has expanded its workforce to over 8,000 employees since Dec 2021.\n___\n**Flipkart**\u00a0is\u00a0trialing a quick-commerce service\u00a0called Flipkart Minutes among its employees in Bengaluru, with plans to offer it to a wider base of consumers in the next few weeks. The service seeks to instantly deliver electronics, groceries, and other products, competing in India with Blinkin, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, which all fulfill orders in less than 30 minutes.\n___\n**Sezzle**\u00a0added Spanish language capability\u00a0to its BNPL app and checkout, as a means to appeal to the 40M Americans who speak Spanish. Last week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that Ikea added Spanish to its online shopping experience and phone support. Where have these companies been? Are they just now discovering that people speak Spanish in the US?\n___\nPlus 7 other seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lineage**, a cold storage real estate investment trust backed by private equity firm Bay Grove Capital, seeking to raise $3.85B in an upcoming IPO.\n___\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

Hey everyone,\n\nI've recently moved to Jaipur and have been on the lookout for fresh strawberries.

TLDR: Frustrated of being defrauded by Swiggy Instamart of substandard and underweight produce. Their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices. will a consumer courts complaint help me get what I paid for?\n\nFeel cheated every time I order from Swiggy Instamart for the sake of convivence, Mutiple times They have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce, supplied to them on their store by third party vendors. Moreover, they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat. they ask you to email them proofs (to save server costs) and when supported by photo\/video evidence they dismiss the issue by stating, they are unable to \" validate\" my claims and refuse to replace even, forget refunding.  \n\n\nEvery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items, where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up.   \nHow is it that I have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check, it's like i am paying to give my feedback every time. Nothing changes and they continue on their merry way.    \n\n\nI am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if I am luck. I understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks, but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense.   \n\n\nA simple transaction of getting what I paid for as consumer shouldn't be such a gamble, Swiggy Instamart feels like a micro-gambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to \"the (un) concerned team\" and a take home a promise to of it being \" never repeated again in the future\".  \n\n\nI have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months.   On principle, i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company.  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers, it not a small amount. I wish we had class action lawsuits in our country.   \n1. Is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on National Consumer helpline portal online?  \n2. will my emails to Swiggy's Customer care team be considered as a legal notice, wherein I've mentioned it to be considered as such?","45":"Today\u2019s Headlines \u201cGod bless your day with much happiness, joy and love.\nHave a peaceful Day.\u201d\nVery Good Morning \ud83e\udeb4\n\nToday's Headlines from :\n\n*Economic Times*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd \"Another milestone\": ISRO rocket accomplishes zero orbital debris mission\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Novo Nordisk to buy Cardior Pharma for up to $1 billion\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Nissan targets 1 million car sales growth over next three years\n\n\ud83d\udcdd India plans to shift from minimum wage to living wage by 2025\n\n\ud83d\udcdd RBL Bank aims to grow retail with new products, cut back on wholesale book\n\n\ud83d\udcdd IRDAI retains existing surrender value norms after pushback from industry\n\n\ud83d\udcdd NCLT rejects promoter\u2019s resolution plan in Wadhwa Buildcon insolvency matter\n\n*Business Standard*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Space World plans to connect data centres in 7 major cities in a year\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Jindal Stainless collaborates with IIT-Kharagpur for metallurgical projects\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Google Play billing system comes under RBI scanner over alleged violations\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Co-working spaces set to expand capacity in 12-24 months as demand rises\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Mahindra Lifespace to invest Rs 6,000 crore in residential business by FY28\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Bank direct lending to NBFCs to moderate at Rs 1.7-1.9 trn in FY25: ICRA\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Hong Kong regains fourth-largest market spot after rout in Indian equities\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Fundraising through SME IPOs hit a new high in FY24, Rs 5,579 crore raised\n\n*Financial Express*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Discoms improve renewable energy purchase compliance\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Unilever, ReNew get WEF support for Industry 4.0\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Ministries seek more socioeconomic surveys; several requests made to statistics ministry for tech, manpower support\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Govt begins probe into \u2018dumping\u2019\u00a0of foil imports\n\n*Mint*\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Amul to debut in fresh milk export, launch four variants in US within a week\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Oil prices rise on heightened supply concerns, brent crude at $86.48\/bbl\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Zepto report 'all-time high orders' on Holi 2024\n\n\ud83d\udcdd EU launches probes into Apple, Meta, Google under new digital competition law\n\n\ud83d\udcdd China rolls out welcome mat for US CEOs as it nods to its economic problems\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Airtel preparing for tariff hike, Jio to focus on greater data usage: Report\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Fed\u2019s Powell hints at rate cuts if unemployment rises, despite inflation concern.","46":"No Instamart service in mannanthala-mukkolakkal side.. but why? bought a new flat in mannanthala-mukkolakkal side, but found out that swiggy instamart service not available there.

The hub is located in jayanagar KR road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi, Jayanagar, NR colony, srinagar, gavipuram , Banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nIf you're ordering during heavy rains, please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged, then it falls on the delivery persons head. Please use UPI during pay on delivery.\n\nIf your place has no lift, please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs( I've had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans )\n\nA lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money, its pathetic and please don't do that. The only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes aren't accepted through machines and we literally can't go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nMany people literally forget they've ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nPlease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly.\n(One instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number, when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that person's relative and then when i got to the door, i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment. All that person could've done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate)\nSo please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\nDogs, as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house. So please if you have dogs, please come near the gate and collect the order.\n\nAnd this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nPlease understand that the base pay (if the distance is less than 1kms) swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day. They're paid for the distance they ride, not the number of floors they climb.\n\nThis isn't me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective, this is me coming from a humanity perspective.\nThe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and there's no seating area for the riders, or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet.\nSo the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times.\n\nThese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners.

A delivery associate once asked for \\~\u20b9100 (the order was already paid online and was worth more than \u20b9100), and elders ended up giving it. Swiggy, somewhat understandably, didn\u2019t do anything about it. I haven\u2019t ordered on COD since. (to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not)\n2. A delivery associate stopped for fuel, food, and even \"servicing the vehicle\" (which turned out to be a residential complex) while on the way to deliver my order. It took them over an hour to deliver a 3-km order. I initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes. They told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver. A few minutes later, I reported it to Swiggy support, who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate, but it ended up taking another 40. When I later checked the location's screenshot on google maps, it turned out to be a residential place, not a \"garage\" as they claimed, likely a stop to eat. On their way from the house, they also stopped at a fuel station. In the end, no compensation was provided for the delay.\n\nMinor issues-\n\n* Torn packages, with food intact\n* Food tossed around inside the packaging (especially desserts)\n* Leaking food (happened only once)\n* Order will be delivered on an \"EV\" ;but delivered on a Splendor\n* Having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nRestaurants, however, have much more to improve on-\n\n* Ignoring common cooking instructions (e.g \"don\u2019t make spicy\", \"don\u2019t add curry leaves\", etc)\n* Delivering incorrect items, including missing customized add-ons (e.g sour cream for tacos) or ingredients listed for the dish (e.g, no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed). For the second instance (no veggies...) no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability.\n* Sending bad items (e.g., burnt, stale, cold, or poorly presented food) while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether.\n* Taking many minutes to accept an order- a new scam on Swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the on-time guarantee (e.g., if the guarantee is 20 minutes, a 15-minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes, as the timer starts only after acceptance, zeroing their liability for delays).\n* Reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price, some joins have extreme markups for online platforms.\n* Excessive packaging charges (e.g., \u20b930-100 on a \u20b9200 order), making discounts pointless at some joints\n* Adding GST on top of GST-inclusive items\n* Providing less quantity than advertised (e.g., 300g listed, but 220g delivered, including packaging; the aggregator (Swiggy\/Zomato) usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported)\n* Misleading pictures that don\u2019t represent the delivered product (one of the earliest \"scams\")\n* Improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy (some people reportedly get refunds for this, but I\u2019ve never tried)\n* Cancelled orders due to \"unavailable items\", which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time (an hour in my case, but made available without the offers), yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts.\n\nDiscount inconsistencies-\n\n* Discounts from some restaurants vary wildly, e.g 60% off most days, but only 30% or lower on random days. This seems to balance ordering, ratings, and revenue. If unaware; people recommend such joints to friends, who then order with significantly worse discounts.\n* A few restaurants with good reviews seem to \"pump and dump,\" offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days, later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews. New\/ uninformed customers, unaware of prior discounts, continue ordering; although in smaller numbers than previously, but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings.\n\nBonus-  \nI\u2019ve had three instances where the order was marked as \"arrived at location\" much earlier than it was actually delivered on Swiggy. In all three cases, I was asked to provide an OTP. I\u2019m curious what this means for delivery guarantees; does it count as \"arrived at location\" for those even if the driver is far from the location?\n\nI almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays.

I had discovered them through Cred, which used to feature insane discounts on their products then. They were selling only on Amazon then, apart from Cred. Their shark tank appearance gave them a massive boost in popularity and they were now everywhere from instamart and zepto to even my office vending machine. They even had clicked stars as their brand ambassadors. And now, in the last few months, I have observed that they have disappeared. They are neither available on instamart or blinkit and I haven't seen them in any brick and mortar retail store either. So what happened to them? They seemed very promising then.","72":"Swiggy Instamart sent used shaving cartridges! Ordered these via Instamart today and got an opened pack and used cartridges.

When I raised this issue with Swiggy, they claimed they couldn't validate my claim and refused to refund the money (I still have the chocolate with me). Despite bringing this up on X, they insisted they cant do anything. How is it fair that we have to pay for expired products while they get away with it? What are my options here?","76":"Any review on this?? Priced at 500 something on swiggy instamart \nIs this product worth buying for?? ","77":"Looking for credit card(s) suggestions My family has no history or interest in using credit cards so I don't know much about them. Using them as loan service is not what i am looking for. My purpose is to find cards that can give cashback or similar rewards.\n\nHere's more about me-\n\n- 25M, earning 17LPA. My salary account is with canara bank simply because it's at walking distance from my house. Will I lose out on much by not switching it to a different bank?\n\n- Not a big spender at all, i live with parents and save majority of my money. My monthly expenses are about 15-20k unless I buy some expensive piece of tech or some computer parts\n\n- The above mentioned gadgets and tech stuff is usually bought from third party local vendors who know their products and customers. Basically I don't order much from Amazon, it's just stuff like hair trimmer, rechargable batteries etc. I'd say monthly i spend about 2k or less on Amazon so not sure if their card would make much sense for me. My dad orders on the behalf of his office friends so he has an active account on both Amazon and Flipkart but unfortunately he said no for either of their credit cards.\n\n- I buy expensive stuff like ANC headphones or high end phone from Croma, offline. Planning to buy a mirrorless camera from their store in future.\n\n- Not a traveller but I am planning to go on international trips once my friend gets settled properly. Domestic trips are extremely rare for me. Not exactly dying for lounge access but it'd be nice to have it ig?\n\n- I mostly use Swiggy, for both instamart and food deliveries. Recently tried Dineout and it seemed fine too. I'd say I spend around 6-7k monthly on Swiggy only. This made me consider getting the Swiggy HDFC card cause it showed there won't be any extra charges, basically what people here call LTF. Reason why I didn't get it yet is people here don't recommend getting a co branded card first. \n\n- I don't go out to to eat in restaraunts often, I'd say about once in 2 months.\n\n- Not really interested in buying stuff on EMI but i won't mind no cost EMI if there are additional discounts. (i don't know if that is the case generally or if the additional discounts are what give it the meaning \"no cost\")\n\n- I don't travel much within Delhi either. i do use Uber on occasions. My work is mostly WFH and even if i have to go to the office, we have transport provided by the office.\n\n- I am very sketchy of credit cards in general as they basically let you spend money that you don't have. Which means if it gets lost of stolen, someone can put me in massive debt. I also see posts of people finding out about loans against there account that they didn't apply for. idk how it happens but i'd definitely like to make sure my information is safe and i don't fall prey to such things.\n\n- I am not loyal to a brand like Apple or Samsung. I don't have any eco system and neither am i aiming to build one.\n\n- Don't have a car yet. Might own one in the future but again my fuel expenses won't be a lot.\n\n- Don't have any loans or pending EMI.\n\n- Don't have any netflix, prime or similar subscriptions. I rarely buy PC games. Mostly sail the high seas.\n\n- I occasionally buy clothes from HnM, Uniqlo and Myntraa.\n\n- My mother is really into buying gold stuff but I doubt if there's anything for that?\n\n- I personally don't use Airtel but my parents have a sim card each. They also use Airtel DTH. I read about Airtel Axis card so i can consider getting it and paying for my parent's bills.\n\n- I don't have experience of dealing with banks and stuff. as of now, i don't even know how to get a credit card. Is it just an online process? Do I need to visit bank? Do i need to call bank? I'd prefer to avoid frequent bank visits and getting on calls.\n\n- I don't know much about credit score, or limit and all that stuff.\n\nIn the end, i only want to use credit cards like my debit card while optimizing cashback rewards. Swiggy HDFC card showed that i'd get about 7-8k cashback per year based on how much i spend on swiggy monthly and that's pretty much what made me consider having one and get to know more about this rabit hole.\n\nI'd be really grateful for good recommendations.","78":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Sep 2nd, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants, raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","79":"How is this? Has anyone tried? https:\/\/www.omayfoods.com\/products\/solid-soyabean-protein-rich-1?variant=45394704466140.\n\nSeems very economical 100g has 46gms of protein. And one box of 160g is 90rs on instamart. Seems like a good option for vegetarians on budget.","80":"Fast and Up company's NAC\/Glutathione supplements are popular in Kerala. They conceal the presence of two ingredients in with the help of a white sticker. [Relevance to Kerala in first paragraph] Fast & Up is a very popular Indian supplements company. Its products are used by runners, athletes, women and men who think it will clear up their skin and make them fairer, people with respiratory problems (NAC dissolves mucus in your airways), addicts to various things including pron, drugs, smoking etc, and OCD and other mental disorders. Many sports groups in Kerala drink their effervescent tablets after matches.\n\nNAC\/Glutathione is definitely a good medicine. You can buy and order it online without prescription. But a popular company producing and selling it, including on Swiggy's Instamart, Fast & Up, is playing a dangerous game with our lives. Doctors say medicines should ideally be consumed as an oral tablet rather than an effervescent tablet. An effervescent tablet is kept in a glass and water is poured in. It bubbles up and after a couple of minutes we can drink it.\n\nI used to take their products and noticed that it had a couple of sweeteners. But since they were given in the form of numerical codes I didn't bother to google. Now they have started selling it with a white sticker covering the ingredients list. I removed it and found their names: **maltodextrin** and **dextrose.**\n\nMaltodextrin is a synthetic substance made from rice, corn and some other things. It can be GMO, in which case it should be avoided by people with digestive issues.  \n  \n**Diabetes**: It is highly processed and has a GI (glycemic index) higher than 100. Some websites report it as between 105 and 130. The glycemic index of table sugar is only 75. So not only is this unhealthy for diabetics but it also puts non diabetics at risk. It is absorbed into the blood stream at a rapid rate and this can potentially cause diabetes in the long term. \n\nLays chips and many of its competitors all use maltodextrin to enhance the flavour. If you take NAC tablets every day, you are spiking your blood levels once or twice a day, depending on your frequency. But if you eat a huge packet of Lays chips full of maltodextrin, then you will be spiking it much more. Almost everything we eat raises our blood sugar levels. But things like maltodextrin are very bad since they cause sudden spikes.\n\n**Obesity**: It is a simple carbohydrate and has no nutritional value. Therefore large doses can lead to obesity.\n\n**IBD and Bowel diseases**: Our intestine contains both good and bad bacteria. The good bacteria helps to maintain our mental health and keep our body in good condition. Maltodextrin kills off the good bacteria and increases the bad bacteria, leading to gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease. With IBD you will not be able to drink milk and several foods. You will also get bloody diarrhoea and constipation on a frequent basis. This is an incurable disease but you can put it in remission until it comes back again (flare-up).\n\nDoctors may also do colonoscopy. You will have to get naked and they will stick a device up your rectum and go deep into your intestine.\n\n>However, multiple recent studies have shown detrimental roles played by **maltodextrin in the intestinal environment, suggesting that this broadly used food additive may play a role in the rapid increased incidence of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome.** In this issue of\u00a0*Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology*, Laudisi et\u00a0al[^(1)](https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/#bib1)\u00a0add a new line to this list of evidences, with the investigation of the impact of maltodextrin on murine models of colitis. By using 2 different models of colitis, the investigators found that consumption of maltodextrin exacerbated intestinal inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, such detrimental effects of maltodextrin were linked to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent alterations of the protective mucus layer. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress was sufficient to prevent maltodextrin-induced intestinal inflammation and associated depletion in the mucus layer.[^(1)](https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/#bib1)\n\n[https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/](https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/)  \n\n\n**Gas, Diarrhoea, Bloating**: can be caused by high doses of maltodextrin. Avoid processed foods such as chips and nutrition bars. Many popular foods contain maltodextrin.\n\nSources: \n\n  \n[https:\/\/www.medicinenet.com\/what\\_is\\_maltodextrin\\_and\\_is\\_it\\_bad\\_for\\_you\/article.htm](https:\/\/www.medicinenet.com\/what_is_maltodextrin_and_is_it_bad_for_you\/article.htm)  \n  \n[https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/what-is-maltodextrin](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/what-is-maltodextrin)\n\n[https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/](https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC6409436\/)\n\n**Dextrose** is a very high glycemic index sweetener. It is also used as a preservative. Diabetics may keep a dextrose tablet with them so that if their blood sugar falls too low and they are about to faint, chewing the tablet will cause a huge increase in sugar levels. This is what Fast and Up includes in their products!\n\nYou are at increased risk of diabetes, obesity, and even heart and kidney disease. Due to the high sugar content, your kidneys will get stressed excreting them. It can also cause fatty liver disease and insulin resistance.\n\n[https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/what-to-know-dextrose](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/what-to-know-dextrose)\n\nMaybe an athlete will need these sweeteners to increase their energy levels drastically and therefore it is suitable for them. But many people with sedentary lifestyles such as elderly respiratory disease patients and children definitely don't need it.   \n  \nThey can buy NAC\/Glutathione tablets in tablet form only, not effervescent tablet. It won't be sweet and it actually smells like shit. But you don't need to bite it, just swallow it with a glass of water and you are good to go. It will detoxify your lungs and liver and make your life better. And that's because those tablets don't have maltodextrin and dextrose.","81":"Please rate my High level design for Instamart\/Zepto\/Blinkit Hi Guys, I'm practicing for System Design Interviews and created a HLD for Instamart\/Blinkit. Please review it and suggest some points. I'm open for a feedback.

A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","82":"Created an app in which you can compare prices between multiple platforms like instamart, blinkit etc.  \n\nHi guys, I created an app [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) where you can compare prices of multiple products available on platforms like Instamart, Blinkit, Bigbasket Zepto.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n___\n\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce, emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against ReviewServiceUSA.com for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate Alibaba.com, the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see. The feature is not yet available to most users, and it's unclear if it will only be available to Premium users. While reducing spam is good, Fortune comments that it could also prevent the free flow of information, as people often backup their points with legitimate data sources.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0is looking to\u00a0compete against\u00a0Shein and Temu by offering shipment subsidies to certain sellers on Tmall and Taobao, enabling them to sell their goods directly to customers in several countries outside of China. Alibaba will manage the cross-border logistics, and qualified merchants will only need to transport requested items to a designated consolidation warehouse in China.\u00a0\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian food delivery and quick commerce startup, is\u00a0pivoting\u00a0its Shopify alternative, Swiggy Minis, into a link-in-bio service, similar to LinkTree, with the intention of catering to service providers like nutritionists and fitness trainers. The Swiggy Minis service will now act as a landing page that sellers can point their target customers to from their social media pages.\n___\nIn other\u00a0**Swiggy**\u00a0news,\u00a0**Amazon India**\u00a0is rumored to have\u00a0approached the company\u00a0for a potential deal to buy a stake in its quick commerce business, Instamart, prior to Swiggy's IPO. There's currently no official offer on the table yet, but Amazon will need to move quickly for a chance of the talks going to the next stage.\n___\n**Jack Dorsey**\u00a0wrote a note\u00a0to Block employees this week announcing that the company is getting an overhaul to its internal reporting structure that will blow up the boundaries between various business lines, grouping employees together instead based on roles like engineering, design, and sales. Dorsey said that the move would take Block back to how it started as a company and is intended to address its three problems of \u201ccollaboration, craft, and flexibility.\u201d\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0set to be hit\u00a0with its first EU antitrust fine for tying its Marketplace service with its Facebook social network, which comes a year and a half after the EU accused Meta of giving its classified ads service an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together. The EU competition watchdog said that Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. Meta could face a fine of as much as $13.4B, or 10% of its 2023 global revenue.\u00a0\n___\n**In other Meta vs EU news\u2026**\u00a0Meta\u00a0has been given\u00a0until September 1st to respond to consumer protection concerns in the EU over the binary \u201cpay or consent\u201d choice it gave users last November. If Meta does not take the necessary steps to solve the concerns raised by the EU by proposing solutions, authorities can decide to take enforcement measures, including sanctions.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0received a \u00a31.87M fine\u00a0by the UK for failing to provide Ofcom (the UK's regulatory and competition authority) with accurate information about its parental controls, disrupting the publication of its child safety transparency report. Firms are required by law in the country to respond to all statutory information requests from Ofcom in a timely manner. The information was supposed to inform a planned report highlighting the safety measures they have in place to protect children from harmful content.\n___\n**X**\u00a0turned on\u00a0an AI opt-out setting, which indicates that it intends to use millions of users' posts and interactions to train Grok, its AI assistant being developed by another one of Elon Musk's companies. Users can opt out of having their data collected by Grok, and there's also an option to delete your Grok conversation history.\n___\n**Dialpad**, a business communications service provider,\u00a0released\u00a0a new version of its AI Sales platform, which leverages more than 6B minutes of business conversations to coach sellers better through the sales process. AI Sales eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools to deliver intelligence to sellers such as how to handle objections and accurately position their solutions against the competition. Someone should make an AI Buyers platform that argues with Dialpad's AI Sales to get the best deal.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing\u00a0a hands-off way for marketers to include all available offers listed on their site into their ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram. The company's new ad setup process automatically detects offers based on the URL entered for the ad campaign, and then automatically showcases any discounts and promotional codes embedded in the site.\n___\n**Amazon's AI-powered paid version of Alexa**\u00a0that is rumored to cost up to $10\/month\u00a0could arrive\u00a0in the next few weeks, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. An employee who works on the Alexa team told the WSJ that the division is racing toward the deadline to launch the subscription even though \u201cthe technology isn't there.\u201d\u00a0\n___\n**Three out of five Americans**\u00a0think the US is in a recession, according to a\u00a0recent survey\u00a0by Affirm, with respondents indicating that the downturn started in March 2023. However, technically, no recession has taken place, according to the traditional definition which requires that GDP would need to fall for two successive quarters for this to happen. So does that just indicate that inflation has been outpacing the recession by boosting GDP?\n___\nPlus 8 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Cohere**, a Toronto-based enterprise-focused generative AI startup co-founded by ex-Google researchers, raising $500M in its Series D round.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","86":"Which product you were already using, before they came on Shark Tank India for a pitch? I was already a customer of the following products before they came on Shark Tank. Most of them were one time purchase.\n\n1. Rare Planet: Bought a gift for someone while waiting at an Airport. As expected, way more costly for the product because they are at an Airport.\n\n2. Shades of Spring: Used their subscription a couple of times for gifting flowers to my wife. Nice concept of a DIY flower kit. After a couple of Instagram posts, the novelty wore off and never ordered again. Just buying a flower locally at 10% of their price works well.\n\n3. Green Protein: Plant protien tastes worse and makes you pukish. Learned this after buying from Green Protein. Still have some expired packets hidden somewhere in my kitchen.\n\n4. Inside FPV: I am a drone\/RC plane enthusiast. Bought a couple of items from their online store few times.\n\n5. Makino: Bought one time from a supermarket. Average taste and costly.\n\n6. Wol3D. I have a 3d printer hobby. I build and fly 3d printed RC planes too. Bought filaments from them a couple of times. I am a regular customer (as in once every 2-3 months).\n\n7. Kitsons: Bought from their stores a few times when I was living in Hyderabad 10 years ago.\n\n8. Wicked Gud: I like instant noodles, and keep trying different brands. Bought them twice from Instamart before moving on to the next brand.\n\n9. Quirksmith: Wife buys occasionally from them.\n\n10. Odd Giraffe: Bought their journal last year in January as a part of new year resolution. Used it for 1-2 weeks, then lying idle. New Habits are hard to form.","87":"Community Roundup: List of must read posts & interesting discussions that happened in September 2024 ## Announcements\n|Announcements from volunteer team|\n|--------|\n| [**We are excited to announce our partnership with Drupalers Association Pune for DrupalCamp Pune 2024.

Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 39% of consumers in the US return an online item at least once a month, according to a recent survey by Narvar. In 2023, consumers returned over $744B worth of merchandise.\n___\nAt its annual \u201cLet's Grow! 2024 Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit\u201d last week, **Walmart** announced category expansions and new features that the company believes will simplify selling for e-commerce merchants. Highlights include a resale marketplace for third party sellers to list used items, multi channel fulfillment where merchants can use WFS to fulfill orders from any e-commerce website via Walmart's supply chain, a collector shop, a premium beauty shop, and more. See my comment at the bottom of this post where I break down Walmart's new capabilities in detail. \n___\n**Google** unveiled new updates for **businesses** using its Google Merchant Center aimed at making it easier for merchant's to access reports and obtain insights. Updates for sellers include new product trend insights that highlight key shopping search and purchase trends, more AI elements in Merchant Center including summaries of recent product performance, and the ability to request custom reports using conversational queries. I could use that last feature in GA4!\n___\n**Google** also added new AI Chrome features aimed at helping **buyers** search, discover, and compare products across the web. Updates for buyers include tab compare, which uses AI and page scraping to round up information about products open in various tabs and then display a grid showing their price, reviews, and other info, visual search, which brings capabilities from Google Lens to desktop browsers, and ehnahced history, which lets users access their history with conversational queries like \"What was the ice-cream shop I looked at last week?\" or \"What coconut opener was I looking at on Amazon?\"\n___\n**Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski** said that he plans to reduce the company's workforce by half because the company can \u201cdo much more with less\u201d through AI. Klarna currently employees around 4,000 workers. This isn't the first time I've reported that Siemiatkowski has taken heat for his comments involving replacing human staff with AI. In May, Siemiatkowski posted on X that the company saved millions by using AI to cut costs and do the marketing work human employees previously did. In March, Siemiatkowski shared that within one month, Klarna's AI-powered assistant had handled two-thirds of customer service inquiries and is \u201cdoing the equivalent work of 700 full time agents.\u201d In December 2023, Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph that Klarna has elected to not hire any new employees outside of its engineering department because he believes AI can automate many tasks.\n___\nIn a pitch deck to prospective customers, one of Facebook's alleged marketing partners revealed how it listens to users via the microphones on their smartphones and advertises to them accordingly. According to 404 Media reports based on documents leaked to its reporters, **Cox Media Group** claims that its \u201cActive Listening\u201d software uses AI to \u201ccapture real-time intent data by listening to our conversations.\u201d The deck later says, \u201cAdvertisers can pair this voice-data with behavioral data to target in-market consumers.\u201d Cox Media Group counted **Facebook**, **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Bing** as clients of its \u201cActive Listening\u201d service.\n___\nAmazon is preparing to introduce its quick commerce services in India by the first quarter of next year in an attempt to rival Flipkart, which has already started testing its \u201cMinutes\u201d service in select regions of the country. An insider told The Economic Times, \u201cThe action in quick commerce just can\u2019t be ignored any more. The work has been in motion for some time, but now, there is clarity and a timeline.\u201d Another insider confirmed the plan, saying that Amazon has been working on the project internally. Currently the company is waiting for approvals from its global headquarters, as this would be Amazon's first quick service offering worldwide.\n___\n**PDD Holdings**, owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is reportedly sitting on $38B in cash, marking the largest cash position of any listed company that doesn't pay dividends or buy back shares. PDD's cash stockpile is more than twice the size of its closest contender, Tesla. The FT reported that most of the world's largest companies pay dividends or buy back shares. Out of the 151 companies on MSCI's Investable Market Index with more than $5B of net cash on their balance sheets, just five of them do not pay dividends or buy back stock \u2014 PDD, Tesla, Li Auto, Adyen, and Vernova. Last week, PDD Holdings released quarterly earnings showing an 86% jump in revenue and a 156% increase in profits, but ruled out investor payouts, which sent the stock tumbling by 31%. The stock price drop lost the company $50B in market value, knocking founder Colin Huang off his pedestal as the wealthiest person in China, just weeks after earning the title.\n___\n**BigCommerce** released its Next Big Thing \u2013 Aug 2024 edition, a twice-yearly recap of new platform updates, partner integrations, and features. Some of these you've seen me cover in previous editions and others were announced for the first time. Highlights include an AI-Integrated B2B quote workflow, an instant commerce offering that enables same-day BOPIS and local deliveries, new integrations with Shein, Amazon, and TikTok, and AI copywriter and product recommendations powered by Google. \n___\nWhen **Elon Musk** bought **Twitter** in 2022, although he covered the lion's share of the $44B purchase price, he also relied on bank loans and investors to cover the difference. The Washington Post reported how much other investors contributed vs how much their investments are worth today. Elon's personal $33.5B commitment is now worth $9.38B. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's $1.89B investment is now worth $529.2M. Jack Dorsey and Larry Ellison's $1B investments are now worth $280M. The estimates are based on Fidelity's recent valuation of the company, which found X to be worth 72% less than when Musk acquired it. Of course that valuation was performed before X went dark in Brazil, its fourth-largest market (more on that below).\n___\nWhile X investors are losing billions,\u00a0**Nvidia employees are getting rich!**\u00a0And Meta and Google staff are\u00a0reportedly getting jealous\u00a0of their wealthy Nvidia peers in Silicon Valley. Fortune reports that on Blind, an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space, Nvidia employees are sharing their net worth, which is in the multi-millions. A user whose profile shows they work for Meta wrote, \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0is\u00a0reducing the number of free listings\u00a0for private sellers in the UK from 1,000 per month to 300 and eliminating the cash option for local pickups. eBay also told sellers that if their registered address was in the UK, it would charge an international fee when the delivery address for the item is outside the UK. Some sellers disagreed with eBay\u2019s designation of them as business sellers, expressing concern about the platform's ability to keep their sensitive information safe when requiring them to provide their National Insurance number (NINO).\n___\n**BNPL users in Southeast Asia**\u00a0found a loophole\u00a0to turn their BNPL credit into cash by paying for other people's utility bills and purchases with their BNPL account in exchange for cash (minus a fee). However the scheme is ripe for abuse, and many desperate consumers are finding themselves in the belly of a scam \u2014 making purchases for others, but not receiving the cash in return. Thailand\u2019s National Credit Bureau called on BNPL providers to improve controls to prevent misuse of the system to create informal loans, and the The Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau also issued a warning about BNPL scams.\n___\n**X**\u00a0went dark\u00a0for Brazil's 20M users on Friday after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension due to Elon Musk refusing to name a legal representative of the social network in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes demands that X needs a representative in the country to respond to government requests to suspend accounts found to be spreading fake news, but Elon Musk refused, on the grounds that anyone he appointed would be exposed to the possibility of arrest. Brazil is X's fourth-largest market and has become a key venue in the global debate between free speech and disinformation. The feud led to the freezing Starlink's bank accounts in Brazil this week.\n___\nExecutives from\u00a0**Automattic**\u00a0and\u00a0**Elementor**, along with developer community members like Joost de Valk,\u00a0held a webinar\u00a0to discuss the stagnation in WordPress growth and explore causes and potential solutions. The webinar, entitled\u00a0*\u201cIs WordPress\u2019 Market share Declining? And What Should Product Businesses Do About it?,\u201d*\u00a0was a frank discussion about what WordPress is doing right and wrong, and what can be done to increase the market share of new users that are choosing a web publishing platform.\n___\n**Shopify**\u00a0is\u00a0hiring Mikhail Parakhin, a former Microsoft executive, as its new CTO. Parakhin worked with Microsoft since 2019, most recently serving as its CEO of advertising and web services, with previous experience as the president of its web experiences team and corporate VP of technology. Shopify said that Parakhin is \u201cone of the finest machine learning crafters on the planet\u201d and that he will oversee its engineering and data organizations.\n___\n**Swiggy**, an Indian online food ordering and delivery company,\u00a0appointed\u00a0Amitesh Jha as head of Instamart, the company's quick commerce business, marking Instamart's third head in the previous year and a half. Jha formerly held the position of Senior Vice President at Flipkart. Swiggy is replacing heads at a\u00a0faster pace than Starbucks!\u00a0\n___\n**Cart.com**\u00a0appointed\u00a0Timocin Pervane as its CFO, tasked with focusing on driving financial execution and accountability and operational efficiency. (Does that mean layoffs?) Pervane previously served as CFO of Shopify Logistics and brings more than two decades of experience in software, logistics, and consulting to the company.\n___\n**Stripe**\u00a0promoted\u00a0Rahul Patil to CTO, who will be responsible for overseeing the company's global operations including its ledger, billing, and financial data platforms. Stripe's current CTO, David Singleton, is leaving the company to start a new venture.\u00a0\n___\n**Qoo10**, an e-commerce conglomerate that primarily operates in SEA,\u00a0laid off 80% of its workforce, keeping mostly senior management, citing challenging market conditions and the need to restructure its operations as the primary reason for downsizing. Last month I\u00a0reported that that the South Korean government created a $445M rescue package to bail out merchants on WeMakePrice and TMON \u2014 both owned by Qoo10 \u2014 who did not receive payments from the platforms. The companies filed for court receivership, and Qoo10's CEO apologized for the incidents and pledged to use his own assets to help compensate affected customers and vendors.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0hired Covariant's founders\u00a0\u2014 Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, and Rocky Duan \u2014 along with around 25% of the AI startup's employees, while signing a non-exclusive license to use Covariant's robotic foundation models. In August, the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0published an article\u00a0entitled\u00a0*\u201cThe New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,\u201d*\u00a0in which reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz shared examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms as a means to avoid regulatory scrutiny. This sounds like a classic example of that strategy in action.\u00a0\n___\n**Fiserv**\u00a0and\u00a0**PayPal**\u00a0are\u00a0partnering up\u00a0to offer the Fastlane by PayPal checkout experience to Fiserv's merchant clients. Fastlane is a new guest checkout experience that allows customers to make purchase using their saved payment info without having to log into their account on an e-commerce website. Last week I\u00a0reported that PayPal began offering the service to Adyen's enterprise and marketplace customers.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba Group**\u00a0completed\u00a0its three year mandated rectification period following a 2021 fine for monopolistic behavior, according to China's State Administration of Market Regulation. In 2021, the regulator slapped a record $2.75B fine on Alibaba for abusing its market position by forcing merchants on its platforms to not work with rival platforms, a strategy that Shein has also been accused of last year. Times have changed quickly in China in recent years, and it's almost hard to remember that Alibaba was once a monopoly in the country.\u00a0\n___\n**Threads users**\u00a0can now see likes and replies\u00a0from users on other networks, as the platform weaves itself deeper into the fediverse. The cross-service is now officially available to everyone, but will only affect accounts that have opted to enable fedverise sharing within the app.\n___\n**Affirm**\u00a0was hit with a class action suit\u00a0for allegedly failing to protect the personally identifiable information of its users from a cyberattack on its banking partner, Evolve Bank & Trust. According to the suit, Evolve confirmed on June 25th that it had been breached by a \u201cknown cybercriminal organization\u201d that published its clients' data on the dark web. Regulators had previously issued an enforcement action on Evolve for engaging in \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices.\u201d\n___\n**X's lawsuit against Media Matters**\u00a0is\u00a0headed to trial\u00a0next year following a judge's refusal to toss the lawsuit. In November 2023, Media Matters published research reports documenting ads on X from companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, and AT&T appearing alongside posts promoting hate speech, but X called foul, alleging that the account Media Matters used in its screenshots only followed major brands and racist trolls in an effort to stack the deck for its purposes. Now the courts will decide whether Media Matters presented the truth or manufactured images to depict a false typical X user experience.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon's upcoming revamped version of Alexa**\u00a0will\u00a0primarily utilize\u00a0Anthropic's Claude AI model, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon plans to charge between $5 and $10 per month for its new \u201cRemarkable\u201d version of Alexa, which will use generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \u201cClassic\u201d Alexa voice assistant for free. However the initial versions of the new Alexa that used Amazon's in-house AI software struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, so the company is turning to Claude, which performed better than its own models.\n___\n**Zip**, an Australian-based BNPL provider, is\u00a0looking to integrate\u00a0with\u00a0**Apple**\u00a0to deploy its BNPL service in the US. Zip partnered with Stripe last month in the US and is now looking for strategic partnerships with other payment providers and US retailers. Apple launched its own internal BNPL service called Apple Pay Later in March 2023, but shut it down a year later, and said at the time that it planned to offer installment options on its Apple Pay via other providers.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is introducing\u00a0a new Manage Topics feature in the US that gives users more control over what they see on their For You feed. The feature offers a slider for various topics such as Creative Arts, Current Affairs, and Dance that users can slide to adjust to see more or less of each type of content. It wasn't visible in the screenshots, but I'm curious if \u201cShopping Videos\u201d will have its own toggle or if watching those types of videos are just going to be a price you pay moving forward to use the app.\u00a0\n___\n**Seko Logistics**, an end-to-end global logistics provider that you might remember is\u00a0suing the US Customs and Border Protection after it suspended Seko and other customers brokers earlier this year, is partnering with **Loop Returns**, a posts-purchase platform, to handle e-commerce returns management for its clients. The partnership will allow Loop customers to execute cross-border returns with Seko handling all necessary documentation and logistics to reduce shipping costs, while Seko clients gain access to a more cost-effective returns management solution.\u00a0\n___\n**Uber**\u00a0**drivers**\u00a0**in Kenya**\u00a0are\u00a0ignoring the app\u00a0and charging their own rates, which are at least 50% higher than Uber's official fare. A rate card published by a Nairobi drivers' union has become the new fare standard as high gas prices in the country have eaten into drivers' earnings. A union rep told\u00a0*Rest of World*, \u201cWe tried to talk to Uber about adjusting the prices, but it was in vain, so we decided to take matters into our own hands to provoke them into discussing our terms and conditions.\u201d Why are they still using Uber? Build a local app with your own rates and keep all the revenue in your own country. Uber's technology is a commodity at this point. Market share is the only value.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**By Rotation**, a fashion sharing platform, for a limited time promotion that lets guests receive a complimentary outfit rental from its platform. The campaign will initially target UK guests traveling for destination weddings at specified locations, but the companies hope to expand to US customers soon.\n___\n**JD Global Sales**, the international e-commerce division of JD.com,\u00a0launched three new overseas shipping services\u00a0for customers in the USA, Japan, and Singapore \u2014 Air Express, Air Standard, and Sea Economical. The new services reduce the shipping costs to the US for orders under 1kg by 50%, with rates starting as low as $2.80. The company is also introducing regional free shipping services on qualifying orders for a selection of 400k SKUs.\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0being sued\u00a0by one of its content moderators in the UK who is alleging that disability discrimination and a toxic work environment caused her stress and pregnancy complications. Olivia Anton Altamirano worked on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0*Badness Project*, which was built to remove harmful content from the platform, and said she was given targets that were \u201cimpossible to meet\u201d and was discriminated against because she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0to buy geothermal power from\u00a0**Sage Geosystems**\u00a0to supply its US data centers, as it races to build out infrastructure to support its investments in AI. The first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 in a location east of the Rocky Mountains. The exact location has not been revealed.\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0and\u00a0**Spotify**\u00a0are\u00a0testing a new functionality\u00a0that allow Instagram users to continuously share the music they are listening to directly into the app's Notes feature, marking a notable expansion of users' current ability to share 30-second song clips. The feature, which was discovered by Alessandro Paluzzi who posted a screenshot on Threads, reads, \u201cContinuously share what you're listening to. You can stop sharing at any time.\u201d Next up\u2026 continuously share what you're viewing on Reddit! Or not\u2026\n___\n**Mountain Dew**\u00a0is\u00a0reimbursing five consumers' moving fees\u00a0for relocating to the Mountain Time Zone and for posting on TikTok how they plan to enjoy the outdoors, as well as providing free Mountain Dew for a year. The company is now claiming Mountain Time as its own with a multi-channel campaign that leverages geo-fencing to offer a free drink to registered user who crosses into the time zone. Great idea, but I still think Dave had the\u00a0best Mountain Dew campaign pitch\u00a0of all time\u2026\n___\nPlus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including\u00a0**Axio,** an India-based BNPL firm with 9M customers and 3k merchants**,** raising $20M from Amazon's Smbhav Venture Fund.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

I took the video and mailed it to them. first they said that they are not seeing any orders from my number or registration email. then I sent them the screenshots as proof of me using the same number and email to order the earbuds. now they are saying that they cannot replace or refund and the only thing that they can do is prevent such unforseen events from happening in the future. they are indirectly asking me to be content with the damaged product as they cannot refund or replace it.

","97":"IIM-C Interview Transcript Location: Mumbai\n\n96\/86.77\/8.82\n\n18 Months Work-Ex\n\nCS Background\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 Panelists (2M, 1F)\n\nF1: So, what have you heard about our panel?\n\nMe: I think everyone has had a good experience. Its been a bit math intensive, but overall everyone has had a good experience\n\nF1: Really? (Laughs) A good experience?\n\nMe: Well they have all come out smiling so I am assuming their experience has been good \n\nF1: (smiling) So what are your expectations?\n\nMe: Since I am the last candidate, I am hoping you take it easy on me (everyone laughs)\n\nM1: So how good is your math?\n\nMe: To be honest sir I have lost touch with math\n\nM2: (Pretends to be shocked) How will you survive in IIM-C then, we are very focused on math\n\nMe: Its not like I cannot do math sir, I have studied it at an engineering level, its just that I have lost touch with it because it wasn't in the curriculum post second year and I did not need it in my work.\n\nM1: What about CAT?\n\nMe: Sir I had a specific strategy for CAT. I wanted to maximise my strengths and so I focused on DILR and VARC. I backed whatever I knew in Math from 10th, 11th and 12th and it worked out for me\n\nF1: So AI is the latest buzzword. Can you explain what type of AI is ChatGPT?\n\nMe: Explained about Generative AI and how it works\n\nF1: Have you heard the term naturalness in AI?\n\nMe: No ma'am, but I can give it a shot (F1 motions me to go on). Naturalness is how similar to a human an AI can beg in its responses.\n\nF1: Do you know if there is a test for naturalness?\n\nMe: Is it something to do with the accuracy of the model?\n\nF1: No, but that's okay maybe you can go back and read about it. Can you tell me what is the difference between AI and AGI?\n\nMe: (no clue about it, blabbered about AGI being able to generate responses related to overall general awareness and AI making predictions instead of generating responses)\n\nF1: No, that's not it. Do you know the full-form of AGI?\n\nMe: Artificial Generative Intelligence? \n\nF1: No, Artificial General Intelligence\n\nM2: So I see you have done some courses here, can you tell me what is a stack and queue?\n\nMe: Explained about stack and queue data structures and the concepts of FIFO and LIFO\n\nM2: You have also done a course on Financial Statement Analysis. Do you know in inventory management the principle of LIFO is applied? Can you tell me why?\n\nMe: (blanking completely at this point) Pushing out newer batches to the consumer can extend their shelf life as it is not close to expiry\n\nM2: Then what happens to the earlier batches?\n\nMe: They are also pushed out to consumers but it's upto the retailer on how they choose to sell those products. (Gave an example of bread being closer to expiry being sent on Swiggy instamart)\n\nM2: Can you think of why changing from LIFO to FIFO inventory management system can cause auditor to raise concerns?\n\nMe: The auditor might not be satisfied with the quality of product being sent out since it might be close to expiry\n\nM2: Consumer is still getting the product. Can you think of something else?\n\nMe: Maybe some human error creeps in and there is a number mismatch?\n\nF1: So you have mentioned you are a voracious reader. Can you tell me what books you read?\n\nMe: (breathing easier now) My preferred genres are historical fiction and fantasy\n\nF1: Talk about your favourite books in historical fiction\n\nMe: (Spoke about Song of Achilles)\n\nF1: What about fantasy?\n\nMe: (Spoke about Throne of Glass)\n\nF1: In fantasy we have this term 'high fantasy', can you explain what that is?\n\nMe: (Explained what high fantasy is)\n\nM2: (interrupting) what does your name mean?\n\nMe: It means famous and its another name for Lord Vishnu\n\nM2: Can you tell me then 10 avatars of Vishnu?\n\nMe: (Only knew 3)\n\nM2: Only 3? That's it? Are you not interested in Indian mythology?\n\nMe: No sir, that's not the case, it's just that I Haven't gotten a chance to read much about it. I usually stick to Greek Mythology.\n\nM1: Can you tell some IIM-C alumnus who writes historical fiction?\n\nMe: (no idea again) I'm sorry sir, I am not aware. If I had to guess I would say Ramachandra Guha. I know he is a historian but not sure if he has written any fiction\n\nF1: (full panel is laughing at my answer) I think Mr Guha would feel very insulted if his work was characterised as historical fiction\n\nM2: So you have mentioned about football, can you tell me who is top of the Indian League?\n\nMe: I believe its Odisha sir\n\nM2: Can you tell me who their top scorer is or any front line?\n\nMe: Sorry sir I am not aware\n\nM2: You are not interested in Indian football?\n\nMe: I keep an eye on the standings sir but I don't follow it actively. I mostly watch European Football\n\nM2: Which club do you support?\n\nMe: Manchester United\n\nM2: Why has the aura of Manchester United gone down in recent years?\n\nMe: (Gave a detailed explanation of the problems with United)\n\nM1: Can you tell me how many marriage halls are required to cater to Mumbai?\n\nMe: (Gave them an approach and they interjected with some helpful prompts)\n\nM1: Okay that's all, you can go now\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall a pretty good conversational interview and good experience. Stumbled at the inventory management portion but I am hoping speaking about what I knew can cover up for it! :) ","98":"Don\u2019t judge the book by its cover \ud83d\ude1c As per Swiggy instamart under handpicked they sell zero maida food but unfortunately didn\u2019t check the listings \ud83e\udd23 most of the products they have is made of refined wheat flour (maida) ","99":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of July 29th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ShopifyeCommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past two years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...  \n___\n\n**OpenAI** introduced **SearchGPT**, a prototype of its new AI search tool that can access the Internet and provide fast answers (with sources) to your search questions. OpenAI stressed its commitment to publishers, which is a hot topic in the AI world right now. The company says that it is \u201ccommitted to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\u201d and hopes to \u201chelp users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\u201d SearchGPT aims to do this by \u201cprominently citing and linking\u201d to sources in searches with \u201cclear, in-line, named attribution and links\u201d for users to engage with.\n___\nIn a new report, **Grizzly Research** alleges that **Pinterest** may be misleading investors by doctoring its key performance metrics. The research firm alleges that Pinterest is buying fake traffic from bots and click farms, relying too heavily on paid referral traffic from Google, flooding the platform with ad spam to increase the ARPU. building low value users to inflate KPIs, and artificially inflating metrics to keep CEO Bill Ready's exercise price for his options above $19.96 per share. Grizzly\u2019s model values PINS stock between $5.28 and $16 per share. (It currently sits at $37.85 at the time of writing this.)\n___\n**Satellite data** shows a significant rise in pollution where e-commerce fulfillment centers are built, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. The study researched the locations of 150k large warehouses across the US and gathered data on nitrogen dioxide in 2021 from a European Space Agency satellite instrument that takes daily readings as it orbits around the planet. The study found that neighborhoods within 5 miles of warehouses saw a nearly 20% increase in levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\u2014a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act that has been linked to health issues including asthma, respiratory infections, and chronic lung disease.  \n\n___\n**Walmart** released its first annual Adaptive Retail Report, featuring results from a survey that examined consumer interest in technologies such as virtual try-ons and other commerce features. The four key trends highlighted in the report are: 1) Customers expect to be advised and guided through their shopping journeys with hyper-specific recommendations and ready to adapt offerings. 2) Eighty percent of shoppers make online purchases while also focused on another task such as social media, TV, or work. 3) Shoppers want online retailers to mirror the in-store experience, and vice-versa. 4) More than half of consumers are shopping for food either entirely online or using a mix of online and in-store shopping. \n___\n**WooCommerce** shared their roadmap for the future of WooCommerce (formerly Woo, formerly WooCommerce), emphasizing an improved line of communication with its developer ecosystem. The company highlighted 7 important areas for innovation including stronger communication with developers, upgraded documentation, improved REST API V3, improved feedback loop on extensibility, a commitment to a 100% block based future, a more streamlined onboarding process, and modern store customizations such as more WooCommerce-specific themes. \n___\n**TikTok** is planning to launch its in-app shopping platform, TikTok Shop, in Spain and Ireland as early as October, restarting a stalled campaign to expand its e-commerce business in Europe. The rollout will be smaller than previously envisioned plans, launching in just the two countries for now, but ByteDance insiders say the company has plans to bring TikTok Shop to other parts of Europe next year. If this news sounds familiar\u2026 TikTok had previously attempted to make a bigger push into Europe a couple years ago, with plans to branch from the UK in 2022, but scaled back that rollout due to internal conflicts, and hadn't made a push since.\n___\n**80 World Trade Organization countries** reached an agreement known as the **E-Commerce Joint Initiative**, which governs global e-commerce, but failed to bring the US on board. The agreement aims to make trade faster, cheaper, fairer, and more secure for businesses, workers, and consumers. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis posted on X, \u201cWe negotiated the first global rules on digital trade,\u201d which the EU hailed as \u201chistoric news\u201d and Britain as \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d The rules include requiring all participants to make customs documents and processes digital, recognizing e-documents and e-signatures, putting in place safeguards against fraudsters, seeking to limit spam and protect personal data, and offering support to least-developed countries. The US said that the new rules were an important step forward, but that they still fell short and more work was needed, including on wording about exceptions due to essential security interests.\n___\n**Nvidia's H100 GPU** is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000, and a handful of tech companies are hoarding these coveted chips to power their entrances into AI. Earlier this year, Meta said that it was aiming to have a stash of 350,000 chips, or around $7B -$14B worth. Elon Musk also needs H100s for X and xAI, and recently boasted that xAI's training cluster is made up of 100,000 H100s. Then there's Tesla, which is hoarding 85,000 chips valued between $1.7B \u2013 $3.4B. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly hoarding more than 20,000 of the GPUs, which it is renting out to AI startups in exchange for equity. OpenAI hasn't confirmed how many H100s they are sitting on, but The Information reports that the company rents a cluster of processors dedicated to training from Microsoft at a steep discount as part of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.\n___\n**Gen Z**\u00a0is promoting an\u00a0underconsumption trend, which involves only buying what you need and rejecting influencer marketing. Is that a trend? That's been my life. LOL. Creators who embrace the trend are sharing videos of minimal or secondhand clothing in their closets, a handful of beauty products on their counters, and no Stanley cups in their cupboards.\n___\n**Britain**\u00a0will soon\u00a0lay out new plans\u00a0to regulate BNPL firms and is looking to \u201cwork closely with all interested stakeholders\u201d on the matter. The government first set out plans to regulate the sector in 2021, but was followed with multiple delays to the roadmap possibly due to political instability mixed with lobbying from big BNPL firms.\n___\n**Southwest Airlines**\u00a0is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**TikTok creators**\u00a0in key markets like Hawaii and Orlando to highlight travel inspiration and offer an easy way to book flights on its airline. The partner content will feature a \u201cBook Now\u201d button to make it easy for TikTok users to take action when they're inspired.\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0expanding\u00a0its autoimmune-focused specialty pharmacy business with 25 locations throughout Alabama, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, focusing on pharmaceuticals for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal disorders and dermatological conditions. In April I reported that Walmart\u00a0closed its healthcare clinics\u00a0and sold its telehealth business to focus on the commerce-side of health versus the care-side.\n___\n**Zaxby's**\u00a0is\u00a0establishing\u00a0a loyalty and e-commerce division and hired Chris Kung to oversee the team. Hung previously worked for Dollar General where he helped the company create its myDG loyalty program and grow e-commerce sales 40x. I don't know about you, but I could certainly go for a Chicken Fingers Plate meal with a side of Zax sauce right now after reading that news!\n___\n**Hong Kong**\u00a0is\u00a0hosting\u00a0its first e-commerce festival called \u201cE-commerce Easy\u201d to boost online retail sales and promote local brands. The event is part of the government's Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading & Domestic Sales, which supports businesses in expanding their reach.\n___\n**Cameo**\u00a0was\u00a0fined $600k\u00a0for failing to comply with the FTC's rules about celebrity product endorsements. However, the company, which was once valued at $1B several years ago, can't afford to pay the fine, so New York and the other 29 states involved in the investigation are accepting $100k to be split between them. They should have just bartered for some free celebrity endorsements at that point! \u201cHi, I'm Kevin O'Leary, and I think New York is great!\u201d\n___\n**Spain**\u00a0is\u00a0aiming to become a hub\u00a0for the European data center industry, recently endorsing plans by Amazon and Microsoft to construct new data centers in the country. However Spain's government believes that the tech industry is overestimating by at least 3X what the country's demand for data center capacity will be in the next 5-7 years, and is leveraging its grip over the power grid to prevent companies from building too many data centers. The government is also steering data centers away from densely populated cities, and pushing them towards large swathes of sparsely occupied land.\u00a0\n___\n**TikTok Shop's Deals for You Days**\u00a0event\u00a0made up\u00a037% of Chinese e-commerce sales in the US during the week ending July 11th, according to a report from Earnest Analytics. In comparison, Temu made up 37.2% and Shein sales comprised 25.8%. The spend per customer reached a historic high of $52 on the platform, which is still lower than the $71 and $72 spent per shopper on Shein and Temu. People spend $72 on Temu? That must be enough to fill a shipping container!\u00a0\n___\nLast week I\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0**Meta**\u00a0was in talks to purchase a 5% stake in\u00a0**EssilorLuxottica**, the maker of Ray-Ban and about 40+ other eyewear brands, to give the company further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses. However Google is saying, \u201cNot so fast!\u201d The Verge\u00a0reports\u00a0that Google recently approached the eyewear company about integrating its Gemini AI into future smart glasses.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0and the\u00a0**Better Business Bureau**, which is apparently still relevant in 2024,\u00a0filed a joint lawsuit\u00a0against [ReviewServiceUSA.com](http:\/\/ReviewServiceUSA.com) for allegedly selling fraudulent positive reviews on Amazon product pages and BBB profiles. The lawsuit alleges that the review site used counterfeit customer accounts to post fake positive reviews aimed at inflating listings. The review site is currently down at the time of writing this.\u00a0\n___\n**Marqeta,**\u00a0a card issuing platform, is\u00a0partnering\u00a0with\u00a0**Visa**\u00a0and\u00a0**Affirm**\u00a0to provide Visa Flexible Credential, a single card product for different payment methods, in the US. The solution allows cardholders to decide whether they leverage debit, credit, BNPL, or rewards points to make payments using the same card.\n___\n**Mexico's delivery workers**\u00a0are\u00a0finding it more appealing\u00a0to deliver packages than food orders as the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms grows within the country. These platforms are hiring local logistics companies to deliver their wares, and gig workers are being drawn by the high volume of deliveries and shorter wait times to pick up the packages (compared to waiting on an order at a restaurant).\n___\n**Billie**, a B2B payments platform and provider of BNPL solutions, is\u00a0now available\u00a0via\u00a0**Stripe**, making it the first B2B BNPL solution available on the platform in Europe. During the next few months, a select number of e-commerce stores and marketplaces selling to businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands will be able to test the solution before opening it up to all businesses later this year.\n___\n**Google Merchant Center Next**, the updated version of GMC that the company announced at Google Marketing Live in 2023, is now\u00a0coming to all merchants\u00a0this month. Next will offer merchants a refreshed UI, reinvented features, and new experiences. Some merchants are\u00a0already reporting\u00a0that Next's AI features are falling short, especially when it comes to supplemental feeds and accurately pulling in products.\u00a0\n___\n**Three Walmart customers**\u00a0have\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit\u00a0against the retailer for allegedly sharing their video viewing information with Meta in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. According to the lawsuit, the shared data includes users' Facebook ID and the titles of specific video materials that were purchased by customers, and that Walmart disclosed this information without obtaining consent first. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of $2,500, a judgement against Walmart, and unlimited\u00a0Marketside Chocolate Chip Cookies\u00a0for life. (Well, that's what I would've asked for.)\n___\n**Vayu Robotics**, a Bay Area robotics startup,\u00a0unveiled\u00a0its first AI delivery robot that uses a mix of AI and low-cost passive sensors, which remove the need for expensive LiDAR technology that many autonomous vehicles use. The company explained that when you put LiDar on a robot, the cost goes up by $15k, which makes it expensive for applications like delivery, and that its new robots are easier and cheaper to manufacture, which will reduce the cost of fulfillment for D2C companies.\u00a0\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0teamed up\u00a0with\u00a0**BigCommerce**\u00a0to allow its merchants to more easily buy from Chinese suppliers and manufacturers on its website. The new app helps BigCommerce's customers better navigate [Alibaba.com](http:\/\/Alibaba.com), the company said. So here's a question\u2026 If there's an app that helps merchants navigate Alibaba's website better, why not just make that app available on Alibaba's website directly for everyone?\u00a0\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0claimed\u00a0that its new AI model,\u00a0**Llama 3.1 405B**, is the first open-source system that will rival products from OpenAI and Anthropic across a range of tasks. If true, it would mean that one of the most powerful AI models in the world is now available without an intermediary charging for access or controling what the technology is used for. The AI model is currently available for users in 22 countries through Meta.ai.\n___\n**X**\u00a0is\u00a0working on a feature\u00a0that will let users disable links in their post replies as a means to reduce the amount of spam that users see.

Hello guys, \nA friend of mine is looking to sell his product (a unique bakery\/bread product) on quick commerce like Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, Bigbasket, etc.  This product is a pioneer and is already sold in many supermarkets across Bangalore for past few years now so there is definately a big market for it. \n\nIf you are a category manager or if you can help me in listing kindly get in touch by DM or comments.  ","101":"Ethical standards of Swiggy I placed a Swiggy Instamart order but chose incorrect address by mistake. Now Swiggy cancelled the order, took back the order back to their store and are not refunding me. They claim that the policy is 100% cancellation charges. Should they not return the order amount after deducting delivery and platform fees, as they are getting back the items which they are going to sell again. It does not even seem legal to me. How can they have the money and product both with them? Absolutely disappointed by Swiggy today. \n\nPlease make sure you have the correct address set in your Instamart order because they will not refund even a penny regardless of how big your order was. \n\nHats off to such an ethical standard set by these unicorns. I am boycotting Swiggy as of today. I will go buy food from local shops,  buy groceries myself, or starve if I don't have a choice,  but I am not giving a single penny to these looters.","102":"What are you though? Does it even allowed  Hyderabad-based Suhas Shetty narrated his predicament to Startup Pedia over a phone call. Here's the condensed version:\n\n\"My name is Suhas Shetty, and I'm the founder of Iceberg Organic Ice Creams, India's first and only organic ice cream brand. We've been around for 6 years and have 50+ franchise stores in South India. Recently, we ventured into North India with a dark kitchen model, allowing customers to order through Swiggy, Zomato, and our website.\n\nIn 2023, we participated in Shark Tank India Season 3 auditions\u2026we were thrilled to be selected for the final audition in Bangalore and filmed our pitch on September 23rd. The producers even suggested a \"Bahubali\" theme for our pitch to boost viewership, and we agreed.\n\nHere's where things went south.\n\nConfirmation for our episode airing arrived in January's 2nd week, just days before the season premiere.\n\nWe received confirmation that our episode would air on March 29th, the season finale. However, on the 28th, they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation.\n\nThis news was devastating. Based on the confirmation email, we had shipped nearly Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country, perishable products with a shelf life of just 3-4 months.\n\nSince then, I've relentlessly tried contacting the Shark Tank team. They didn't respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month. We've even secured a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Bahubali film producer Shobu Yarlagadda, addressing any theme-related concerns.\n\nMy requests are simple: Air the pitch or feature it in the \"unseen pitches\" segment on YouTube, as done in previous seasons. Out of 150 pitchers, I'm the only one fateful.\n\nFrustrated, we're desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto. But for a small brand, moving Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge.\n\nWe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency. The same is expected from a platform like Shark Tank India. All I seek is a resolution \u2013 air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts.\"","103":"Swiggy instamart problem Don't know where to post this, so let me know if this is the worng group.\n\nI ordered some facewash from Swiggy instamart. When the product arrived, it had offer Buy 1 Get 1 Free printed on it in huge font.\nSo the first thought I had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 50-60% of the product cost, like most of the local shopkeepers do for BOGO. But no, what I paid on swiggy was 90% of the product cost but didn't get the fee product with it. \n\nWhen I contacted support and asked for 50% refund of the product cost or the free product, they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app.\n\nDon't you guys think it's kinda like doing fraud with the customer.\n","104":"Difference between 100% aata bread and 100% whole wheat bread? On Instamart, I see Harvest Gold 100% Aata bread and Harvest Gold 100% Whole wheat bread as two different options. The ingredients list for aata bread says Whole wheat flour 63% and for whole wheat bread says Whole wheat flour (aata) 62.5%. Both are priced at Rs 55 for 450g. I usually buy one which has an offer on MRP. English Oven also has two similar products. What is the difference? ","105":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.  ","106":"Swiggy Instamart Eggs Quality?

grocery transactions hey fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso you cannot do much in this case what the card classifies for the rewards its upto them try with customers care call and email and tell them you will complain to rbi ombudsman let us know it if works \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nwhat was the

recent times are the major factors swiggy would want to use to drive its business growth\n\n2 issue size and split\n\nit is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size swiggy ipo is worth 11327 crore and about 40 of it is fresh issue shares which is just about fine to create trust among investors\n\n3 brand name and experienced management\n\na skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an ipo as well as the companys longterm growth swiggy is a startup and doesnt have a big conglomerate to propel the business\n\nhowever the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate adapt to market trends and execute strategies effectively\n\n5 valuation\n\nswiggys management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front\n\n6 clear use of proceeds\n\nthe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the ipo such as for expansion rd or reducing debt \n\nas mentioned earlier swiggy is looking to grow its qcommerce business so a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the ipo  rs 982 crore  is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of instamarts dark store the remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same scootsy segment\n\n7 strong underwriting team\n\nunderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company scrutinizing its financial statements business model management team and future prospects this process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the ipo can signal credibility and thorough due diligence \n\nthe bookrunning lead managers or underwriters to the issue are kotak mahindra capital company jpmorgan india citigroup global markets india bofa securities india jefferies india icici securities and avendus capital most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy\n\n8 qib subscription\n\nwhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning without coming the last moment for filling the qib quota we can believing that qibs are genuinely interested in the ipo and company\n\nqib subscription had zero subscription on day 1 but the number picked up at the end of day 2 to a marginal 28 of the qib portion this means that qibs are showing only mild interest in the ipo unlike bajaj finance which was fully subscribed by qibs on day 1 itself\n\nbut considering the current market sentiments and competition with zomato it is almost certain that swiggy is set to list at a discount especially considering that the gmp of the ipo is at rs 2 less than 1 premium\n\nverdict if you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains although this is far fetched you can invest according to your risk appetite keeping in mind that the ipo is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium\n\n qib subscription numbers is one of the\u00a0major signs\u00a0to gauge interest among the bigger sharks for an ipo\n\nmost of these points are good indicators that an ipo is worth its weight its always wise to verify more than once to see if an ipo checks all the above boxes before applying even if it means waiting till day 3 before applying to an ipo\nhi ulazytransition8236 welcome to rindianstreetbets\n\nuse the daily discussion thread for basic queries before contributing do check if your

weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business people dont visit lulu just for groceries its a weekend outing for them when they go to lulu\n\n\nshopping experience  just buying stuff\n10 km away aanel  \u0d28\u0d19\u0d19\u0d7e\u0d15\u0d15 \u0d2a\u0d32\u0d7b \u0d1a\u0d2f\u0d24 \u0d2a\u0d2f\u0d7d

services would be much better if no 30min delivery for groceries\nlet me say that as an nri who frequents lulu abroad i dont enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it\n\nthe crowd and parking\n\nthe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability shopping at ramachandrans at mot is less stressful but they dont have extensive product range if youre looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit youre most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher\n\nspeaking of fruits and veggies most local vendors dont allow you to pick your own selection they mix good and stale ones and hand it over places like lulu ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so\n\nanother advantage of lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops i dont think the young gen are accustomed or most likely wont be future clients of such local butchery shops\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants\n\nduring covid after trying many home delivery services i relied mostly on am needs and farmers fresh zone the latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users the problem with farmers fresh zone was the products were okayishnot fresh and their estimated time for delivery uncertainno live tracking similar to zomatoswiggy and it seems theyve acquired am needs now\n\nhorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet\n\ncoming back to lulu shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods\nfrom my experience working in fnv sector\nthese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need dailyeven if the supply is low they need itthe company wont directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and storedthe most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storageto ensure continuous supply\nso the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired productsthe company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc and also there would be anti dumping policies they cant handle waste so let others handle em so the vendor after procuringgradingtransporting they would always be at risk of rejectionbecause of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium thats why its expensive\nthe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster before it goes stale farmers are being utilised by the corporate without them knowing it\n\nfruits and vegetables are not machine made they form naturally there would be defects and problem but you could always choose whats goodsupport local business as they are the real backbone of farmers","16":"what is this  what is this i have 2 phone numbers one

microstrategy  which holds bitcoin on its balance sheet  has had its stock outperform amazon stock by 537 in the previous year at minimum amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some even just 5 of its assets in bitcoin thats got to be the dumbest thing ive ever read if shareholders want to diversify into bitcoin sell some of your amazon stock and buy some bitcoin you dont need amazon to do it for you\n\neuropean regulators\u00a0asked google\u00a0to provide more information about a secret advertising partnership with\u00a0meta\u00a0that skirted the companys rules on how minors should be

my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit promotion council of keralavfpck which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable  vegetable wholesalers \u0d28 \u0d38\u0d2e\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d1a \u0d28\u0d15\u0d15\u0d2f bulk \u0d06\u0d2f tn farm produce \u0d35\u0d19\u0d19\u0d28\u0d28 \u0d1f\u0d38\npalayamkodan ivide 45rskilo so nadan nalla rate kittendathu aanu\nfor produce like bananas there is a local wholesaler this is how the supply chain usually works farmer  wholesaler   retailer big retailers usually bypass the wholesaler but small retailers need the wholesaler because they cant buy in bulk hotels and small tea shops buy from the wholesaler as well \n\nthe wholesaler looks for just one thing your consistency in supply for them its a numbers game more than the price they focus on moving the goods at a fast pace since their margins are low if i remember correctly a kg of banana earns them a profit of around 45 rupees my local wholesaler moves around 3 tons of banana in a day \n\nyou need to build rapport with them and they will give you a higher price for quality produce","31":"any retail stores stocking fishermans friend mints \nhas anyone come across the fishermans friend mint lozenges singles or multipacks in retail stores in the

verdict 1 company fundamentals\n\nsimilar to its competitor zomato during its ipo in 2021 swiggy is also recording net losses year after\u00a0year although the losses are narrowing down with time swiggy faces intense competition in business from zomato which has captured a lot of market share\u00a0\n\nso swiggys path to profitability is filled with challenges including zomato catering and leading even in tier2 and tier3 districts swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its qcommerce quick commerce business to become profitable\n\n2 issue size and split\n\nit is preferable that the fresh\u00a0issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size swiggy ipo is worth 11327 crore and about 40 of it is fresh issue shares which is just about fine to create trust among investors\n\n3 brand name and experienced management\n\na skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an ipo as well as the companys longterm growth swiggy is a startup and doesnt have a big conglomerate to propel the business\n\nhowever the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate adapt to market trends and execute strategies effectively\n\n5 valuation\n\nswiggys management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front\n\n6 clear use of proceeds\n\nthe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the ipo such as for expansion rd or reducing debt\u00a0\n\nas mentioned earlier\u00a0swiggy is looking to grow its qcommerce business\u00a0so a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the ipo  rs 982 crore  is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of instamarts dark store the remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same scootsy segment\n\n7 strong underwriting team\n\nunderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company scrutinizing its financial statements business model management team and future prospects this process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the ipo can signal credibility and thorough due diligence\u00a0\n\nthe bookrunning lead managers or underwriters to the issue are kotak mahindra capital company jpmorgan india citigroup global markets india bofa securities india jefferies india icici securities and avendus capital most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy\n\nbut considering the current market sentiments and competition with zomato it is almost certain that swiggy is set to list at a discount especially considering that the gmp of the ipo is at rs 12 just a 4 premium\n\nverdict if you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains although this is far fetched you can invest according to your risk appetite keeping in mind that the ipo is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium \nif you havent already please add your own analysisopinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a low effort

yearonyear6\n\n\n\n3 swiggy has expanded into quick commerce through instamart which now accounts for 40 of its revenue5\n\n\n\n4 the ipo pricing appears reasonable compared to competitor zomato with swiggy valued at 78 times pricesales4\n\n\n\n5 there is strong investor interest with big investors placing bids worth over 15 billion5\n\n\n\nconcerns\n\n1 swiggy is still unprofitable with a net loss of rs 2350 crore in fy246 analysts estimate it may take 56 quarters to turn profitable9\n\n\n\n2 the company faces intense competition from zomato which has outperformed swiggy recently in revenue and profitability metrics7\n\n\n\n3 there are concerns about urban demand slowdown and foreign investor outflows weighing on the market5\n\n\n\n4 the grey market premium indicates muted listing gains of only around 515\n\n\n\n5 some analysts caution against investing due to ongoing losses and high valuation4\n\n\n\nverdict\n\nthe swiggy ipo presents a mixed picture while the company has strong growth potential in the food delivery and quick commerce segments its lack of profitability and intense competition are key concerns the reasonable pricing compared to zomato provides some comfort\n\n\n\nfor longterm investors comfortable with high risk the ipo may be worth considering given swiggys market position and growth prospects however more conservative investors may want to wait for signs of profitability before investing those looking for listing gains should likely avoid the ipo given the muted grey market premium\n\n\n\nultimately investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the risks and their own risk appetite before making a decision consulting a financial advisor is recommended\nverdict you will get a better price than amitabh bachchan to

every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event promotion and ticket sales into its video platform the collaboration allows users to include eventbrite links into their videos which lead to information about the event and the ability to purchase tickets directly within the app tiktok says the alliance lets any tiktok user become an event creator by hosting and promoting their event directly through their videos where their audience is already engaged for example a

swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom ","41":"whats new in ecommerce \ud83d\udd25 week of july 22nd 2024 hi\u00a0\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past two years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers who will now pay up to 5 of the item purchase price plus a fixed amount of up to 100 previously sellers paid a 10 fee on every sale now they will pay a 33  45 cent payment processing fee seems high on the total amount including shipping and tax buyers will see the 5  up to 1 fee at checkout and will only pay the fixed amount once per transaction if multiple items from one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch testing showed that tracking pixels used across its website were scraping the customers address from the informed delivery landing page after customers logged in and then sending it to the tech companies informed delivery is a service that allows customers to see photos of their incoming mail before it arrives the pixels also collected other data such as information about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long however informed delivery boasts more than 62m users as of march 2024 so most likely a large portion of those customers\n\nmeta is in talks to purchase a 5 stake in essilorluxottica the maker of rayban and about 40 other eyewear brands and owner of lenscrafters sunglass hut pearle vision eyemed and other eyewear retailers and medical providers in a deal that could be worth about 473b based on the companys latest market value of 946b the deal would give meta further control over the roadmap for its smart glasses just in time for its thirdgeneration of glasses which are expected to be ready by the 2025 holiday season essilorluxottica ceo francesco milleri said that the new generation of rayban meta smart glasses launched last october have sold more in a few months than the old ones did in two years\n\ntiktok partnered with eventbrite integrating the companys event

substandard and underweight produce their refusal to remedy this after paying full premium prices will a consumer courts complaint help me get what i paid for\n\nfeel cheated every time i order from swiggy instamart for the sake of convivence mutiple times they have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in fact sending underweight might be a criminal offense   \n\n\na simple transaction of getting what i paid for as consumer shouldnt be such a gamble swiggy instamart feels like a microgambling platform where you lose all the time and the win headache of giving your feedback to the un concerned team and a take home a promise to of it being  never repeated again in the future  \n\n\ni have emails and chat logs to demonstrate their difficult and dismissive behaviour and being swindled by their claims on multiple orders spanning over few months   on principle i dont want to be scammed petty for a few rupees by a million dollar company  i have a feeling i am not alone in this as most people ignore as the amount but multiplying it by their millions of customers it not a small amount i wish we had class action lawsuits in our country   \n1 is it fruitful to lodge a complaint again then on national consumer helpline portal online  \n2 will my emails to swiggys customer care team be considered as a legal notice wherein ive mentioned it to be considered as such wow such empty much first world problem\nop any update \nhi op i just faced the same issue in my case the product was half eaten \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ni recently had a horrible experience with instamarts customer care service and this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies i had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire rooms electrical input when i plugged it in the rest of the house was fine \n\ni ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no fault of my own their responses were flat validations\n\ni then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if i were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that\n\nand i have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund\nunfortunately i am in a city where only instamart is available if not i always avoid them\n\nthis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable\ni dont know but i use blinkit as instamart isnt available in my city and blink its support is good","45":"todays headlines god bless your day with much happiness

little humanity goes a long way hi i work as a delivery person for instamart around the jayanagar area the hub is located in jayanagar kr road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi jayanagar nr colony srinagar gavipuram  banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nif youre ordering during heavy rains please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged then it falls on the delivery persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n  quick commerceinstant delivery is built on the principles of ultra cheap and readily available labour  this is the reason youd never see this work in us or eu with better equitable distribution of income \n\nthanks op for the honest account kudos to your writing skills\nthanks for this i urge everyone to at least  climb down the stairs or take a lift and collect the orders as we have to collect only one order but the delivery executive has to climb to at least 1520 homes in a day\n\nalso thanks for sharing this i saw a swiggy instamart guy riding his bike absolutely drenched in rain at 10 am this morning and i felt awful \n\nplease ride safe in the rain and stay safe cheers\naaaah\n\nsame old story with delivery gigs jobs everywhere \n\ni really hope you come out of this gutter someday \n\nthe only way this blinkit zepto instamart business survives is by exploiting folks like you \n\ndo not expect this from people ordering most are just grade a trashbags \n\nstay focused on what you will be doing next\nits a privilege really to

recommending it to people available everywhere on instamartamazon etc  \nthis is not an ad as a foodie who loves to cook but dont find much time these days due to a busy schedule i couldnt stop myself from posting about this product that i happened to order by chance when i was in kolkata through instamart they are instant liquid mixes so you dont have to do anything except for adding protein of your choice and cook ive only tried these two flavours and the taste is heavenly and has that exact bengali taste to it so for those who crave for a good kosha mangshopaturi but cant make them this is an amazing alternative  \n\npro tip   \n\nfor the kosha mangsho even though the packet says you can just add mutton with the liquid and cook instantly i first marinade the mutton with the mix and let it sit for six hours and then cook it in mustard oil  \n\nfor the mustard fish liquid a little goes a long way since it has a lot of jhaanjh and is spicy as well so the pack lasted for a week for me and i cooked four dishes borir jhaal shorshe bhindi chingri maach shorshe diye and prawn paturi with it the paste was good for a week in the fridge\n\nnext on my list is to try their chingri malaikari

vendor and hence i decided to try ordering from instamart prices were little expensive compared to local market but it was urgency for which i was ready to pay\n\none of the veggiecauliflower made me check all the other ones for their weight most of the vegetables were underweight\n\nswiggy support was shameless including their escalation team as they were not ready to replace the items and were trying to play smart with words for a partial refund\n\nfinally reported the issue to govts ingram consumer helpline and also mailed my bank to reverse credit the amount\n\nconsumer complaint is still open with swiggy responded officialy to the complaint and bank has provided provisional reverse credit for the amount\n\nlesson learnt do not go by weight stickers on products do actually check them and raise complaint when deviation observed\nand ofcourse buy from local vendors it is cheap less cumbersome\ndo not fall for discounts you will end up paying more from your pocket\n oh but of course this isnt about the refundits about the shady manipulative tricks swiggy keeps pulling think about how many orders they deliver every single day and how often they underweigh stuff compared to whats printed on the stickers its not some innocent mistake its a system\n\ntheyre probably raking in crores every single day from these small errors but sure lets wait for the standard copypaste apology or well look into it comment here so they can look like they care meanwhile the scams continue and customers just get ripped off swiggys game is strong ill give them that\nthis should be direct consumer court case they should be fined and you can follow case with cheating\nfor this i actually really like what big basket does even for a few grams difference they adjust the amount as per the weight once your order is placed been a while since i ordered from them hopefully theyre still doing it\ni have a digital scale got underweight products \n\nsame story gave me 50 refund and i agreed then i realised what about the others who doesnt have a scale how widespread this practice is\n\neven i wouldnt think to weigh it but that day my son was playing with it and thats how it came to light\nat

phone two times the battery has drained to one led light which indicates battery level to be 0 to 25\ni ordered from insta mart because it said there is a 4 day return window and in case of anything we can get it replaced today is only day 2 and when i raised a request on their app i was not able to get to the point where i swiggy offers to talk to a customer executive\ni was instead cut off with bot replies asking me to email them will be attaching screenshots below \n\nonce i email them i got a reply saying they are sad that neither refund or replacement can be done\nno reason is mentioned as to why\nim not able to raise further requests on the app also\nthen i tried instagram and i one shit reply saying my feedback is forwarded \nhow is this feedback im saying my product is defective and this is the reply\ni think they have closed their call services also\n\nnow as i was writing i got a reply on instagram asking me to contact the seller \nwhy i am well within the 4 day replacement time frame so why should i contact the seller\n\nim planning to take this up to the officals if they intend to continue giving me baseless irrelevant shady replies  ordering a power bank through swiggy not sure what to say\nits not a scam i think the powerbank is working fine if you are able to get 2 full charges with little bit left it is fine\n20k mah powerbanks will give 2 full charges for sure thats all\nlet me see if i can explain this\nsee what is the voltage of your powerbank these are normally 37 v so the total wattage is 37 v  20000 mah  37 v  20 ah  74 wh\n\nphones operate at 5 v so a single full charge of the phone need wattage  5 v  4500 mah  5 v  45 ah  225 wh\n\nso number of full charges of the phone with the powerbank  74  225  328 times considering 1015 wastage you will be able to charge it around 28 times so after 2 charges if it is having some more charge then i think that the powerbank is fine you are expecting too much from the powerbank you can buy another powerbank from amazon  flipkart but you will probably get similar results\nwhat were your expectations though\nits not a scam its working as expected i think you are misunderstanding how pb works as many comments have corrected your expectations","61":"tired of my business not growing im a soloprenuer\nive done a sale of 35 lakhs on amazon this year\nwe sell\nprotein bars with the making cost of 40 to make and we sell it at 160\nchips with the making cost of 50 and sp is 170 \n\nevery month feels like im spending more money than making it and ive no idea where am i going wrong \nive repeat customers and good reviews but hardly 10 reviews i only have money to make the products yes i make them myself and we do not have staff \n\npls help with advice  \nalso if anybody is interested in partnering up im more than happy to get into it \n\nps this is our 1 year on being on amazon \n\nedit our product is protein bar with 20g of protein and high quality ingredients and is zero sugar to fit into the keto category\n\nanyone suggesting blinkit and swiggy instamart please also send contacts if you have of these companies and know that they charge upto 1l per sku why did you start selling chocolates on amazon\ndo you think it would be better to sell chocolates directly on your website\n\nthis is my thought process\ni have never seen anyone buying chocolates from amazon until and unless it is for a gift purchase  your keywords should be around gifts\nhardly anyone would want to try new items and that too from amazon\nyou only have 10 reviews which is again quite low\n\nmy suggestion create an insta page if not created till now make some viral reels partner with micro influencers and direct customers to your websiteamazon listing if you dont have a website\ngather more reviews\n\nif you can bid on keywords wrt dairy milk gifts cadbury or other relevant keywords  use helium  do that\nits because your cost of production is too high in a country that offers protein bars for 20 and chips packets for 10 at retail points you cannot grow a business in this segment unless youre creating a legacy brand pricing and promotions are your biggest enemies a majority of indian consumers like cheap things which is why d2c companies find it so difficult to make profits on premium products\n\nill be brutally honest with you unless someone is putting a significant amount of investment into this to fix your production line and supply chain your best bet would be to either treat this as a side hustle or close it down and focus on building a different kind of a company dont waste the time that you wont get back after 10 years\ni would like to help you with your insta have you tried marketing your chocolates as protein bars or comparing it with other same price category chocolate side by side in a post format or ad format i can help with that though im not a professional but i know the basics of it\nyou can give better product at the same price or same product at lesser price\ncan you tell more about your products like what chocolates are they some gifting kind or something some info on customers too\n\nalso why not offline sales","62":"ordered milk

newsletter \ud83d\udd17 in comment i wouldnt call mamaearth a startup anymore at this point theyre a fully fledged dropshipper like boat noise boult audio at this point with a 1000 employee team either way it is a very shitty business with a very small barrier to entry if these people stop marketing their products theyre unlikely to beat unilever with their game with brands such as lakm\u00e8

and inhouse cosmetics and rd spend on introducing new products\n\nmamaearth is like micromaxkarbonlava of cosmetics industry the point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as amazon or reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of noname low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as amazon basics solimo etc\nmamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products if you make subpar products you wont last in the market why would i buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available for any cosmetic brand if you dont have repeat customers you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it\nthe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from amazon\n\ni really dont understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy its share\n\nthey really dont have anything new or niche \nanywhere good luck to them and their individual investors\nhow can quick commerce be competition they sell through thay channel\n\nblinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nbaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so i doubt it will get any better\n\nthey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\ndirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of tapping into price conscious market\nprofit kamaye mera l pehle insta pe thoda naach gaan aur ladkiyon ko female entrepreneurship ka gyan chod du","67":"delivery and restaurant scams on swiggyzomato the most delivery associates ask for is a rating but over the years and across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many never order cod if the person ordering is not present to take the order delivery guys deliberately ask for more if elderly people receive the order and they may also shout and threaten elderly if they dont pay up immediately have read so many cases about this\nfake images in listings is not a swiggy scam you dont get shah rukh khan with lux and juhi chawla with taaza people know this for ages\n\npump and dump is a term used for an actual fraud what you are describing is a legit way how business works","68":"recommend best credit cards for the following lifestyle can you help optimize for the following spending patterns i am okay to get different

swiggy and instamart with product delivery and its alleged ways to dupe its customers in various ways since its ipo would be lovely to know what the community thinks is primarily wrong with the company and is not being talked about enough\n\nps dms are open for anything swiggy happy to share few details one of my post on reddit went really viral and was covered by many media houses\n\nfew issues we as customer face are\n1 at certain times the product delivered  is either beyond expiry or is stale has moldfungus or infested this happens with both food and instamart orders\n2 non veg food is provided even though vegetarian product wad ordered\n3 listing issues where non vegetarian food is listed under vegetarian only items\n4 delivery issues where the delivery executive picked up the order and then switched off the phone or refuses to deliver the food\n5 delivery executive trying to takeover a customer account by initiating otp for login and once have access to it they change the phone number and email and then order bulk food and groceries at their preferred location with cash on delivery without payinghappy to share more information on this as this happened a while back with me and wife\n6 under weight items delivered vs promised weight\n\nearlier swiggy used to own all such issues and help out customers by either replacing items banning a restaurant or giving a full refund and used to charge a lot less ofcourse they wanted to onboard more customers and hence were helpful\n\nnow they charge high amount of different fees surcharge etc but when you report an issue there responses are\n1 swiggy is only an aggrigator use google to put in a negative review\n2 a user waiting for their food or groceries for few hours and support tells them they cannot cancel the order if cancelled all charges will be paid by user this too when delivery executive is not picking calls or refusing to deliver the order\n3 for underweight stale pest infested items missing items either refusing refund or giving partial refund which does not even matches the price of affected items\n\nthis will be a long list hence will leave it to others to add\nthank you for taking this up\nswiggy and zomato give lesser benefits to their most loyal customers \n\nrecently an asci study revealed that 52 out of 53 apps they examined had dark design patterns\n\n\n\nmany of us are familiar with the common dark patterns used by apps i want to list a few less obvious dark patterns\n\n\n\nvariable pricing the pricing for swiggy one and zomato gold varies from user to user the more frequently you order food the higher the price for you this is because the platforms are compensating for the loss of profit on delivery charges some users even have a negative score meaning they arent shown the option to buy zomato gold\n\n\n\nlimited options in bad weather if you buy swiggy one you might find yourself at a disadvantage during rainy weather which is common in bangalore when it rains youll be shown fewer restaurant options and many become undeliverable you can test this yourself the next time it rains many restaurants are available for nonswiggy one users but are not available for swiggy one users possibly due to the delivery charge\n\n\n\nincreasing prices at favorite restaurants the more often you order from your favorite restaurant the higher the prices become youll receive fewer discounts with each order\n\n\n\npacking charges charging 50 for packing is outrageous its robbery\ndelivery distance  i have a post here \nplatform fees what and why the heck is that even a thing  ill never know they already markup prices what is this fee for just look at the numbers theyll swindle\n","70":"airtel axis card doesnt give 10 cashback for swiggy dineout i have

chocolate and snacks through instamart for my train journey only to realise midjourney that the chocolate had expired a month ago when i raised this issue with swiggy they claimed they couldnt validate my claim and refused to refund the money i still have the chocolate with me despite bringing this up on x they insisted they cant do anything how is it fair that we have to pay for expired products while they get away with it what are my options here consumer forum\nask a lawyer to send notice through email on your behalf bas wait and watch how fast your refund and apology will come through\ndisclaimer not a law practitioner nor giving out legal advices  \n  \nnot sure if you can raise it with the fssai but no harm in speaking to them to get directions on dealing with the problem  \n\n\nif you are able to proceed from here please keep the thread updated\ndont let them get away with this zomato and swiggy are notorious for this nonsense of sending subpar quality crap and then not owning up to their mistakenot giving a refund\ni recently had a horrible experience with instamarts customer care service and this was by far not my first time being deeply disappointed with their standards and policies i had ordered an extension cord which ended up being faulty and tripped my entire rooms electrical input when i plugged it in the rest of the house was fine \n\ni ended up having to call on an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no fault of my own their responses were flat validations\n\ni then proceeded to ask them if they would foot my expenses thus far if i were to send them a video of plugging in this device and incur the damages again they said they could not do that\n\nand i have had other instances wherein a video is a must for them to judge the grounds for a refund\nunfortunately i am in a city where only instamart is available if not i always avoid them\n\nthis is beyond comprehensible let alone acceptable","76":"any review on this priced at 500 something on swiggy instamart \nis this product worth

credit cards suggestions my family has no history or interest in using credit cards so i dont know much about them using them as loan service is not what i am looking for my purpose is to find cards that can give cashback or similar rewards\n\nheres more about me\n\n 25m earning 17lpa my salary account is with canara bank simply because its at walking distance from my house will i lose out on much by not switching it to a different bank\n\n not a big spender at all i live with parents and save majority of my money my monthly expenses are about 1520k unless i buy some expensive piece of tech or some computer parts\n\n the above mentioned gadgets and tech stuff is usually bought from third party local vendors who know their products and customers basically i dont order much from amazon its just stuff like hair trimmer rechargable batteries etc id say monthly i spend about 2k or less on amazon so not sure if their card would make much sense for me my dad orders on the behalf of his office friends so he has an active account on both amazon and flipkart but unfortunately he said no for either of their credit cards\n\n i buy expensive stuff like anc headphones or high end phone from croma offline planning to buy a mirrorless camera from their store in future\n\n not a traveller but i am planning to go on international trips once my friend gets settled properly domestic trips are extremely rare for me not exactly dying for lounge access but itd be nice to have it ig\n\n i mostly use swiggy for both instamart and food deliveries recently tried dineout and it seemed fine too id say i spend around 67k monthly on swiggy only this made me consider getting the swiggy hdfc card cause it showed there wont be any extra charges basically what people here call ltf reason why i didnt get it yet is people here dont recommend getting a co branded card first \n\n i dont go out to to eat in restaraunts often id say about once in 2 months\n\n not really interested in buying stuff on emi but i wont mind no cost emi if there are additional discounts i dont know if that is the case generally or if the additional discounts are what give it the meaning no cost\n\n i dont travel much within delhi either i do use uber on occasions my work is mostly wfh and even if i have to go to the office we have transport provided by the office\n\n i am very sketchy of credit cards in general as they basically let you spend money that you dont have which means if it gets lost of stolen someone can put me in massive debt i also see posts of people finding out about loans against there account that they didnt apply for idk how it happens but id definitely like to make sure my information is safe and i dont fall prey to such things\n\n i am not loyal to a brand like apple or samsung i dont have any eco system and neither am i aiming to build one\n\n dont have a car yet might own one in the future but again my fuel expenses wont be a lot\n\n dont have any loans or pending emi\n\n dont have any netflix prime or similar subscriptions i rarely buy pc games mostly sail the high seas\n\n i occasionally buy clothes from hnm uniqlo and myntraa\n\n my mother is really into buying gold stuff but i doubt if theres anything for that\n\n i personally dont use airtel but my parents have a sim card each they also use airtel dth i read about airtel axis card so i can consider getting it and paying for my parents bills\n\n i dont have experience of dealing with banks and stuff as of now i dont even know how to get a credit card is it just an online process do i need to visit bank do i need to call bank id prefer to avoid frequent bank visits and getting on calls\n\n i dont know much about credit score or limit and all that stuff\n\nin the end i only want to use credit cards like my debit card while optimizing cashback rewards swiggy hdfc card showed that id get about 78k cashback per year based on how much i spend on swiggy monthly and thats pretty much what made me consider having one and get to know more about this rabit hole\n\nid be really grateful for good recommendations this url has answers to most of the questions\n\n\ngifgiphyuzjtsy1bypncxj5mtadownsized\namazon pay icici swiggy hdfc and idfc first select id suggest these 3 for basicbeginners and later on you can apply for more specific ones\n\ni believe if u switch salary wcc to hdfc you can get the regalia too as ltf which is a really good card\nget that hdfc swiggy as ltf and also consider getting hdfc tata new not sure if you will be able to get both the hdfc co branded cards but your purchases from croma online or offline and gold purchase maybe from tanishq will be covered through it along with bill payments on tata neu

gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease with ibd you will not be able to drink milk and several foods you will also get bloody diarrhoea and constipation on a frequent basis this is an incurable disease but you can put it in remission until it comes back again flareup\n\ndoctors may also do colonoscopy you will have to get naked and they will stick a device up your rectum and go deep into your intestine\n\nhowever multiple recent studies have shown detrimental roles played by maltodextrin in the intestinal environment suggesting that this broadly used food additive may play a role in the rapid increased incidence of chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome in this issue of\u00a0cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology laudisi et\u00a0al1\u00a0add a new line to this list of evidences with the investigation of the impact of maltodextrin on murine models of colitis by using 2 different models of colitis the investigators found that consumption of maltodextrin exacerbated intestinal inflammation in a dosedependent manner mechanistically such detrimental effects of maltodextrin were linked to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent alterations of the protective mucus layer importantly pharmacologic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress was sufficient to prevent maltodextrininduced intestinal inflammation and associated depletion in the mucus layer1\n\n  \n\n\ngas diarrhoea bloating can be caused by high doses of maltodextrin avoid processed foods such as chips and nutrition bars many popular foods contain maltodextrin\n\nsources \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\ndextrose is a very high glycemic index sweetener it is also used as a preservative diabetics may keep a dextrose tablet with them so that if their blood sugar falls too low and they are about to faint chewing the tablet will cause a huge increase in sugar levels this is what fast and up includes in their products\n\nyou are at increased risk of diabetes obesity and even heart and kidney disease due to the high sugar content your kidneys will get stressed excreting them it can also cause fatty liver disease and insulin resistance\n\n\n\nmaybe an athlete will need these sweeteners to increase their energy levels drastically and therefore it is suitable for them but many people with sedentary lifestyles such as elderly respiratory disease patients and children definitely dont need it   \n  \nthey can buy nacglutathione tablets in tablet form only not effervescent tablet it wont be sweet and it actually smells like shit but you dont need to bite it just swallow it with a glass of water and you are good to go it will detoxify your lungs and liver and make your life better and thats because those tablets dont have maltodextrin and dextrose our countrys drug and supplement regulation is terrible anyone can fill chalk powder capsules and sell them through pharmacies and no one from the regulatory agency will bat an eye","81":"please rate my high level design for instamartzeptoblinkit hi guys im practicing for system design interviews and created a hld for instamartblinkit please review it and suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n namaste\nthanks for submitting to rdevelopersindia make sure to follow the community code of conduct and rules while

go back and read about it can you tell me what is the difference between ai and agi\n\nme no clue about it blabbered about agi being able to generate responses related to overall general awareness and

consumer can extend their shelf life as it is not close to expiry\n\nm2 then what happens to the earlier batches\n\nme they are also pushed out to consumers but its upto the retailer on how they choose to sell those products gave an example of bread being closer to expiry being sent on swiggy instamart\n\nm2 can you think of why changing from lifo to fifo inventory management system can cause auditor to raise concerns\n\nme the auditor might not be satisfied with the quality of product being sent out since it might be close to expiry\n\nm2 consumer is still getting the product can you

order back to their store and are not refunding me they claim that the policy is 100 cancellation charges should they not return the order amount after deducting delivery and platform fees as they are getting back the items which they are going to sell again it does not even seem legal to me how can they have the money and product both with them absolutely disappointed by swiggy today \n\nplease make sure you have the correct address set in your instamart order because they will not refund even a penny regardless of how big your order was \n\nhats off to such an ethical standard set by these unicorns i am boycotting swiggy as of today i will go buy food from local shops  buy groceries myself or starve if i dont have a choice  but i am not giving a single penny to these looters i think its not their fault as they have already mentioned it that you wont get any refund in case of cancellation you shouldnt blame them for choosing the incorrect address imo\nin such a case you should call the delivery guy and offer to pay him to come drop it to your correct address ive done it a few times on zomato and swiggy but my addresses were within 78km radius\nor if you had ordered to a friends house could have gotten it delivered there and gotten it picked up by dunzogenie\nor just told the delivery man to enjoy the order better him profiting than swiggy \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\nmandi or kirana is good swiggy and similar for timebound stuff like you forgot something or its some fancy thing which is only at a fancy supermarket and you dont want to drive out","102":"what are you though does it even allowed  hyderabadbased suhas shetty narrated his predicament to startup pedia over a phone call heres the condensed version\n\nmy name is suhas shetty and im the founder of iceberg organic ice creams indias first and only organic ice cream brand weve been around for 6 years and have 50 franchise stores in south india recently we ventured into north india with a dark kitchen model allowing customers to order through swiggy zomato and our website\n\nin 2023 we participated in shark tank india season 3 auditionswe were thrilled to be selected for the final audition in bangalore and filmed our pitch on september 23rd the producers even suggested a bahubali theme for our pitch to boost viewership and we agreed\n\nheres where things went south\n\nconfirmation for our episode airing arrived in januarys 2nd week just days before the season premiere\n\nwe received confirmation that our episode would air on march 29th the season finale however on the 28th they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation\n\nthis news was devastating based on the confirmation email we had shipped nearly rs 15 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country perishable products with a shelf life of just 34 months\n\nsince then ive relentlessly tried contacting the shark tank team they didnt respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month weve even secured a no objection certificate noc from bahubali film producer shobu yarlagadda addressing any themerelated concerns\n\nmy requests are simple air the pitch or feature it in the unseen pitches segment on youtube as done in previous seasons out of 150 pitchers im the only one fateful\n\nfrustrated were desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with blinkit instamart and zepto but for a small brand moving rs 15 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge\n\nwe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency the same is expected from a platform like shark tank india all i seek is a resolution  air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts its should be gone viral on twitter and linkedin then its possible","103":"swiggy instamart problem dont know where to post this so let me know if this is the worng group\n\ni ordered some facewash from swiggy instamart when the product arrived it had offer buy 1 get 1 free printed on it in huge font\nso the first thought i had was that swiggy would be selling the single product on around 5060 of the product cost like most of the local shopkeepers do for bogo but no what i paid on swiggy was 90 of the product cost but didnt get the fee product with it \n\nwhen i contacted support and asked for 50 refund of the product cost or the free product they said that all they can do is give a small coupon as this offer was never mentioned on their app\n\ndont you guys think its kinda like doing fraud with the customer\n ","104":"difference between 100 aata bread and 100 whole

happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i havent used instamart a lot in these months\n\nthats all please take this

carefully breaking em the yolk is already disintegrated  the white is unusually thin anyone else noticed this not only that most of the time the eggs are rancid once a broken maggoty egg fused itself

everywhere been wondering where you guys get your cigarettes from cause everywhere i go i get fakelow quality ones the difference is very obvious to a very occasional smoker like me i know instamart but then youd have to buy a whole pack are there any shops around there have never been a better reason to quit smoking do it\ni stopped smoking because of this reason cant get good ones where i live\nfake cigarettes athu enthu sadhanam\nthey arent always fake poor storage can also affect the quality of cigarettes one way to identify the fake one is to look at the label on the bud in the brandname written in red or blueassuming youre smoking kings or lights there will be 2 red semi circles above and below if the colour is the same on both theyre mostly fake id the semi circles have a lighter and a darker colour more probable that theyre original not a sure shot way tho just an information passed on by a friend not sure how true\n\n\nas a regular smoker i recommend you smoke high

protein rice and long cut roasted vermicelli \nis there anything i should be keeping in mind apart from quality checks  good packaging for now \ni have to start building social media around this and i am planning to sell via quick commerce like blinkit bigbasket instamart etc \nany one who can help me with growth of the brand organically \n\nps  this is my first startup and i plan to make it successful as i am bootstrapped by myself and my savings \n\nany input would be greatly appreciated thanks  i was going through your responses and realised you were keen on going heavy on social media this is a common strategy for d2c brands in a crowded space however there will be competitors with deep pockets due to external funding which can turn out to be in your favour let me explain\n\ni have recently shifted from corporate to start my own independent agency and through that i have consulted a few d2c brands that were recently funded the one thing every founder is eager to do is run paid ads \n\ni have seen good ideas turn into a disaster because founders marketed their products too early   \n  \nthus if you can identify your niche take your time to really understand your customer and create a targeted plan for reaching that customer slowly but surely you can achieve success  \n  \nbut the journey will be long and you will have to grind in silence an often overlooked thing is that founders who receive funding are often put into the limelight which acts as a motivational factor at times it takes greater courage and determination to build something in silence and keep improving every day\n\nmy close friend built a 100 million dollar saas company completely bootstrapped and it took him 4 excruciatingly long years of grinding but it was worth it for him\n\nmy team has been asking me to create a pdf on the topic the ultimate d2c ecommerce checklist before you start paid marketing maybe i can dm it to you once its ready\n\nall the best to you and i hope you can make it\ncheck dm\nyeah quick commerce is the best way \nyeah quick commerce is the best way \ni have a question regarding your startup is this not already too crowded what is the differentiator in your

the next purchase which is reasonable but im just pointing it out because i havent seen that going on in other grocery apps and websites\nregularly ordering from big basket for 6 months now\n\ngood

every day soya twice a week i need to eat more protein but dont have time to cook chicken  hate eggs and meat like beef mutton and fish the salami that you can buy from these online shops are quick alternative it just needs to be pan fried and can be eaten as a meal i see 2 issues with salami  1 high fat content 2 cancer risk  salami and other products contain high amount of preservatives which increases colon cancer risk \ncan you guys let me know whether salami is good for daily consumption why dont you find a local butcher and buy boneless chicken from him just boil it shred it and then you have countless recipes to make chicken sandwich chicken rice bowl chicken rolls etc etc\n\nyoull save a lot of money and itll be a fresher n healthier alternative as compared to salami processed meat products like salami sausages have a lot of unwanted additives\ntry to eat non processed meat\nthe protein to cals ratio is very low an egg is far better\nplease google how sausagessalamis are made you will get an idea usually they use cheapest left overs of chickenpork blend it all together add spices to it the protein content is very low and its high in sodium and other additives \nbest

hey fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes

fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know

competitor zomato during its ipo in 2021 swiggy is also recording net losses year after year although the losses are narrowing down with time swiggy faces intense competition in business from zomato which has captured a lot of market share \n\nso swiggys path to profitability is filled with challenges including zomato catering and leading even in tier2 and tier3 districts swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its qcommerce quick commerce business to become profitable\n\ntenfold growth is expected in 2028 for the qcommerce segment and the quick growth in the number of dark stores in recent times are the major factors swiggy would want to use to drive its business growth\n\n2 issue size and split\n\nit is preferable that the fresh issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size swiggy ipo is worth 11327 crore and about 40 of it is fresh issue shares which is just about fine to create trust among investors\n\n3 brand name and experienced management\n\na skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an ipo as well as the companys longterm growth swiggy is a startup and doesnt have a big conglomerate to propel the business\n\nhowever the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate adapt to market trends and execute strategies effectively\n\n5 valuation\n\nswiggys management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front\n\n6 clear use of proceeds\n\nthe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the ipo such as for expansion rd or reducing debt \n\nas mentioned earlier swiggy is looking to grow its qcommerce business so a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the ipo  rs 982 crore  is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of instamarts dark store the remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same scootsy segment\n\n7 strong underwriting team\n\nunderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company scrutinizing its financial statements business model management team and future prospects this process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the ipo can signal credibility and thorough due diligence \n\nthe bookrunning lead managers or underwriters to the issue are kotak mahindra capital company jpmorgan india citigroup global markets india bofa securities india jefferies india icici securities and avendus capital most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy\n\n8 qib subscription\n\nwhen the big players are subscribing in the beginning without coming the last moment for filling the qib quota we can believing that qibs are genuinely interested in the ipo and company\n\nqib subscription had zero subscription on day 1 but the number picked up at the end of day 2 to a marginal 28 of the qib portion this means that qibs are showing only mild interest in the ipo unlike bajaj finance which was fully subscribed by qibs on day 1 itself\n\nbut considering the current market sentiments and competition with zomato it is almost certain that swiggy is set to list at a discount especially considering that the gmp of the ipo is at rs 2 less than 1 premium\n\nverdict if you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains although this is far fetched you can invest according to your risk appetite keeping in mind that the ipo is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium\n\n qib subscription numbers is one of the\u00a0major signs\u00a0to gauge interest among the bigger sharks for an ipo\n\nmost of these points are good indicators that an ipo is worth its weight its always wise to verify more than once to see if an ipo checks all the above boxes before applying even if it means waiting till day 3 before applying to an ipo\nhi ulazytransition8236 welcome to rindianstreetbets\n\nuse the daily discussion thread for basic queries before contributing do check if your

live more than 10 kilometers away from lulu mall but i still visit it once a week either on weekends or weekdays lately ive been feeling guilty about bypassing local vendors and going to lulu for groceries thinking their veggies are of better quality we cant just ignore local vendors even if they are overpriced and assume they dont provide quality ive compared prices and found that local groceries are about  70 rupees cheapermore expensive considering the cost of petrol and the time spent in the queue to bill the veggies how have we become tolerant of these inconveniences lately\n\nits not just about the money my biggest concern is why do we go to supermarkets just for groceries dont say we dont only go for groceries many people does this were wasting money on petrol and time stuck in traffic the traffic and parking at lulu are overcrowded is it worth wasting our weekend or weekday time in traffic just to visit the mall only to find theres not even enough space to sit who benefits from spending 30 minutes just to park and buy groceries dont ask  are you buying from onlineamazonflipkart or offline i find where things are cheaper and return items if they lack quality im just saying only groceries do not buy groceries at lulu spending your time energy and moneyit is a total waste\n\ncan anyone prove that lulus vegetables are better they are super duper expensive and the quality is the same as what you get at any local shop how can a local street vendor compete against these big big supermarkets daily some people say thats why swiggy instamart is there to support these vendors but thats another topic for debate\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants lets say swiggy at 120 lulu at 110 and amazon fresh at 115 we offer 120  20 for delivery as well plus if you subscribe we waive the delivery charges for a monthly subscription it can be based on ratings of nearby street vendors nowadays no one can escape ratings and reviewsits competition in itself so vendors wont send spoiled items because bad ratings would spoil their business people dont visit lulu just for groceries its a weekend outing for them when they go to lulu\n\n\nshopping experience  just buying stuff\n10 km

better if no 30min delivery for groceries\nlet me say that as an nri who frequents lulu abroad i dont enjoy visiting lulu in tvm and have only visited like once and hated it\n\nthe crowd and parking\n\nthe advantages i see shopping at lulu tvm is wide range of product availability shopping at ramachandrans at mot is less stressful but they dont have extensive product range if youre looking for a particular brand of coffee or biscuit youre most likely not find it there but chances of finding it in lulu are higher\n\nspeaking of fruits and veggies most local vendors dont allow you to pick your own selection they mix good and stale ones and hand it over places like lulu ramachandrans or pothys give you an option to do so\n\nanother advantage of lulu is the hygiene standards are much better than local butchery shops i dont think the young gen are accustomed or most likely wont be future clients of such local butchery shops\n\ncan anyone start a delivery business like swiggy instamart that sources from local vendors and delivers in the same way in less than 30 minutes with competitive rates compared to these giants\n\nduring covid after trying many home delivery services i relied mostly on am needs and farmers fresh zone the latter claims to be a startup where they connect farmers with end users the problem with farmers fresh zone was the products were okayishnot fresh and their estimated time for delivery uncertainno live tracking similar to zomatoswiggy and it seems theyve acquired am needs now\n\nhorticorp provides decebr veggies but you might not be able to meet all your needs from a single outlet\n\ncoming back to lulu shopping is fine there if one sticks to the shopping list and not get lured by the offers or any unnessary goods\nfrom my experience working in fnv sector\nthese hypermarkets and supermarkets have a list of fruits and vegetables they need dailyeven if the supply is low they need itthe company wont directly go to the farmers or the wholesaler directly to procure the product because they only deal with at max 10 products moreover \nthe company should make sure that the product is graded sorted and storedthe most expensive part because of the requirement of a cold storageto ensure continuous supply\nso the solution is that there would be vendors who would get them their desired productsthe company will also have many quality standards set such as the weight colour etc and also there would be anti dumping policies they cant handle waste so let others handle em so the vendor after procuringgradingtransporting they would always be at risk of rejectionbecause of this risk and work the vendors would charge a premium thats why its expensive\nthe fnv sector is very unorganised and farmers need to sell their produce faster before it goes stale farmers are being utilised by the corporate without them knowing it\n\nfruits and vegetables are not machine made they form naturally there would be defects and problem but you could always choose whats goodsupport local business as they are the real backbone of

since my dad retired and to have an active lifestyle with engagement he ventured into farmingwhich actually keeps him happy as well \n\nhave lots of land lying vacant and we put them to good use i help him whenever im back home \n\nhome grown harvest is entirely different from what gets sold in the market a whole difference in taste and freshness \n\nas we cant consume the entire harvest by ourselves even after giving out to our extended family we try to sell them outside \n\nthe problem like everyone knows is the price\n\nheres how our experience have been so far\n\n1neighbours there are some people who are happy to offer market rates and buy from us but cant take away larger quantities \n\n2 small shops some small shops give us a better price but since the business volume is low they too purchase small quantity then there are shops that lowball us i mean sure they get stuff from tn sprayed with god knows what cheaply obviously we cant match their price \n\n3 larger shops are a whole different level they are happy to take our produce but wont give us a price in advance until we unload our goods there and they see it physically post unloading they give low ball offer at this stage we simply have to give at whatever price they offer as its difficult to load it back and take it away \n\nhave stopped dealing with them after few poor experiences they give us rural rates and sell at urban prices i wouldnt like to name any particular businesses but when you buy from shops that claim to be organic or home grown produce those are the ones \n\n4 apps are nothing but larger shop behavior with electronic interface they charge us a platform fee which is a significant sum upfront and then we have to constantly supply them they wont let us advertise our produce for the price we prefer they also charge higher commissionsnot reasonable their back end support system is bad too they often pick the produce late and in the case of any customer complaints it gets deducted from us the customer complaints happen due to poor goods handling from their side but suppliers like us have to bear it \n\n5 farming societies dont operate actively in our area so procurement from govt is nearly non existent \n\n6 local markets here too the goods get loaded are from other states getting a favourable spot or stand often leads to fights breaking out that small timers often stand outside the market to sell produce \n\nto see how crazy the priceparticularly when horticrops dont have mrp is sold a bundle of palayamthodan pazham at nearby shop for rs35 a kginitially offered rs30 \n\na quick search at swiggy instamart shows that variety commanding a retail price of rs75 a kgthis after crossing out rs99 \ud83d\ude02\n\nnow think how much money the city folks spend on horticrops ordering them online in the name of convinience and how much the farmer earns from it \n\nwe are not dependent on farming income to sustain ourselves but think of the people who do \n\neverytime govt irrespective of party announces support to farmers but nothing actually flows down \n\ncant really compete with the tn produce but without encouraging farming in our state we are putting our state food security at risk what happens when we have inter state disputes wrt to water sharing or dams \n\nive heard once that kerala govt is announcing special labelling where kerala agri produce is labelled and marketed differently in storee so people buy goods produced in our state but ive not seen any \n\nwhile govt spends money on apps for activities like ott ride sharingnot functional now and others why isnt a platform being developed for price discovery and marketing \n\nthere is a vegetable and fruit promotion council of keralavfpck which displays prices at key mandis of the state but the price disparity and distortion are extreme and unreliable  vegetable wholesalers \u0d28 \u0d38\u0d2e\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d1a \u0d28\u0d15\u0d15\u0d2f bulk \u0d06\u0d2f tn farm produce

works farmer  wholesaler   retailer big retailers usually bypass the wholesaler but small retailers need the wholesaler because they cant buy in bulk hotels and small tea shops buy from the wholesaler as well \n\nthe wholesaler looks for just one thing your consistency in supply for them its a numbers game more than the price they focus on moving the goods at a fast pace since their margins are low if i remember correctly a kg of banana earns them a profit of around 45 rupees my local wholesaler moves around 3 tons of banana in a day \n\nyou need to build rapport with them and they will give you a higher price for quality produce"}]],"31":[[{"negative":0.034812849,"neutral":0.9487755895,"positive":0.0164116025,"aspect":"instamart","text":"any retail stores stocking fishermans friend mints

analysis and verdict 1 company fundamentals\n\nsimilar to its competitor zomato during its ipo in 2021 swiggy is also recording net losses year after\u00a0year although the losses are narrowing down with time swiggy faces intense competition in business from zomato which has captured a lot of market share\u00a0\n\nso swiggys path to profitability is filled with challenges including zomato catering and leading even in tier2 and tier3 districts swiggy is mainly planning to leverage its qcommerce quick commerce business to become profitable\n\n2 issue size and split\n\nit is preferable that the fresh\u00a0issue size should not be much less in proportion to the total issue size swiggy ipo is worth 11327 crore and about 40 of it is fresh issue shares which is just about fine to create trust among investors\n\n3 brand name and experienced management\n\na skilled and experienced management team can significantly influence the success of an ipo as well as the companys longterm growth swiggy is a startup and doesnt have a big conglomerate to propel the business\n\nhowever the company has a strong management and team with the ability to innovate adapt to market trends and execute strategies effectively\n\n5 valuation\n\nswiggys management has factored in the market volatility and has been adjusting the target valuation of the company accordingly which gives confidence to investors on the valuation front\n\n6 clear use of proceeds\n\nthe company should provide a clear plan for how it intends to use the funds raised from the ipo such as for expansion rd or reducing debt\u00a0\n\nas mentioned earlier\u00a0swiggy is looking to grow its qcommerce business\u00a0so a bulk of the fresh capital proceeds from the ipo  rs 982 crore  is expected to be deployed towards the expansion of instamarts dark store the remaining amount is planned to be used for investment in scootsy and for repayment of its borrowings for the same scootsy segment\n\n7 strong underwriting team\n\nunderwriters conduct rigorous due diligence on the company scrutinizing its financial statements business model management team and future prospects this process helps to identify potential risks and opportunities therefore reputable underwriters or investment banks backing the ipo can signal credibility and thorough due diligence\u00a0\n\nthe bookrunning lead managers or underwriters to the issue are kotak mahindra capital company jpmorgan india citigroup global markets india bofa securities india jefferies india icici securities and avendus capital most of the above names are reputed and trustworthy\n\nbut considering the current market sentiments and competition with zomato it is almost certain that swiggy is set to list at a discount especially considering that the gmp of the ipo is at rs 12 just a 4 premium\n\nverdict if you are still willing to take the risk for marginal gains although this is far fetched you can invest according to your risk appetite keeping in mind that the ipo is more likely to list at a discount than at a premium \nif you havent already please add your own analysisopinions to your post to save it from being removed for being a low effort

swiggy is one of indias leading food and grocery delivery platforms with a strong market position12\n\n\n\n2 the company has shown steady revenue growth with fy24 revenues at rs 11634 crore up 361 yearonyear6\n\n\n\n3 swiggy has expanded into quick commerce through instamart which now accounts for 40 of its revenue5\n\n\n\n4 the ipo pricing appears reasonable compared to competitor zomato with swiggy valued at 78 times pricesales4\n\n\n\n5 there is strong investor interest with big investors placing bids worth over 15 billion5\n\n\n\nconcerns\n\n1 swiggy is still unprofitable with a net loss of rs 2350 crore in fy246 analysts estimate it may take 56 quarters to turn profitable9\n\n\n\n2 the company faces intense competition from zomato which has outperformed swiggy recently in revenue and profitability metrics7\n\n\n\n3 there are concerns about urban demand slowdown and foreign investor outflows weighing on the market5\n\n\n\n4 the grey market premium indicates muted listing gains of only around 515\n\n\n\n5 some analysts caution against investing due to ongoing losses and high valuation4\n\n\n\nverdict\n\nthe swiggy ipo presents a mixed picture while the company has strong growth potential in the food delivery and quick commerce segments its lack of profitability and intense competition are key concerns the reasonable pricing compared to zomato provides some comfort\n\n\n\nfor longterm investors comfortable with high risk the ipo may be worth considering given swiggys market position and growth prospects however more conservative investors may want to wait for signs of profitability before investing those looking for listing gains should likely avoid the ipo given the muted grey market premium\n\n\n\nultimately investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the risks and their own risk appetite before making a decision consulting a financial advisor is recommended\nverdict you will get a better price than amitabh bachchan to

stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week amazon makes up about onetenth of our profits but it takes up about 90 percent of the working day said jeremy walker a store associate who worked at a ups store near dallas that received between 300 and 600 returns per day  according to the washington post\n\namazon prime day shoppers in the us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us

one seller are purchased together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to

about the users computer type and browser their live location and tracking numbers entered into the usps website its not clear how many individuals had their information collected or for how long

using swiggy instamart and rant posting on behalf of a friend in her words  \n31f booked an order on swiggy instamart for several house hold items and food products today for rs 2400 even added a tip for the delivery agent \n\ni had to put the bag down momentarily on my sofas armrest to collect 2 frozen items that the delivery agents hands over separately just when i closed the door and started to walk to the kitchen where i unpack groceries i started to faintly smell bleach harpic \n\ni was hit by a blast of bleach fumes as soon as i cut open the top of the bag delivery agent was gone by then there was lightno wetness on items at the top but the more i got to the bottom there was significant wetness on the items the bleach smell from the harpic bleach white bottles fumes i had ordered was very strong even burning my eyes slightly at this point \n\n\ni took pictures and sent it on swiggy instamart chat there is a pool of bleach at the bottom there is even a picture where i lifted the bag up and theres so much bleach on the kitchen counter  it leaked through the bagholes in it\nswiggy instamart compleyely refused to replacerefundexchange  \n\n\nmy hands and most of my house was smelling of bleach at this point checked and found that the spot on my sofas armrest where i put the bag down while taking the delivery was soaked in bleach  i started to panicclean and get rid of the bleach and other items soaked in it so that were not continuing to inhale and touch such a strong toxic toilet cleaning chemical \n\n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\nswiggy called me since i wasnt responding on chat and continued to offer a refund only for one leaking bleach bottle and later closed the chat saying they dont see anything wrong with the pics so wont even process that refund \nthey didnt even try to acknowledge the dangers of touching touchtransfering and consuming products exposed to bleach in any manner  \n\n\ni offered several solutions  \n1 reverse pickup all items and give me a full refund gurmeet kaur supervisor refused why  \n2 i would have been ok for them to pick up all items and replace it with a fresh order they didnt even want to speak about solutioning this  \n3 i asked for an exchangefull refund of all food products atleast since bleach can literally hospitalizekill you  she refused  i had sent 57 pictures showing a small pool of bleach at the bottom of the bag and leaking bottles already but she said i need to send her pictures of all items with bleach on it i told her you cant see wetness on all products unless its dripping wet but you can feel the sliminess or smell it so how are pictures going to help   and i had already started to discard the items since the smell was unbearable and were getting exposed to it \n4 even if theres a chance few other items didnt make contact with the bleach it was sitting in the same bag as leaking bleach bleach fumes are enough to contaminate any thing i would not risk mine or anybodys health by allowing them to eat these items basic common sense i had bought snacks for visiting kids today but she refused to agree there was even a problem here  \n5 not only do i have to throw several of the items i ordered cause they are no longer safe i also have to clean my counter tops get rid of all exposed itemsbags into sealed clean bags i also need to clean my sofa  i dont even know how to remove bleach from a sofa  not to mention bleach will discolour clothesfabric  its a dark coloured sofa  \n\n\nswiggy thinks its safe for their customers to useeat products from the same bag as leaking bleach  they took zero responsibility for wasting my time effort ordering waiting for delivery talking to them on chatcall and cleaning the mess and health hazard they caused my wasted money or for potentially compromising the health of others like this  are these their companys quality of service standards and principles \n\n\nnote  i understand there must be people out there trying to cheat swiggy into giving them refunds but between groceries and food delivery i easily spend about rs 1400017000 per month on their app for years now very rarely raising issues \n\n\nlessons learnedfor everybody reading this \n1 please dont order toxic or harmful substances like harpicbathroom or toilet cleaners floor cleaners drain cleaners naphthalene balls dishwashing liquids etc from swiggy instamart since they use flimsy nonleak proof bags and dont segregate food items from chemical items while delivering i will only order groceries from bigbasket from now onwards\n2 atleast order food items and other things in seperate orders\n3 check the bags externally and refuse to take delivery in case of leakages since swiggy instamart will not take any responsibility in case of compromised products\n4 take pictures videos and record calls for proof in case you need to take legal action based on intensity of issue and your patience and faith in the legal system or for social media \n\n\nam i being unreasonable expecting swiggy to take responsibility here  it shocks me that they didnt take any actions to correct such a health hazard  \npictures attached zoom in to see pool of liquid bleach at bottom

us spent more than 14b this year during amazons 48hour sales event up 11 from a year ago according to adobe analytics amazon described this years prime day event as the the biggest prime day shopping event ever with record sales and more items sold during the twoday event than any previous prime day event the company also noted that a recordbreaking number of customers signed up for prime in the three weeks leading up to the event but it did not provide exact figures which is typical for amazon and why sales estimates always come from thirdparty analytic companies like adobe\n\nall those amazon prime day sales mentioned above  they come at a price fast company reports that prime day is the cause of a massive number of injuries for warehouse workers last week the senates health education labor and pensions committee released the interim results of a yearlong investigation into amazons warehouse conditions for workers according to internal data amazon reported more than 10 serious injuries per 100 workers and just under 45 total nonserious minor injuries per 100 workers the caveat to those numbers above is that the help committee argues that amazon misreported many injuries such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions as nonreportable because they failed to refer the workers to outside medical care even though they should have and that the actual number of osha reported injuries should be significantly higher\n\ndepop a peertopeer fashionfocused social commerce platform owned by etsy is eliminating seller fees for users in the us and shifting them to buyers

together\n\nthe us postal service was sharing the addresses and other personal information of its online customers with meta google microsoft pinterest and snap according to research by techcrunch

i paid for\n\nfeel cheated every time i order from swiggy instamart for the sake of convivence mutiple times they have either send bad quality products near expiry or straight up underweight produce supplied to them on their store by third party vendors moreover they have made their redressal system deliberately difficult to reach by call or by chat they ask you to email them proofs to save server costs and when supported by photovideo evidence they dismiss the issue by stating they are unable to  validate my claims and refuse to replace even forget refunding  \n\n\nevery time the issue is with one or more fresh produce items where the price of the item is mostly under 100 but the sour taste of being scammed like this is building up   \nhow is it that i have to bear the brunt of their failure to keep their vendors in check its like i am paying to give my feedback every time nothing changes and they continue on their merry way    \n\n\ni am advertised a certain premium rate quality and quantity on their app but then the delivered product is short on weight or quality or both if i am luck i understand quality is subjective and harder to prove with no benchmarks but in

an electrician to fix the issue and then narrated the whole sequence of this occurrence to them asking for a refund and wanting to give the product back\n\ntheir policy of needing a video for the concern we as users raise is nonsensical when i mentioned how sending in a video of plugging this device in would incur the same damages and require me to bear additional expenses again through no

around the jayanagar area the hub is located in jayanagar kr road and covers around 4km diameter including basavanagudi jayanagar nr colony srinagar gavipuram  banashankari and surrounding areas\n\nif youre ordering during heavy rains please avoid cash on delivery as the cash can get drenched easily during the travel despite wearing the raincoats and if the notes get damaged then it falls on the delivery persons head please use upi during pay on delivery\n\nif your place has no lift please try to avoid making the rider climb all the way up or atleast try to meet them half way on the stairs ive had people make me climb upto 4 th floor while just standing and staring while i was carrying two 10ltr water cans \n\na lot the richest looking people opt for the pay on delivery and pay us with mostly damaged notes where we have no choice but to collect the money its pathetic and please dont do that the only way for the riders to deposit cash is through a bank deposit and torn notes arent accepted through machines and we literally cant go stand in a line and deposit in a bank as we lose work hours \n\nmany people literally forget theyve ordered something and make us wait for more 30 minutes without picking the call for which swiggy penalises the rider if order gets delayed multiple times\n\nplease make sure the address and the location tagged is correct and please use the instruction box properly\none instance where someone from one of those swanky apartments opposite madhavan park had ordered something and put in no instructions and ordered from a different number when i called the number i got yelled at phone from that persons relative and then when i got to the door i got yelled again for not calling first and all the residents in that floor came in and yelled at me and treated me like some thief saying that delivery people are not allowed inside the apartment all that person couldve done is that put in instructions properly while ordering and there was no board infront of the gate\nso please please learn to use the delivery instruction box properly \n\ndogs as a pet lover i understand that my dog is obviously going to get hostile when someone new is about to enter the house so please if you have dogs please come near the gate and collect the order\n\nand this is not me guilt tripping people to leave tips or anything \nplease understand that the base pay if the distance is less than 1kms swiggy pays for instamart rider is 15rs per order and most of the delivery people have to work around 12 to 14 hours a day to make 1k a day theyre paid for the distance they ride not the number of floors they climb\n\nthis isnt me coming from a product manager perspective or marketing perspective this is me coming from a humanity perspective\nthe hub has around 80 riders for which there will be atleast 10 to 15 people present in the hub at a time and theres no seating area for the riders or a proper washroom facility and most of the public toilets are closed around 7pm and it costs 3rs to pee in a public toilet\nso the base pay is literally worth pissing a few times\n\nthese companies are built on the blood sweat and tears of the delivery partners so all i ask is a little bit of humanity from people\n  quick commerceinstant delivery is built on the principles of ultra cheap and readily available labour  this is the reason youd never see this work in us or eu with better equitable distribution of income \n\nthanks op for the honest account kudos to your writing skills\nthanks for this i urge everyone to at least  climb down the stairs or take a lift and collect the orders as we have to collect only one order but the delivery executive has to climb to at least 1520 homes in a day\n\nalso thanks for sharing this i saw a swiggy instamart guy riding his bike absolutely drenched in rain at 10 am this morning and i felt awful \n\nplease ride safe in the rain and stay safe cheers\naaaah\n\nsame old story with

who loves to cook but dont find much time these days due to a busy schedule i couldnt stop myself from posting about this product that i happened to order by chance when i was in kolkata through instamart they are instant liquid mixes so you dont have to do anything except for adding protein of your choice and cook ive only tried these two flavours and the taste is heavenly and has that exact

just add mutton with the liquid and cook instantly i first marinade the mutton with the mix and let it sit for six hours and then cook it in mustard oil  \n\nfor the mustard fish liquid a little goes a long way since it has a lot of jhaanjh and is spicy as well so the pack lasted for a week for me and i cooked four dishes borir jhaal shorshe bhindi chingri maach shorshe diye and prawn paturi with it the paste was good for a week in the fridge\n\nnext on my list is to try their chingri malaikari and champaran mutton paste\nthat kosha mangsho looks freaking delicious\nbere jinis mosai banie

gifts\nhardly anyone would want to try new items and that too from amazon\nyou only have 10 reviews which is again quite low\n\nmy suggestion create an insta page if not created till now make some viral reels partner with micro influencers and direct customers to your websiteamazon listing if you dont have a website\ngather more reviews\n\nif you can bid on keywords wrt dairy milk gifts cadbury or other relevant keywords  use helium  do that\nits because your cost of production is too high in a country that offers protein bars for 20 and chips packets for 10 at retail points you cannot grow a business in this segment unless youre creating a legacy brand pricing and promotions are your biggest enemies a majority of indian consumers like cheap things which is why d2c companies find it so difficult to make profits on premium products\n\nill be brutally honest with you unless someone is putting a significant amount of investment into this to fix your production line and supply chain your best bet would be to either treat this as a side hustle or close it down and focus on building a different kind of a company dont waste the time that you wont get back after 10 years\ni would like to help you with your insta have you tried marketing your chocolates as protein bars or comparing it with other same price category chocolate side by side in a post format or ad format i can help

fledged dropshipper like boat noise boult audio at this point with a 1000 employee team either way it is a very shitty business with a very small barrier to entry if these people stop marketing their products theyre unlikely to beat unilever with their game with brands such as lakm\u00e8 sunsilk glow  lovely glow  handsome clinic plus ponds clear and others\n\noutside of unilever theres lor\u00e8al maybelline vlcc and emami who can generate far better profitability and brand recall and inhouse cosmetics and rd spend on introducing new products\n\nmamaearth is like micromaxkarbonlava of cosmetics industry the point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as amazon or reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of noname low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as amazon basics solimo etc\nmamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products if you make subpar products you wont last in the market why would i buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available for any cosmetic brand if you dont have repeat customers you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it\nthe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from amazon\n\ni really dont understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy its share\n\nthey really dont have anything new or niche \nanywhere good luck to them and their individual investors\nhow can quick commerce be competition they sell through thay channel\n\nblinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nbaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so i doubt it will get any better\n\nthey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\ndirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of tapping into price conscious

a rating but over the years and across more than 900 orders on both platforms ive had my fair share of incidents\n\nmajor incidents\n\n1 a delivery associate once asked for 100 the order was already paid online and was worth more than 100 and elders ended up giving it swiggy somewhat understandably didnt do anything about it i havent ordered on cod since to ensure others dont get confused for which orders to pay or not\n2 a delivery associate stopped for fuel food and even servicing the vehicle which turned out to be a residential complex while on the way to deliver my order it took them over an hour to deliver a 3km order i initiated a call after noticing the delivery driver had taken a break of over 10 minutes they told me to cancel the order and claimed they were at a garage and will be unable to deliver a few minutes later i reported it to swiggy support who informed me that the order would be delivered in 5 minutes after calling the associate but it ended up taking another 40 when i later checked the locations screenshot on google maps it turned out to be a residential place not a garage as they claimed likely a stop to eat on their way from the house they also stopped at a fuel station in the end no compensation was provided for the delay\n\nminor issues\n\n torn packages with food intact\n food tossed around inside the packaging especially desserts\n leaking food happened only once\n order will be delivered on an ev but delivered on a splendor\n having to walk a few minutes to a lost driver\n\nrestaurants however have much more to improve on\n\n ignoring common cooking instructions eg dont make spicy dont add curry leaves etc\n delivering incorrect items including missing customized addons eg sour cream for tacos or ingredients listed for the dish eg no veggies in a veggie burger with many veggie ingredients listed for the second instance no veggies no refund was provided and was just told to rate the restaurant because they didnt accept their liability\n sending bad items eg burnt stale cold or poorly presented food while offering minimal refunds or denying liability altogether\n taking many minutes to accept an order a new scam on swiggy where restaurants delay acceptance to bypass the ontime guarantee eg if the guarantee is 20 minutes a 15minute delay in acceptance extends it to 35 minutes as the timer starts only after acceptance zeroing their liability for delays\n reduced quantity for online orders compared to offline orders at the same price some joins have extreme markups for online platforms\n excessive packaging charges eg 30100 on a 200 order making discounts pointless at some joints\n adding gst on top of gstinclusive items\n providing less quantity than advertised eg 300g listed but 220g delivered including packaging the aggregator swiggyzomato usually offers a small refund if weighed and reported\n misleading pictures that dont represent the delivered product one of the earliest scams\n improper packaging causing the food to arrive messy some people reportedly get refunds for this but ive never tried\n cancelled orders due to unavailable items which remain listed for a few minutes before being removed from the platform for some time an hour in my case but made available without the offers yet fully available on the competing platform with worse discounts\n\ndiscount inconsistencies\n\n discounts from some restaurants vary wildly eg 60 off most days but only 30 or lower on random days this seems to balance ordering ratings and revenue if unaware people recommend such joints to friends who then order with significantly worse discounts\n a few restaurants with good reviews seem to pump and dump offering massive discounts to build ratings in the early days later reducing or removing discounts altogether after having a bunch of positive reviews new uninformed customers unaware of prior discounts continue ordering although in smaller numbers than previously but with much higher profits for the restaurant all because of the ratings\n\nbonus  \nive had three instances where the order was marked as arrived at location much earlier than it was actually delivered on swiggy in all three cases i was asked to provide an otp im curious what this means for delivery guarantees does it count as arrived at location for those even if the driver is far from the location\n\ni almost always rate the delivery associates 5 stars regardless of navigation issues or delays what do you guys rate\n\nnext up ill cover instamart and platform issues of which there are many never order cod if the person ordering is not present to take the order delivery guys deliberately ask for more if elderly people receive the order and they may also shout and threaten elderly if they dont pay up immediately have read so many cases about this\nfake images in listings is not a swiggy scam you dont get shah rukh khan with lux and juhi chawla with taaza people know this for ages\n\npump and dump is a term used for an actual fraud what you are describing is a legit way how business

a news company and have been looking to write on swiggy and instamart with product delivery and its alleged ways to dupe its customers in various ways since its ipo would be lovely to know what the community thinks is primarily wrong with the company and is not being talked about enough\n\nps dms are open for anything swiggy happy to share few details one of my post on reddit went really viral and was covered by many media houses\n\nfew issues we as customer face are\n1 at certain times the product delivered  is either beyond expiry or is stale has moldfungus or infested this happens with both food and instamart orders\n2 non veg food is provided even though vegetarian product wad ordered\n3 listing issues where non vegetarian food is listed under vegetarian only items\n4 delivery issues where the delivery executive picked up the order and then switched off the phone or refuses to deliver the food\n5 delivery executive trying to takeover a customer account by initiating otp for login and once have access to it they change the phone number and email and then order bulk food and groceries at their preferred location with cash on delivery without payinghappy to share more information on this as this happened a while back with me and wife\n6 under weight items delivered vs promised weight\n\nearlier swiggy used to own all such issues and help out customers by either replacing items banning a restaurant or giving a full refund and used to charge a lot less ofcourse they wanted to onboard more customers and hence were helpful\n\nnow they charge high amount of different fees surcharge etc but when you report an issue there responses are\n1 swiggy is only an aggrigator use google to put in a negative review\n2 a user waiting for their food or groceries for few hours and support tells them they cannot cancel the order if cancelled all charges will be paid by user this too when delivery executive is not picking calls or refusing to deliver the order\n3 for underweight stale pest infested items missing items either refusing refund or giving partial refund which does not even matches the price of affected items\n\nthis will be a long list hence will leave it to others to add\nthank you for taking this up\nswiggy and zomato give lesser benefits to their most loyal customers \n\nrecently an asci study revealed that 52 out of 53 apps they examined had dark design patterns\n\n\n\nmany of us are familiar with the common dark patterns used by apps i want to list a few less obvious dark patterns\n\n\n\nvariable pricing the pricing for swiggy one and zomato gold varies from user to user the more frequently you order food the higher the price for you this is because the platforms are compensating for the loss of profit on delivery charges some users even have a negative score meaning they arent shown the option to buy zomato gold\n\n\n\nlimited options in bad weather if you buy swiggy one you might find yourself at a disadvantage during rainy weather which is common in bangalore when it rains youll be shown fewer restaurant options and many become undeliverable you can test this yourself the next time it rains many restaurants are available for nonswiggy one users but are not available for swiggy one users possibly due to the delivery charge\n\n\n\nincreasing prices at favorite restaurants the more often you order from your favorite restaurant the higher the prices become youll receive fewer discounts with each order\n\n\n\npacking charges charging 50 for packing is outrageous its robbery\ndelivery distance  i have a post here \nplatform fees what and why the heck is that even a thing  ill never know they already markup prices what is this fee for just look at the numbers theyll

nacglutathione supplements are popular in kerala they conceal the presence of two ingredients in with the help of a white sticker relevance to kerala in first paragraph fast  up is a very popular indian supplements company its products are used by runners athletes women and men who think it will clear up their skin and make them fairer people with respiratory problems nac dissolves mucus in your airways addicts to various things including pron drugs smoking etc and ocd and other mental disorders many sports groups in kerala drink their effervescent tablets after matches\n\nnacglutathione is definitely a good medicine you can buy and order it online without prescription but a popular company producing and selling it including on swiggys instamart fast  up is playing a dangerous game with our lives doctors say medicines should ideally be consumed as an oral tablet rather than an effervescent tablet an effervescent tablet is kept in a glass and water is poured in it bubbles up and after a couple of minutes we can drink it\n\ni used to take their products and noticed that it had a couple of sweeteners but since they were given in the form of numerical codes i didnt bother to google now they have started selling it with a white sticker covering the ingredients list i removed it and found their names maltodextrin and dextrose\n\nmaltodextrin is a synthetic substance made from rice corn and some other things it can be gmo in which case it should be avoided by people with digestive issues  \n  \ndiabetes it is highly processed and has a gi glycemic index higher than 100 some websites report it as between 105 and 130 the glycemic index of table sugar is only 75 so not only is this unhealthy for diabetics but it also puts non diabetics at risk it is absorbed into the blood stream at a rapid rate and this can potentially cause diabetes in the long term \n\nlays chips and many of its competitors all use maltodextrin to enhance the flavour if you take nac tablets every day you are spiking your blood levels once or twice a day depending on your frequency but if you eat a huge packet of lays chips full of maltodextrin then you will be spiking it much more almost everything we eat raises our blood sugar levels but things like maltodextrin are very bad since they cause sudden spikes\n\nobesity it is a simple carbohydrate and has no nutritional value therefore large doses can lead to obesity\n\nibd and bowel diseases our intestine contains both good and bad bacteria the good bacteria helps to maintain our mental health and keep our body in good condition maltodextrin kills off the good bacteria and increases the bad bacteria leading to gastroenteritis and inflammatory bowel disease with ibd you will not be able to drink milk and several foods you will also get bloody diarrhoea and constipation on a frequent basis this is an incurable disease but you can put it in remission until it comes back again flareup\n\ndoctors may also do colonoscopy you will have to get naked and they will stick a device up your rectum and go deep into your intestine\n\nhowever multiple recent studies have shown detrimental roles played by maltodextrin in the intestinal environment suggesting that this broadly used food additive may play a role in the rapid increased incidence of chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome in this issue of\u00a0cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology laudisi et\u00a0al1\u00a0add a new line to this list of evidences with the investigation of the impact of maltodextrin on murine models of colitis by using 2 different models of colitis the investigators found that consumption of maltodextrin exacerbated intestinal inflammation in a dosedependent manner mechanistically such detrimental effects of maltodextrin were linked to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent alterations of the protective mucus layer importantly pharmacologic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress was sufficient to prevent maltodextrininduced intestinal inflammation and associated depletion in the mucus layer1\n\n  \n\n\ngas diarrhoea bloating can be caused by high doses of maltodextrin avoid processed foods such as chips and nutrition bars many popular foods contain maltodextrin\n\nsources \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\ndextrose is a very high glycemic index sweetener it is also used as a preservative diabetics may keep a dextrose tablet with them so that if their blood sugar falls too low and they are about to faint chewing the tablet will cause a huge increase in sugar levels this is what fast and up includes in their products\n\nyou are at increased risk of diabetes obesity and even heart and kidney disease due to the high sugar content your kidneys will get stressed excreting them it can also cause fatty liver disease and insulin resistance\n\n\n\nmaybe an athlete will need these sweeteners to increase their energy levels drastically and therefore it is suitable for them but many people with sedentary lifestyles such as elderly respiratory disease patients and children definitely dont need it   \n  \nthey can buy nacglutathione tablets in tablet form only not effervescent tablet it wont be sweet and it actually smells like shit but you dont need to bite it just swallow it with a glass of water and you are good to go it will detoxify your lungs and liver and make your life better and thats because those tablets dont have maltodextrin and dextrose our countrys drug and supplement regulation is terrible anyone can fill chalk powder capsules and sell them through pharmacies and no one from the regulatory agency will bat an

mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n namaste\nthanks for submitting to

experience\n\nf1 really laughs a good experience\n\nme well they have all come out smiling so i am assuming their experience has been good \n\nf1 smiling so what are your expectations\n\nme since i am the last candidate i am hoping you take it easy on me everyone laughs\n\nm1 so how good is your math\n\nme to be honest sir i have lost touch with math\n\nm2 pretends to be shocked how will you survive in iimc then we are very focused on math\n\nme its not like i cannot do math sir i have studied it at an engineering level its just that i have lost touch with it because it wasnt in the curriculum post second year and i did not need it in my work\n\nm1 what about cat\n\nme sir i had a specific strategy for cat i wanted to maximise my strengths and so i focused on dilr and varc i backed whatever i knew in math from 10th 11th and 12th and it worked out for me\n\nf1 so ai is the latest buzzword can you explain what type of ai is chatgpt\n\nme explained about generative ai and how it works\n\nf1 have you heard the term naturalness in ai\n\nme no maam but i can give it a shot f1 motions me to go on naturalness is how similar to a human an ai can beg in its responses\n\nf1 do you know if there is a test for naturalness\n\nme is it something to do with the accuracy of the model\n\nf1 no but thats okay maybe you can go back and read about it can you tell me what is the difference between ai and agi\n\nme no clue about it blabbered about agi being able to generate responses related to overall general awareness and ai making predictions instead of generating responses\n\nf1 no thats not it do you know the fullform of agi\n\nme artificial generative intelligence \n\nf1 no artificial general intelligence\n\nm2 so i see you have done some courses here can you tell me what is a stack and queue\n\nme explained about stack and queue data structures and the concepts of fifo and lifo\n\nm2 you have also done a course on financial statement analysis do you know in inventory management the principle of lifo is applied can you tell me why\n\nme blanking completely at this point pushing out newer batches to the consumer can extend their shelf life as it is not close to expiry\n\nm2 then what happens to the earlier batches\n\nme they are also pushed out to consumers but its upto the retailer on how they choose to sell those products gave an example of bread being closer to expiry being sent on swiggy instamart\n\nm2 can you think of why changing from lifo to fifo inventory management system can cause auditor to raise concerns\n\nme the auditor might not be satisfied with the quality of product being sent out since it might be close to expiry\n\nm2 consumer is still getting the product can you think of something else\n\nme maybe some human error creeps in and there is a number mismatch\n\nf1 so you have mentioned you are a voracious reader can you tell me what books you read\n\nme breathing easier now my preferred genres are historical fiction and fantasy\n\nf1 talk about your favourite books in historical fiction\n\nme spoke about song of achilles\n\nf1 what about fantasy\n\nme spoke about throne of glass\n\nf1 in fantasy we have this term high fantasy can you explain what that is\n\nme explained what high fantasy is\n\nm2 interrupting what does your name mean\n\nme it means famous and its another name for lord vishnu\n\nm2 can you tell me then 10 avatars of vishnu\n\nme only knew 3\n\nm2 only 3 thats it are you not interested in indian mythology\n\nme no sir thats not the case its just that i havent gotten a chance to

will not refund even a penny regardless of how big your order was \n\nhats off to such an ethical standard set by these unicorns i am boycotting swiggy as of today i will go buy food from local shops  buy groceries myself or starve if i dont have a choice  but i am not giving a single penny to these looters i think its not their fault as they have already mentioned it that you wont get any refund in case of cancellation you shouldnt blame them for choosing the incorrect address imo\nin such a case you should call the delivery guy and offer to pay him to come drop it to your correct address ive done it a few times on zomato and swiggy but my addresses were within 78km radius\nor if you had ordered to a friends house could have gotten it delivered there and gotten it picked up by

season premiere\n\nwe received confirmation that our episode would air on march 29th the season finale however on the 28th they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation\n\nthis news was devastating based on the confirmation email we had shipped nearly rs 15 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country perishable products with a shelf life of just 34 months\n\nsince then ive relentlessly tried contacting the shark tank team they didnt respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month weve even secured a no objection certificate noc from bahubali film producer shobu yarlagadda addressing any themerelated concerns\n\nmy requests are simple air the pitch or feature it in the unseen pitches segment on youtube as done in previous seasons out of 150 pitchers im the only one fateful\n\nfrustrated were desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with blinkit instamart and zepto but for a small brand moving rs 15 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge\n\nwe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency the same is expected from a platform like shark tank india all i

first startup and i plan to make it successful as i am bootstrapped by myself and my savings \n\nany input would be greatly appreciated thanks  i was going through your responses and realised you were keen on going heavy on social media this is a common strategy for d2c brands in a crowded space however there will be competitors with deep pockets due to external funding which can turn out to be in your favour let me explain\n\ni have recently shifted from corporate to start my own independent agency and through that i have consulted a few d2c brands that were recently funded the one thing every founder is eager to do is run paid ads \n\ni have seen good ideas turn into a disaster because founders marketed their products too early   \n  \nthus if you can identify your niche take your time to really understand your customer and create a targeted plan for reaching that customer slowly but surely you can achieve success  \n  \nbut the journey will be long and you will have to grind in silence an often overlooked thing is that founders who receive funding are often put into the limelight which acts as a motivational factor at times it takes greater courage and determination to build something in silence and keep improving every day\n\nmy close friend built a 100 million dollar saas company completely bootstrapped and it took him 4 excruciatingly long years of grinding but it was worth it for him\n\nmy team has been asking me to create a pdf on the topic the ultimate d2c ecommerce checklist before you start paid marketing maybe i can dm it to you once its ready\n\nall the best
