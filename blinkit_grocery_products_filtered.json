quick commerce landscape in 2024 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 the rapid growth seen in the quick commerce business has compelled zomato to double down on blinkit it is looking to nearly double its store count by the end of fy25 \n\n\ud83d\udd38 mukesh ambaniled ril is close to launching its own quick commerce operations through jiomart  looking to deliver groceries in select cities in under 30 minutes and is likely to ramp up operations by next year \n\n\ud83d\udd38 reliance reportedly plans to take it to around 1000 cities in future and jiomart will tap into reliance retails network of over 18000 stores across the country\n\n\ud83d\udd38 that kind of scale would allow jiomart to potentially catapult the existing group of quick commerce apps  blinkit swiggys instamart and zepto  and also end the nascent ambitions of tataowned bigbasket and flipkart before they take off\n\n\ud83d\udd38 flipkart is fresh with funds from google and majority stakeholder walmart and is also likely to make a major push for grocery delivery where blinkit zepto and swiggy have created welloiled playbooks","3":"i recently came back to hometown patna and very surprised and upset to see that there is still no grocery app is delivering in this city yet no blinkit no swiggy insta mart only one that is bigbasket and my experience with them is so bad here as they never deliver fresh items i also tried to look for healthy alternatives like multigrain breads or non veg veg salad options again only one brand is there that too never available online i mean this is so upsetting to see that people here are still not getting rich healthy options available online i wish to see this city growing in terms of healthy living cleanliness more job oriented ","4":"i started this collection back in 2022 when i was in 10th grade\narranged from favourite to least favourite right to left\n\n1 hotwheels car smells kinda metallic and rusty 0 performance its my favourite as it looks very cool\n\n2 pendora scents noir en leather clone of tom fords ombre leather got it yesterday for 1k from a friend who didnt like it and used it only twice it might be a bit too early to call this my favourite i know but it smells so damn good to me \nopening kind of spicy with the main note of cardamomelaichi this doesnt last very long though\ndry down rich and syntheticbut in the best way possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance very pleasant not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather\n\n5 jaguar classic black\nmy daily go to got it for 24k on blinkitzeptoi dont remembervery generic and mass pleasing cant really put my hand on what notes it uses but its fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge great summer frag but can be used all year round moderate performance the bottle is so dishevelled because i keep it in my bag for school everyday\n\n6 ajmal silver shade \ni use it sometimes when i get bored of jaguar got it for 12k on zepto fresh citrusy and metallic cant go wrong with this also ive heard its a clone of creeds silver mountain water but idk how far thats true performance is decent same as jaguar classic black \n\n7 decant of beardo whiskey smoke\nfriend gave this to me for free spicy winter frag pretty mid tho dont use it much nothing else to say here\n\n8 villain edp\nthis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 i used to love this and i finished a whole bottle of it within a year sweet dark and fresh smelling but this new bottle just isnt as strong and performace sucks barely lasts 30 minutes idk if they changed its formulation or what its just not the same anymore the only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia \n\n9 adidas ice dive\ngot gifted this by my cousins smell is pretty decent fresh citrusy and sporty wouldve been ranked way higher if it performed barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection\n\n10 ustra scuba cologne\nthis is the only fragrance in my collection i actually despise supposed to be fresh and aquatic but its just synthetic harsh and a complete mess literally nothing to like abt it dont waste ur money on this","5":"\nhey everyone need some help to optimise my card collection\n\nmajor monthly spends\n\nrent

delhi ncr last year\n\ncons  \n1 little to no weekend getaway options 23 din ki chutti mil jaye get so confused ki kya karein bencho\n2 not a con as suggested correctly by several in comments far away from hometown for people from north have to plan and spend about 50k on travel plans alone by flight or if by train be ready to spend 45 days on travel alone\n3 north indian sweets are less in options those selling dont have the same taste id almost kill for om sweets ki rabri rasmalai the best desi sweet of all times period\n4 the traffic is a nightmare but its similar to gurgaon if not worse also brings it to a standstill after heavy rains more of an indian metro issue than just hyd\n5 never faced any water issues in the whole north india here specially the new city area hitech city was a barren land so come peak summers very significant water problem have to completely rely on water tankers which adds up to rent costs\n6 gated society flat rent and buy rates are eye watering much high than delhi nsr but there is also a positive mentioned in pros below\n7 ola and uber demand far exceeds the supply and forget uber or ola money never put balance in it instead keep upi handy every damn auto or bike guy has a qr code ready with them or keep cash but upi is of course more convenient you have to have at least a 2wheeler for your convenience peak hours mein its a pain to get an auto or even a bike public transport is very bad old rickety lopsided buses\n8 flouting traffic rules is the past time of hyderabad go to old hyderabad and you will see more people without helmets than with i used to be pissed off at every wrong side no helmet rider but have learned to be more careful and patient myself and accept this lawlessness lol\n\npros  \n1 the weather is hot till may then it starts raining cats and dogs from june so no heat till next year march cant imagine a single night without ac in june or july in the north\n2 a heaven for foodies the non veg kind specially the biryani the curries and the andhra cuisine is excellent\n3 tha cafe and restaurant options are unlimited and varied the cafe culture is excellent you can go to a local cafe and enjoy talking with your friends for hours imagine a more accessible and unpretentious starbucks experience in almost any residential locality \n4 local bakeries are very nice have a good sale so the produce is fresh i have stopped ordering bread from blinkit\n5 the dhinchak dakhini hindi dialect is commonly used and the assholery like bangalore is not here yes forcing others to learn a language unless they themselves feel the need due to issues in communicating by abusing northerners in an auto cab or anywhere outside is plain assholery in my book so you can easily live here if you know hindi\n6 you can wear whatever the fuck you want 365 days a year i have seen fully burka clad and short skirt wearing ladees in my office and have purposefully tried to see if any men are leering at the skirt wali grills honestly out of 10 only 1 or 2 stare which is saying a lot compared to the way majority would rpe with eyes in delhi ncr \n7 you can eat whatever whenever the fuck you want no closing of meat selling businesses for whole weeks or months people hindus and muslims both will come on street if there is any ban on buying or selling any kind of food we love our food and the freedom to eat it\n8 politically they hate bjp and congress equally hate congress because majority hyderabadis being brs fanbois and congress won from the semi urban and rural telangana and have heard big electricity cuts in several places in hyd since they came to power bjp because they see whats happening in the north and dont want it to happen in hyderabad\n9 very safe city girls can roam around in late evening without fear of eve teasing or worse\n10 it is also a pretty clean city not in the leagues of indore chandigarh etc but much cleaner than the whole delhi ncr\n11 i said gated society rent and buy rates are eye watering but people majorly live in standalone building with ease this is because of bare minimum crime rates one can live with family in a standalone building with peace of mind cant even think of the same in gurgaon\n\nall in all this is honestly the countrys best metro right now i plan to settle completely have my kids assimilate into the culture learn telugu my kids and i and become native

fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money","14":"hi\u00a0recommerce\u00a0 im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce

man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly

demarcate if your order will be delivered by amazon fresh or amazon i have always had terrible experience with amazon fresh and hence never used to order from amazon fresh lately i have learnt that the so called rush delivery whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by amazon fresh\n\ntwice i opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so called rush deliveries are handled by amazon fresh i then realized why they were getting delayed amazon fresh has always been crap since day 1 the worst part is they wont even let you cancel an amazon fresh order even if it has not been dispatched \n\nso if you are ordering something from amazon never choose any of the time slots your order will be then handled by amazon fresh and you will be sorry you chose them\n\nas a side note always check the item on blinkit before ordering from amazon their sku has expanded significantly the order which was delayed by amazon fresh i checked it on blinkit and got it in 5 minutes meanwhile the original

and my combined across all cards monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net inhand salary despite still not having an outstanding cibil score 725  i configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that i dont overspend and my lost card liability is reduced to an extent if god forbid that ever happens i dont have any missed payment history avoided bnpls no emi purchases even when there is a lucrative offer avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases of liabilities such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds andor settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs but not all of my wants\n\nx200b\n\nepilogue\n\ni still have mostly ltf cards i remember an amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 bangalore airport lounge visit about to start his wellrehearsed sales pitch before which i interjected  you wont have my attention unless you say its ltf for now i have stayed put with that strategy with tata neu plus being the only exception owing to the fact that my core cards are already ltf even if my core cards get devalued i wont have to reassess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joiningannualinactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements i have also stayed away from credit card offerings from psus  reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch sbi card is an exception in terms of digitialization but it doesnt fulfill the ltf criteria and i dont see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio i am fine to be suboptimal here and take a 0515 hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which i will happily redirect elsewhere\n\nneedless to say i am pretty thankful of both  this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom reviews updates news hacks and what not for the current and future indian credit card holders i hope the community continues to blossom and i am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments","34":"i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that","35":"","36":"","37":"hi guys\n\ni am launching a new venture to help d2c brands offer 3060 minute deliveries directly

expenses when you know what your expenses are you can maximize your sales growth \n\ncash position\n\nthe companys current assets are greater than its current liabilities which is a good sign also the company is continuously investing in rd and acquiring the rights to new products like horlicks vwash etc\n\nannual report of fy 2021\n\nthe lockdown affected many companies in 2020 but hul did the best during the pandemic it had acquired vwash and also horlicks by merging with gsk\n\nmerger with gsk\n\nthe products which hul has in their portfolios are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmost of the

frozen fruit as a product in india and its market post 1 link \n\n\n\nso yesterday i tried to do it in a home freezer just to try it with flavours textures and feel of a frozen fruit\n\ni got kiwi and dragon fruit\n\ni cut them into beautiful small cubes added 4 flavours \n\n1 dairy milk chocolate which i melted and put few drops over the cube \n2 honey\n3 red chillies and salt\n4 lime \n\nand put them into freezer \n\nafter few hours i tried them the one with dairy milk was awesome i liked honey one too \n\nchilies were too much and lime was there or not i have no clue because kiwi was sour maybe off season or something\n\noverall noted few things \n\n1 you cant eat frozen fruit directly it just like an ice cream difference is you lick ice cream most of the time or its creamy but fruit is like an ice cube it was hard have to give some time to eat after putting them out of freezer\n\n2 so i got some 20 pieces overall because i wanted to get taste test done from my family members and as we were eating and discussing they started to melt again weather problem india is too hot and humid \n\n3 add on flavours started to melt away as well\n\n4 although fruit was able to maintain there texture and taste plus point so it does increase shelf life if done properly\n\n5 cutting a fruit properly to maintain equal size is difficult and time consuming and as well it creates wastage \n\n6 dragon fruit is a f tasteless fruit not the first time eating it i am having it since childhood and kiwi is moslty sour \n\nit doesnt mean i am giving up on the idea i will do some more rd and with basic fruit as well kiwi and dragon fruit is kinda expensive as well not widely available or likeable fruit in india \n\ni ordered frozen strawberry too it was available on blinkit and it was tasteless i love strawberries i eat them a lot but it was hard to consume it was more suitable for smoothie or as toppings thats why most brand do only berries as frozen fruit \n\ni will try again with the sample in few weeks with full research this time and preparation and hopefully come up with crazy combos and ways to make it more flavourful and easy to bite \n\nif you have any suggestions

which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n","97":"\n\nhi guys i created an app shopswiftly where you can compare prices of multiple products available on platforms like instamart blinkit

venture in the unknown but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche yet in the grand scheme of things it can be a brilliant productservice users probably dont know they needed it but they do if its executed correctly\n\ni have been building a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading

creator marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower count\n\nthe ftc adopted a click to cancel rule last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships additionally businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions

shippo and shipstation will be the only thirdparty shipping services to be offered on the website this means that other providers like pirate ship easyship and shippingeasy will no longer be offered

tissues indeed any capitalist society thrives on how quickly obsolete things can become so that new things can be bought to take their place now extend this idea to all facets of the human experience namely the entire system of objects and our relationships we can categorise  from things to socialfamilial institutions to ideas to places and of course to ourselves\nwe are living in an age of disposability situationships are disposable relationships selfies are disposable photographs if you dont like one take another people often claim that this is a generation of authenticity i disagree this is a generation of curated authenticity keep trying to be authentic till you get it just right\nthere is a dc supervillain called clay face he can change his looks and demeanour at will far from being a gift this is depicted as a curse in having the ability to become temporarily everyone he truly is permanently no one a disposable identity one might say\nthere was a time when for better or worse identity was defined by the circumstances of ones birth a blacksmiths son would be a blacksmith a tanners child would be a tanner and a priests child would be a priest i will not get into the intersectionality and issues of gender as a basis for identity to keep this discuss on point\nbut capitalism gave rise to the need for mobility and geographical mobility also necessitated social mobility our identity was not defined by where we came from but rather what we did and what we did allowed us to buy brands so as the traditional notions of identity fell away we started identifying ourselves then by conspicuous consumption someone who could afford expensive stuff was richer and rich people were rich because as capitalism assumed they were more productive and therefore of more use to society\nbut now conspicuous consumption is democratised access and accessibility both have been solved for in this era we define ourselves not by conspicuous consumption but by conspicuous

travelling but not sure if i get an esim dual physical sim is nice\n recommendations for a food app is there a noon groceries like in dubai or a blinkit like in india\n will probably look at bookingcom any other recommendations\n what cities are nice to visit i dont want to rent motorbike if there is a driver maybe that is better for me\n is 1k a month a good budget to enjoy can be flexible but rather be ultra low expenses for 13 month while i try to launch my product","139":"hey my cousin is coming to delhi and has a gluten allergy please recommend me some good stores which has gluten free bread  pasta and snacks i browsed blinkit but kuch mila nhi  and koi gluten free restaurant bhi recommend krdo","140":"i have ordered chicken from blinkit and when i get it i get some foul smell and see the packaging to see it packed on 25 novermber 2023  a two months back packet with expiry on 28 november 2023 what should i doi have filed a complaint at national consumer forum other than that  any lawyers that can suggest on legal ways to proceed can a fir be filed apparently after browsing through twitter i have found that blinkit is guilty of serving expired products repeatedly and doesnt respond back how do they constantly get away with such things\n\nps im sorry if this isnt relevant to this sun but didnt know where else to post thanks","141":"hen fruit farm white eggs i have ordered this eggs from blink it and swiggy twice or trice and you con see yourself on the video smell is disgusting \ud83e\udd22 ive tried to contact blinkit but they need a live time video im in fucking rage this mother fuckers are taking our money for tho quality im disgusted this is sos terribleplease help me to report this company \n","142":"so i am one of the younger members of this sub ill turn 18 in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here","143":"\nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar ","144":"what is this city mannow haters will all try to go against me like who am i to say how is this city and all but trust me it is way too fcked than anyone can ever imagine renaming can never change any of its downfall man  this city is developing downwards fs  half the places on google maps are not even registered  5070 of people are uncultured and too conservative and old style as if its early 2000s thats going on no sign of proper modernisation and forget about night life  its been a year i came in here and all i realised is this city is best for killing your social life  no friends no social life  no dating and what not  which on the contrary destroys my mental peace and yea this is to be blamed to this city indeed  i mean see the condition of city buses  auto man charges kidney level prices for just 200300m ahead of some chowk drop point and what not i mean this city is more costly to stay and live in than nearest metro cities atleast there are cheap public transport services well maintained food and delivery systems and what not  and what i get here is either pay way to extreme than imagination for quality life and food or just for urself with whatever tf u have i mean i literally thought being a semiurban city could be a really good and developing one but since covid what i have noticed is this city is getting fcked and fcked over which makes me wonder the situation of it post 23 years from now  all chappris taking over and what not my life feels hell here without any friends in college  no social life and wasting all this money here for better lifestyle which makes me feel i mean why am i even alive like tf dude  kuch nahi chalta yaha na blinkit hai  na zero broker hai  na like basic things for a normal lifestyle hai  i see and talk with my old friends who settled in metro cities and look at their life and compare it with mine and realise like wtf did i

remember the expost but people were arguing about which place is better than other\n\nwell i shifted from bangalore to bhubaneswar on 1st july after staying there for 3 years\n\nhere are some observations\n\npros of living in bangalore\n1 fast paced life people work hard and you do the same\n2 you see successful people there and that helps you work harder too\n3 you get a better pay over there\n4 the weather is \u2764\n5 the language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\ncons of living in bangalore\n1 the city kind of lost its heart you dont get too many people ready to help you hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers\n2 too many ways to lose money whether its the convenience of zepto blinkit or the expensive goods over there you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nbut bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\npros\n1 the heart i never lived in bhubaneswar my hometown is in keonjhar the can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved

The point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as Amazon or Reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of no-name low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as Amazon Basics, Solimo etc.\nMamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products. If you make subpar products you won't last in the market. Why would I buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available. For any cosmetic brand, if you don't have repeat customers, you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it.\nThe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from Amazon.\n\nI really don't understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy it's share.\n\nThey really dont have anything new or niche. \nAnywhere good luck to them and their individual investors.\nHow can quick commerce be competition, they sell through thay channel\n\nBlinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nBaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so I doubt it will get any better\n\nThey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\nDirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of tapping into price conscious market\nProfit kamaye Mera L.

It's an easy\/logical \"NO\" from them. \n\nIn reality, it's a double edged sword. Airbnb and Uber both started with tiny TAMS and found ways to grow into massive businesses. Coca-Cola expanded their TAM once they started to view themselves as a FnB company, not just a soda company. \n\nBut it's hard to build a big business with a non-existent TAM. You should run some numbers...what is a reasonable SOM (obtainable market)? How big can that business be? \n\nThen you need a story on how you'll expand into a larger TAM.\nUnderstanding your TAM is important, as is your unit economics.\u00a0\n\nDo you want to build a startup, as opposed to just starting a business (where you don\u2019t need to raise capital and don\u2019t intend to hire more than a handful of people)?\n\nIf you want to build a startup your TAM needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage, but not too big that there\u2019s a tonne of competition.\n\nYour unit economics need to stack up against the TAM. In your example let\u2019s say there\u2019s a pool of 1M people, that would pay $30 twice a year to try a new tech toy. Your TAM is 60M.\n\nThis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 30-50% of the market.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at unit economics required to win millions of customers \u2026 eg. you\u2019d be getting $60 per customer per year, but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer?\u00a0You probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers. What\u2019s it cost to get your ad in front of a million people?\n\nAnd then how long do they stay a customer? Eg what is the LTV.\n\nWe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework you\u2019re in the low importance, low frequency box. This is the worst box to be in.\n\nSo it\u2019s a small TAM, high cost of customer acquisition, high churn \u2026\u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions.\n\nSo would I get hung up on TAM? No, but if the TAM is small you want the other factors to be good. If everything is bad, then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea.\nDepending on what stage of the startup you\u2019re on, tam\u2019s can work. However, the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if you\u2019re revenue model makes sense and you\u2019re able to show low acquisition costs, high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real TAM assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe SOM however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular - its really the calculation of what if any the Series A will look like\n\nat early stage $1 should get you something stupid like $1 in revenue, if they are asking for $1M seed to hit $1M in revenue, you have a Series A candidate, if their SOM is something bigger like $100M and all they need is $5 M preseed but the don't have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their SOM is $1M but need $2M to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nThe TAM for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\nCLTV and CAC are probably a much more telling exercise than the TAM SAM SOM\n\nBTW nearly 90% of our \"no's\" are based on our assessment of a weak founding team. 9% of our \"no's\" are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand (call back when you get some) 1% may include the TAM discussion posited in the post\nNeed to know TAM as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale. Easier to be a $100m company with a TAM of $100b than a TAM of $200M.\n\nBut in reality, TAM is very easy to manipulate and enlarge. If you are airBnB, you may have picked the private B&B market as your TAM. But the expand to private short-term rentals and TAM is much bigger. Then expand into hotels and it\u2019s huge. Now go global.\n\nTo me, a TAM is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything.\n\nI am working on an AI + human chat service\/platform. I am broadening the focus to service, support and sales. That expands potential market significantly. Then adding a human layer, likely means I can also cater to enterprise so from SMB to large enterprise. I am actually too broad and need to sort this out. But TAM is helpful.","100":"[removed]","101":"big basket .. is working , it delivers within 10 mins\nBig basket helps me out.

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \"advanced\" countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \"advanced\" countries.\n\n2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\n\n3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\n\n4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can't predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.\n\n5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM\n\n6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.\n\n7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, \"politically correct\" types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by \"leftism\" will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)\n\n8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there doesn't seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call \"feelings of inferiority\" and \"oversocialization.\" Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.","115":"","116":"When I buy veggies and fruits, I out a lot of care and attention to pick the good ones.

I used to cross IIT-B everyday once upon a time for few years \ud83d\ude05\n\n2) given how ncr and Mumbai have been built, it is tendency to like one city and not the other but not both.  Opinion is split normally. \n\nFor me if someone can take care of my housing in Mumbai I will shift there tonight.\nI have lived in many cities in India. \n\nOf course Delhi. Then Jaipur. Mumbai. Kolkata. Bhubaneswar. Pune. Bangalore. These are the cities where is spent at least 6 months ot more. Many other cities where I spent less time so not mentioning them. \n\nGurgaon (at least the one on this side of the highway - which excludes the Old Gurgaon), is a very very competitive urban agglomeration vs others in India. \n\nI think Ahmedabad and Hyderabad may be better and Mumbai and Bangalore in parts. \n\nBut overall, Gurgaon has all the elements of urban living - good school, great hospitals, good shopping scene, restaurants, communities are now coming up through huddle etc. The career opportunities is what makes it stand out in North India. \n\nYes, it doesn\u2019t have a cultural fingerprint as it is a primarily immigrant settled city, but I think with time it will find it. It\u2019s only 20 years old if we are being fair. 30 max. Let\u2019s give it another 2 decades. \n\nNoida is just too \u201csterile\u201d.

Bombay has a much much larger diaspora of South Indians, and in Gurgaon is close to none. As a South Indian (who was born and raised in Bangalore) and living in Gurgaon since the past 2 years now, the South Indian food from Naivedyam or Sagar Ratna is NOT EVEN CLOSE to South Indian food. \n\nI think you just like the taste of South Indian food made by these mainstream restaurants.\neveryone likes where they were born and brought up, there's always a soft spot for the homeland, kiddo. \n\ni lived 19 years of my life in nepal, kathmandu, moved to india for uni and job, it's been 8 years and yet i miss kathmandu and the food there equally how i used to miss em in my initial days comin here. not only the food, i miss everything actually.\nIn my experience, people are better there, doesnt have a showoff culture and place is much secure.

After burning the VC capital. There would be no more discounts. Than, only dmart would be able to provide at MRP or below MRP purely due to it's scale and margins. Quick commerce can never provide below MRP without VC capital.\nOkay. \nA few points. Zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the VC Money to figure out the following \n1) Dark store penetration and expansion. In areas where dark stores aren't profitable ie Minimum order value on a daily basis that's where the VC MONEY handle the loss\n2) the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms. \n3) cost of delivery \n4) Marketing and ads to promote the platform (but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands)\n\nThey DO NOT PAY for the discounts. NOT ONE CENT\n\nThere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category.  But usually they don't. \n\nI have worked in KAM roles in multiple brands. The model is simple. If I have a product A who's MRP is say 100 rs. \nI pay zepto a fix margin. So 30% (norm. It's higher for blinkit). So they pay me only 70rs. So i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nSo take case of discounts. They put it for say 80rs. So instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer. So they balance it 100-80 = 20. They raise a debit note agaisnt it. And the brand has to pay it back.\n\nNot only that. The banners. The placement on top of search for keyword search. Everything is monetized. \n\nSo zeptos net profit is = margin from brands(30%avg) + Banners and marketing placements - cost of dark stores and delivery -tech cost - any marketing (ads and extra coupons)\n\nSo the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter. Blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs (new brands are asked for as high as 55%) and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs. Also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low.\n\nHave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions. But most discounts are borne at the source.\nQuick commerce is made for the growing riches in india, while India will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class, Dmart and Zepto both are not going anywere I think (only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth)\nPeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators. Look where we are now. Food for thought?\nHow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years? Brosky India has infinite cheap labour, it\u2019ll become profitable sooner or later.","144":"Bro bashing his head on concrete wall and neither hoping for a waterfall to emerge.\nTbh Cannaught bhi chhapri ho gaya hai\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\nIdhar hum log chai sutte pe vibe karte hai and our night life is our dhabas with great food and best of the times with our buddies.

But butcher shop can be cost effective. You can even make a deal with them, if you buy regularly. \n2) Make sure it's an alive chicken they are butchering, for quality. If you are eating everyday, you can have 150 GM of chicken(Calculate your protein req, and remove other protein sources). Problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces. Instead get 500 gm of chicken breast. I guess, there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm. Ask them not to chop it. (Chicken breast is a good source of lean protein)\n\n3) It's feasible if you use freezer. Go for 500 gm in the beginning. Adjust it as you go.\n\n4) This is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked. a) Always cook on low flame. b) Use non stick pan(atleast in the beginning) and make sure to close it with the lid while cooking (Trust me: It makes all the difference) c) I make chicken tandoori, and the marinade makes it soft. d) When it's juicy and glazed with far, you know your chicken is ready.

Ajmal silver shade: \nI use it sometimes when I get bored of jaguar. Got it for 1.2k on zepto. Fresh, citrusy and metallic. Can't go wrong with this. Also I've heard it's a clone of creed's silver mountain water but idk how far that's true. Performance is decent, same as jaguar classic black. \n\n7. Decant of beardo whiskey smoke:\nFriend gave this to me for free. Spicy winter frag. Pretty mid tho. Don't use it much. Nothing else to say here\n\n8. VILLAIN edp:\nThis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 I USED TO LOVE THIS and I finished a whole bottle of it within a year. Sweet, dark and fresh smelling. But this new bottle just isn't as strong and performace sucks. Barely lasts 30 minutes. Idk if they changed its formulation or what. It's just not the same anymore. The only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia. \n\n9. Adidas ice dive:\nGot gifted this by my cousins. Smell is pretty decent. Fresh, citrusy and sporty. Would've been ranked way higher if it performed. Barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection.\n\n10. Ustra Scuba cologne:\nThis is the only fragrance in my collection I actually DESPISE. Supposed to be fresh and aquatic. But it's just synthetic, harsh and a complete mess. Literally nothing to like abt it. Don't waste ur money on this.","5":"Help needed to optimise cards and rewards  \nHey everyone, need some help to optimise my card collection.\n\nMajor Monthly Spends:\n\nRent: \u20b915k\n\nTravel: \u20b910k (flights or train), \u20b92k (fuel)\n\nElectricity: \u20b95k\n\nFood & Groceries: \u20b910k (Swiggy, Instamart, Blinkit, FreshToHome, etc.)\n\nOccasional Amazon Purchases\n\nRestaurant Dine-outs, movie tickets\n\nOne International Trip per Year\n\nCurrent Credit Cards:\n\n1.

So after a long, long time, I finally had the time and motivation for some skincare and haircare. I'm in my final year of college, and it has been *so* stressful these past couple of months, which was taking a toll on my skin. I decided to refill my skincare stash and got some new items as well! :)\n\nI\u2019ve been using the hair products for two weeks now, so feel free to ask me anything about those. I kind of ordered them on a whim from Blinkit\u2014it was an impulse buy. I could have gotten a better deal, but I was so frustrated with my hair that day and needed them immediately, lol.\n\nThe skincare products are mostly refills, so ask me anything about those as well. :) Below are the prices and the sites I bought them from.

Am from the north, shifted from Delhi NCR last year.\n\nCons - \n1. Little to no weekend getaway options. 2-3 din ki chutti mil jaye, get so confused ki kya karein bencho.\n2. (Not a con as suggested correctly by several in comments) Far away from hometown (for people from North), have to plan and spend about 50k on travel plans alone by flight. Or if by train, be ready to spend 4-5 days on travel alone.\n3. North Indian sweets are less in options, those selling dont have the same taste. I'd almost kill for Om Sweets ki rabri rasmalai, the best desi sweet of all times period.\n4. The traffic is a nightmare, but its similar to Gurgaon, if not worse. Also brings it to a standstill after heavy rains. More of an Indian metro issue than just Hyd.\n5. Never faced any water issues in the whole North India, here, specially the new city area (Hitech city) was a barren land, so come peak summers, very significant water problem. Have to completely rely on water tankers, which adds up to rent costs.\n6. Gated society flat rent and buy rates are eye watering, much high than Delhi NSR. But there is also a positive mentioned in pros below.\n7. Ola and Uber demand far exceeds the supply. And forget Uber or Ola money. NEVER put balance in it, instead keep upi handy. Every damn auto or bike guy has a qr code ready with them. Or keep cash, but upi is of course more convenient. You have to have at least a 2-wheeler for your convenience, peak hours mein its a pain to get an auto or even a bike, public transport is very bad, old rickety lopsided buses.\n8. Flouting traffic rules is the past time of Hyderabad, go to old Hyderabad and you will see more people without helmets than with. I used to be pissed off at every wrong side, no helmet rider, but have learned to be more careful and patient myself and accept this lawlessness lol.\n\nPros - \n1. The weather is hot till May, then it starts raining cats and dogs from June so no heat till next year March. Can't imagine a single night without AC in June or July in the north.\n2. A heaven for foodies, the non veg kind specially. The biryani, the curries and the Andhra cuisine is excellent!\n3. Tha cafe and restaurant options are unlimited and varied. The cafe culture is excellent, you can go to a local cafe and enjoy talking with your friends for hours, imagine a more accessible and unpretentious Starbucks experience in almost any residential locality. \n4. Local bakeries are very nice, have a good sale so the produce is fresh. I have stopped ordering bread from Blinkit.\n5. The dhinchak dakhini hindi dialect is commonly used, and the assholery like Bangalore is not here. Yes, forcing others to learn a language (unless they themselves feel the need due to issues in communicating) by abusing Northerners in an auto cab or anywhere outside is plain assholery in my book. So you can easily live here if you know Hindi.\n6. You can wear whatever the fuck you want, 365 days a year. I have seen fully burka clad and short skirt wearing ladees in my office. And have purposefully tried to see if any men are leering at the skirt wali grills, honestly out of 10, only 1 or 2 stare, which is saying a lot, compared to the way majority would r@pe with eyes in Delhi NCR. \n7. You can eat whatever, whenever the fuck you want, no closing of meat selling businesses for whole weeks or months. People (Hindus and Muslims both) will come on street if there is any ban on buying or selling any kind of food. We love our food and the freedom to eat it.\n8. Politically, they hate BJP and Congress equally. Hate Congress, because majority Hyderabadis being BRS fanbois and Congress won from the semi urban and rural Telangana. And have heard big electricity cuts in several places in Hyd since they came to power. BJP because they see what's happening in the north and dont want it to happen in Hyderabad.\n9. Very safe city, girls can roam around in late evening without fear of eve teasing or worse.\n10. It is also a pretty clean city, not in the leagues of Indore, Chandigarh etc. but much cleaner than the whole Delhi NCR.\n11. I said gated society rent and buy rates are eye watering, but people majorly live in standalone building with ease. This is because of bare minimum crime rates. One can live with family in a standalone building with peace of mind. Cant even think of the same in Gurgaon.\n\nAll in all, this is honestly the country's best metro right now. I plan to settle completely, have my kids assimilate into the culture, learn telugu (my kids and I), and become native Hydra Baddies ASAP.","12":"Took me by surprise! Ordered from Blinkit for instant delivery as a filler till my beans arrive.\n\nInitial impressions with paper filter FP was not great some chocolaty notes but finishing with oaky bitterness.\n\nTried with V60 and man it surprised me with the taste. Cant believe this supermarket coffee with packing date going back 5 plus months can tatste this good with nice brown sugar, chocolate, mild spice notes almost at par with BTs of the world. Idk what's lavazza doing here, I generally don't have high hopes from them but went for it thinking at least it is 100% arabica unlike gusto crema \/ classico. \n\nDefinitely not recommended from freshness perpective but tin can packaging made me give it a shot. \n\nFeel free to drop in your experience if youve tried this before.","13":"Is HSBC Live+ not offering 10% Cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions? Hey Fellow Credit Card Enthusiasts,\n\nI recently picked up the HSBC Live+ Credit Card, which comes with one of the highest fees I\u2019ve paid so far\u2014\u20b9999 + GST.\n\nA significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries, especially for items like milk, fruits, and veggies. I usually shop on Flipkart, Bigbasket via Tataneu, Jiomart, and Amazon Fresh, with the occasional order from Swiggy Instamart. I\u2019ll also use Dmart Ready, Blinkit or Zepto if there\u2019s a great discount.\n\nI had been using the following cards earlier:\n- Flipkart Axis (LTF) for 5% on Flipkart Grocery\n- BB gift cards bought at 10-25% discount on BB Tataneu for smaller transactions or Tataneu Infinity(LTF) for 10% instant discount + 10% Neucoins\n- Axis Ace(Chargeable) on Jiomart for 1.5% Cashback \n- HDFC Millennia(LTF) \/Amazon Pay ICICI (LTF) for Amazon Fresh\n- HDFC Swiggy(LTF) for 10% cashback for Swiggy Instamart\n- Axis Ace (Chargeable) for 1.5% for Dmart Ready\n\nAfter making a few transactions, I reached out to HSBC customer care to confirm cashback eligibility. They informed me that my Jiomart purchases qualify for the 10% cashback, which is great. However, my Flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 1.5% reward rate, despite spending specifically on Flipkart Grocery. I even double-checked the merchant name on my Flipkart Axis and Axis Ace statement\u2014it clearly shows Flipkart Grocery for the grocery transactions but for HSBC, the merchant name is Flipkart.\n\nThis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on Flipkart, as their prices often match, if not beat, Dmart. If I can\u2019t get the 10% cashback on Flipkart Grocery transactions, I may have to rely on my Flipkart Axis card for the 5% cashback, or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value (which might not always be feasible for my purchases)\n\nDoes anyone else with the HSBC Live+ card have experience with Flipkart Grocery cashback? Any advice or solutions would be appreciated!\n\nAlso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money?","14":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing.

Recently, the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company Zomato announced an initiative, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, to limit food wastage because of canceled orders.\n\nRight after Zomato\u2019s cofounder Deepinder Goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media, a Bengaluru-based product manager, suggested potential improvements on Twitter for the feature to prevent misuse.\n\nThe man named Bhanu proposed that Zomato\u2019s Food Rescue option should exclude cash-on-delivery orders, and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500-metre radius of their location.\n\nHe opined that customers can misuse the discounts, where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices. Further, the Bengaluru man recommended that Zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer, capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature.\n\nThoroughly impressed, the Zomato boss responded directly to Bhanu\u2019s post, saying that these suggestions, among others, had already been incorporated into the feature. Goyal praised Bhanu\u2019s \u201cgood thinking,\u201d and inquired about Bhanu\u2019s background expressing the desire to work together in the future.\n\n\u201cWho are you and what do you do?\u201d the Zomato cofounder wrote. \u201cWould love to know you more, and see if we can work together.\u201d\n\nBhanu replied that he is a product manager based in Bengaluru, working for a startup. He also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media, particularly tagging Zomato\u2019s sister company, Blinkit. \n\nIncidentally, with Zomato\u2019s new feature, \u2018Food Rescue\u2019, canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order. To maintain the quality and freshness of the food, the option will remain open only for a short time. ","16":"Delivery apps analysis What are your thoughts on quality and cost: Amazon Fresh vs Blinkit vs Swiggy Instamart vs BigBasket vs Zepto?\n\nI was ordering groceries today and had some free time, so I did a quick comparison of these services. Wanted to get everyone\u2019s views and experiences\u2014how do you find the quality and cost across these apps? Any favorites or ones you avoid? Feel free to add others if I\u2019ve missed any good ones.\n\nMy analysis: cost perspective (best to worst)\n\n1. Amazon fresh\n2. Zepto\n3. Swiggy\n4. Blinkit\n5.

Sometimes Blinkit has these product listed out of stock, need a few backups preferably around Sardarpura, Ratanada, and Shastri Circle. ","18":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Dec 16th, 2024 Hi\u00a0[r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/\/)\u00a0\\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Facebook global advertising revenue is on track to surpass $100B in 2024 and a global audience of 2.2B users. This makes Facebook the most-populous and best-monetized social media platform in the world.\n___\n**Shopify** released its full Winter '25 Edition \u2014 dubbed \u201cThe Boring Edition\u201d \u2014 featuring 150+ updates designed to make merchants\u2019 businesses run smoother. I can't tell you how many times I've said something like, \u201cI wish Shopify would take a break from adding new features and fix the the issues with their existing tools.\u201d And now my dreams have come true! I hope that Shopify continues this \u201cboring edition\u201d tradition for years to come. As a developer and merchant, the updates contained in this recent edition are long-awaited and highly appreciated. Check out the comments on this post, where I'll share a list of highlights from the Boring Edition.\n___\n**Amazon** announced its entry into the automotive market with the launch of Amazon Autos, a platform that will initially offer Hyundai vehicles to US customers. Amazon Autos works as a middleman between buyers and car manufacturers, allowing vehicle shoppers in 48 US cities to browse, order, finance, and schedule pickup of a new Hyundai vehicle from their local participating dealer directly on Amazon. Amazon says that the platform offers dealerships \u201ca new sales channel that connects them with millions of Amazon customers.\u201d\n___\nIn February this year, **OpenAI** introduced **Sora**, its generative AI model that can create realistic videos from text prompts. Sora initially launched into private beta testing. Now the company has launched a new version of Sora called \u201cSora Turbo\u201d that it says is significantly faster than the model it previewed in February and released it as a standalone product at Sora.com to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 seconds long, and in widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. They can also bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend or create entirely new content from text.\n___\n**Shopify** made **Shop Campaigns** available to all of merchants in the US and Canada, an advertising tool that was previously only available to Shopify Plus merchants. Shopify describes them as \u201crisk-free campaigns across platforms and borders to drive customer growth with Shop.\u201d Merchants only pay for conversions, when new or existing customers convert, while Shopify takes care of optimizing the creative, audience, and ad placements without the merchant having to create new assets. To clarify one thing \u2014 Shop Campaigns aren't driving traffic to the merchant's store, but rather, to their products and storefront within the Shop App. However once the customer makes a purchase through Shop App, they become part of the merchant's customer database and e-mail \/ SMS list (if they opt-in).\u00a0\n___\n**Wix** introduced a new gen-AI tool called **\u201cAI Site-Chat\u201d** that is designed to serve as a virtual agent for customers. The tool enables businesses to answer customer inquiries and provide relevant information 24\/7, including when there are no customer service representatives available. AI Site-Chat works by integrating with the website's internal systems, allowing it to pull live data such as up-to-date product info and customer orders. Wix says that the main purposes of the chatbots are to boost customer experience by being available 24\/7, act as a sales assistant by delivering price and customized answers and recommendations to visitors, and capture leads by ensuring all customer inquiries are answered.\n___\n**WooCommerce** shared its vision for the future and key areas of focus for the upcoming year in a post entitled, *WooCommerce in 2025: Building a platform for the future*. Updates include a High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) system demonstrates 5x faster order processing and 1.5x faster checkouts, block-based checkout that gives merchants more control over their checkout experience (similar to Shopify's Checkout Blocks), Cost of Goods Sold, which allows merchants to calculate profit margins for products and orders, and Back in Stock Notifications. WooCommerce is bringing more commerce capabilities directly into the core product as part of its \"more in core\" shift, which is aimed at giving merchants a fully-integrated set of functionality out-of-the-box without having to rely on plugins and custom functionality solutions.\n___\n**In other Automattic \/ WordPress news this week\u2026** A group of WordPress contributors, including long-time core committers and community leaders, issued a call for changes to the governance of the open-source project, urging Matt Mullenweg to work with the community instead of continuing to act unilaterally. In an open letter entitled Dear WordPress community: We stand with you, the contributors raised objections about governance, transparency, and decision-making processes of the organization, highlighting concerns about \u201cdouble standards,\u201d including Mullenweg\u2019s lack of accountability under the project\u2019s Code of Conduct and the executive director\u2019s direct employment by Automattic.\n___\nThe open letter follows an order by a California District Court judge for **Automattic** to stop blocking **WP Engine's** access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.\n___\n**Amazon** is joining the likes of Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart in India with its new quick commerce offering that promises to deliver everyday essentials in 15 minutes or less. The pilot program will begin in Bengaluru later this month, rumored to launch under the name \u201cTez\u201d \u2014 which is a Hindi word that means \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cquick.\u201d Amazon already operates Amazon Fresh in the country, which offers a two-hour delivery service, and the 15-minute service could help the company attract more grocery and everyday essential customers.\n___\n**Meta** is supporting **Elon Musk's** effort to block **OpenAI's** conversion from a non-profit company into a for-profit one. The company sent a letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta claiming that the shift would have \u201cseismic implications for Silicon Valley,\u201d while also saying that Musk and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis are qualified to represent the interests of Californians in the matter. Meta wrote, \u201cIf OpenAI\u2019s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government.\u201d\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0manipulates its workplace injury data\u00a0and rejected recommendations to improve safety conditions for its workers, according to a Senate investigation led by Bernie Sanders. The\u00a0160-page report\u00a0digs into the company's \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and claims that Amazon manipulates workplace injury data to make its warehouses appear safer than they actually are by cherry-picking statistics. The committee found that Amazon recorded 30% more injuries in 2023 than the warehousing industry average, and that Amazon warehouse workers were almost twice as likely to be injured than workers in other warehouses during the last seven years. Amazon\u00a0said\u00a0it cooperated with the probe despite Sanders\u2019 \u201cpre-conceived narrative\u201d and that Sanders never responded to the company's invitation to visit one of its facilities.\n___\n**Canada Post**\u00a0operations are\u00a0set to resume\u00a0tomorrow, December 17th, following a CIRB ruling confirming that both parties are at an impasse. As a result, the CIRB ordered employees to return to work and postal operations to begin again, while extending the terms of the existing collective agreements between Canada Post and the workers union until May 22, 2025 and putting forward an offer to implement a wage increase of 5% for employees. Wow, just in time for no-one's holiday orders to be delivered in time! Value Added Resource has an\u00a0up-to-date timeline\u00a0of events that have transpired between the postal service and the workers union.\u00a0\n___\n**Donald Trump's transition team**\u00a0invited representatives\u00a0from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, and TikTok to a meeting to discuss how to deal with online sales of drugs. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing the issue.\n___\n**Google**\u00a0is\u00a0testing the ability\u00a0to track prices, share, and save products from within Google Search and Google Shopping. Clicking the \u201cTrack Price\u201d button enables push notifications and e-mails for price drops, while the \u201cShare\u201d button opens up social sharing links and the \u201cSave\u201d button adds it to your saved results.\n___\n**Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi and John Moolenaar**, who serve on the House Select Committee on the CCP, are\u00a0urging Google and Apple\u00a0to remove\u00a0**TikTok**\u00a0from their app stores ahead of the potential ban next month. Under US law, both companies must take the necessary steps to ensure they can fully comply with the requirement by January 19, 2025. The DOJ said that if the ban takes effect on Jan. 19, it would \u201cnot directly prohibit the continued use of TikTok\u201d by Apple or Google users who have already downloaded the app, but that the prohibitions on providing support \u201cwill eventually be to render the application unworkable.\u201d\n___\n**Total returns**\u00a0are\u00a0projected to reach $890B\u00a0in 2024, according to a report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns. Retailers estimate that 16.9% of their annual sales will be returned this year. More than two-thirds of retailers surveyed said that they are prioritizing upgrading their returns capabilities within the next six months.\n___\n**Big tech companies**\u00a0are getting in line to\u00a0kiss Trump's ring. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta, and Amazon have all pledged to make $1M personal or corporate donations to Trump's inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has an upcoming meeting scheduled with Trump, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that the company is \u201cturning the page\u201d in regards to their relationship with Trump.\u00a0\n___\n**China's market regulator**\u00a0has directed PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu, to fix its refund-only policy, which allows consumers to get back money for goods bought from merchants without returning the products. Wu Libin, senior partner at M&T Lawyers, said, \u201cThe policy has been used by platforms to leverage their dominant position to attract consumers at the expense of merchants, leading to unfair practices and market distortion. Regulatory intervention aims to balance interests between platforms and merchants, while ensuring fair competition.\u201d\n___\n**TikTok**\u00a0is\u00a0taking the Canadian government\u00a0to court. Last month the federal government ordered TikTok to wind down its operations in the country following a national security review. Now TikTok Canada has filed notice of application for judicial review, which is an official legal challenge to the decision. Regardless of the outcome, Canadian citizens will still have access to the app. The order simply requires TikTok to cease business operations in the country, which TikTok says will lead to an unnecessary loss of jobs.\n___\n**JD.com's founder Richard Liu**\u00a0has been\u00a0quietly running the e-commerce group\u00a0from London for the past several years, despite having stepped down as chief in 2022, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Liu's direct reports regularly travel from China for meetings with the billionaire, who also spends time in Dubai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, to confer with him about company management and important decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion.\n___\n**Shopify app extensions**\u00a0including admin links, checkout extensibility, and theme app extensions\u00a0can no longer be used\u00a0to advertise apps, promote related apps, or request reviews, according to a recent change by the company, which Shopify offered no explanation on why. CEO of KnoCommerce Jeremiah Prummer explained via a\u00a0LinkedIn post\u00a0how removing the \u2018powered by' message from his company's free tier means losing their greatest organic growth lever.\u00a0\n___\n**Google**\u00a0and\u00a0**Samsung**\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a mixed-reality headset, challenging Apple and Meta in the space. The collaboration launched a new version of Google's Android software for XR, short for \u201cextended reality,\u201d alongside a Samsung-built headset code-named Project Moohan, taken from the Korean word for \u201cinfinite.\u201d The new Android will allow companies to design their own XR devices, including headsets and glasses, while taking advantage of Google's latest AI advances. The hope is to replicate the success Google had with mobile Android across the VR \/ AR space.\n___\n**Also in the world of wearable tech..**. Solo\u00a0launched\u00a0its AirGo Vision smart glasses, featuring visual recognition powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. The AirGo Vision glasses start at $299, the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, and can identify and answer questions about people, objects, and text seen by the camera, as well as translate text into different languages, provide directions, and give the user information about what they're looking at.\n___\nA growing number of\u00a0**Chinese e-commerce merchants**\u00a0are\u00a0selling their products\u00a0on Russian online marketplaces as exporters increasingly look to find new markets and avoid western tariffs. Several Chinese suppliers told FT that they were registering local Russian e-commerce stores, which requires opening a Russian bank account, paying for in-country warehouses, and receiving payment in roubles.\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0has\u00a0begun to remove\u00a0merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and mugs that bear the words \u201cdeny, defend, depose,\u201d which were terms written on bullet casings found at the site of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The company said that the products violated their guidelines, but didn't mention exactly which guidelines those were. Free Luigi merchandise has been popping up all over e-commerce platforms including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and GoodShirts.\u00a0\n___\n**Klarna**\u00a0was\u00a0hit with a $46M fine\u00a0by Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority for breaches in anti-money laundering regulations. The investigation, which spanned from April 2021 to March 2022, revealed shortcomings in Klarna's risk assessment and customer due diligence processes, determining that they failed to adequately evaluate the potential use of products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing. Sebastian Siemiatkowski is probably like, \u201cWe have AI that'll fix that now!\u201d\n___\n**Amazon Teamsters**\u00a0authorized strikes\u00a0at two facilities in New York following Amazon's refusal to recognize their union and negotiate a contract addressing the company's low wages an dangerous working conditions, according to the union. The strikes come after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters called on Amazon to agree to bargaining dates for a union contract by Dec 15th.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**, which first launched in September 2023, is\u00a0outperforming\u00a0**Shein**\u00a0and\u00a0**Sephora**\u00a0among US shoppers when it comes to consumer spending.

So somewhere needed there.  \n  \nSummary: Pre IPO investing is generally a difficult call. It's got a 50:50 chance. I am sure there are good investing options available in the listed markets.  \n  \nIf you found this post useful, share it with your friend.","22":"Fruits in campus Guys which is the best place to buy fresh fruits, almart, amazon fresh, blinkit,or anything else?","23":"Any retail stores stocking Fisherman\u2019s Friend mints? \nHas anyone come across the Fisherman\u2019s Friend mint lozenges singles or multipacks in retail stores in the city?

So I had to get a few boxes of Cadbury celebrations for my office for an event, only condition was I had to get the gst bill so that I can reimburse it later. So I thought I'll go to Dmart and get the boxes. So I went in the evening but I could only find two boxes there, both were opened and empty. Then I went to Ondoor store, they didn't have any. Then I went to Bazaar on dwaar, again no luck. Then I went to a bakery, they had it stock but couldn't provide a bill with gst number so I had to come empty handed. Then I went to Vishal mega Mart but they also didn't have any boxes.\n\nSo I came back home and thought I'll get the boxes delivered online via Instamart or blinkit but both apps were showing out of stock for my home location and office location. So I thought ok, I'll get the chocolates from another dmart tomorrow while going to office.\n\nBut when I went there at around 8:30 am, they said they'll open at 10 am. The dmart near my house opens at 8 am but this one open a bit late. Again no luck. So I thought I'll reach office and searched for another supermarket near my office. There was one reliance fresh which was a bit further from office but I thought what the heck. So I went there, there was one box but I needed more. So I came out empty handed and then went to another Vishal mega Mart in opposite direction. Again no luck, I didn't enter, from the outside only they showed me one small fridge with a few chocolates. Then I went further down the road to a sweet shop to try my luck but they only had sweet boxes. Finally I went to Reliance Smart. They were separating bad bananas from good ones. I asked and my prayer was finally answered. I took the boxes and finally went to office and decided to never volunteer for any event in future. Had poha jalebi on the way to office and finally reached office. But only 6 people joined the event out of 26, that too they kept going in and out of conference room.

I have always had terrible experience with Amazon Fresh and hence never used to order from Amazon Fresh. Lately, I have learnt that the so called \"rush delivery\" whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by Amazon Fresh.\n\nTwice I opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs. Today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and I contacted Amazon, I later learnt that all these so called \"rush deliveries\" are handled by Amazon Fresh. I then realized why they were getting delayed. Amazon Fresh has always been crap since Day 1. The worst part is they won't even let you cancel an Amazon Fresh order even if it has not been dispatched. \n\nSo if you are ordering something from Amazon, **never choose any of the time slots**, your order will be then handled by Amazon Fresh and you will be sorry you chose them.\n\nAs a side note, always check the item on Blinkit before ordering from Amazon. Their SKU has expanded significantly. The order which was delayed by Amazon Fresh, I checked it on Blinkit and got it in 5 minutes. Meanwhile the original Amazon order is now more than 36 hrs. old and there is no option to cancel it on Amazon. I really wonder how they (Amazon Fresh) are still alive as a division.","31":"Fresh strawberries in Jaipur?

My expenses were not high around that time and most small payments were still in cash (the ubiquitousness of PoS, UPI acceptance on ground is still only a recent trend thanks to Covid and Demonetization) and thus stayed put with it for quite some time and allow my earnings to grow (5+ years). Got Onecard, Sapphiro as LTF. Added DCB and Magnus to the portfolio. Got ICICI Amazon Pay for free Prime membership and benefits. Then caught LTF hysteria from this sub and added Au Bank Ixigio, Indusind Legend and IDFC First WOW to my portfolio. Got Kotak League hoping to use it for my UPI RuPay spend but ended up with a dysfunctional card (haven't been able to set my UPI pin still due to their backend issues, will patiently wait as it is LTF and only as backup for Tata Neu Plus now, although direct UPI from account is always the ultimate backup). Filled that UPI RuPay void with HDFC Tata Neu Plus (My first non-LTF card but FYF still, I know infinity is better but I am more comfortable with annual fee waiver condition of plus than infinity)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Card Bill Payments:\n\nI am still experimenting here for now with my Debit Cards (Axis, Citi, SBI) to see which is providing the best net cash conversion. From App perspective, payments made via Paytm have been swift so far though it allows only SBI DC since Axis and Citi are both Mastercard. Payzapp allows all my DCs but it takes at least 3 working days for confirmations to come back from the issuer banks whenever I have tried this route. I am thinking of trying out Axis or HDFC native portals for paying credit card bills across banks via DC this month. Till I find a better option, in terms of privacy, payment instrument acceptance and reliability, I will stick to Paytm + SBI DC as my default combo. Rewards from the facilitator app is not my main criteria, I will settle once I have optimized my DC rewards. (I have never used Cred, Cheq and plan to maintain that stance owing to many others in the sub posting about their privacy issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLifestyle Expenses:\n\nAlmost two domestic flights every month. Homestay bookings. Prefer to eat home cook food and just fruits as a meal at least once in a day. As much as possible, I prefer to avoid quick commerce - Blinkit, Zepto, BB and food deliveries - Swiggy, Zomato and instead go for morning\/afternoon walks in the park and buy veggies\/fruits along my back and whenever I am out at homestays, prefer to walk down (at least one side) to nearby restaurants and have my food served to me fresh. This alone results in substantial savings (no overpriced buying\/convenience\/delivery fees), enforces me to remain in shape (no need to pay for gym memberships) and lesser medical bills due to healthy lifestyle (no need to take in Vitamin D health supplements either by being exposed to plenty of sunlight during my strolls) - much more than any credit card rewards program can offer. Occoasional fine dining with family, 2-4 times a month - gift cards, weekend dining acceleration, payment offers on eazydiner, zomato, dineout usually come in handy. Shopping on apparels - once or twice a year. Major family trips - only dometic till now (probably once a year along with 2-3 minor ones to driveable distances). May target for a family international trip this Calendar year - only if I achieve my investment milestone that I am working upon. Term, health insurance. Movie Theatres - barely 4 in an year - only real good ones otherwise remain patient and enjoy it over OTT. Other things include - utility, fuel, auto\/cab. Big ticket purchases - occasional over some years (not a fan of splurging unnecessarliy on electronics, gadgets, appliances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit Rating:\n\nI have decent credit limit on many cards and my combined (across all cards) monthly credit limit is pretty close to my annual net in-hand salary despite still not having an outstanding CIBIL score (725+).  I configure my spend limits to be substantially lower than my credit limits on each of the app to ensure that I don't over-spend and my lost card liability is reduced (to an extent, if, god forbid, that ever happens). I don't have any missed payment history, avoided BNPLs, no EMI purchases (even when there is a lucrative offer). Avoided taking loans on big ticket purchases (of liabilities) such as a car and waited to accumulate necessary funds and\/or settled for a variant that fulfill all my needs (but not all of my wants).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpilogue:\n\nI still have mostly LTF cards. I remember an Amex sales rep reaching out to me during my recent 080 Bangalore Airport Lounge visit, about to start his well-rehearsed sales pitch, before which I interjected - you won't have my attention unless you say \"It's LTF\". For now I have stayed put with that strategy (with Tata Neu Plus being the only exception) owing to the fact that my \"core cards\" are already LTF. Even if my core cards get devalued, I won't have to re-assess my spending strategy immediately to be able to get back my joining\/annual\/inactivity fees or worry about points redemption and allow myself time to scout for replacements. I have also stayed away from credit card offerings from PSUs - reason being their digital journey is still at a nascent stage and many of them still want applications to be manually submitted to the nearest branch. SBI card is an exception in terms of digitialization, but it doesn't fulfill the LTF criteria and I don't see a real need for their cashback cards in my portfolio (I am fine to be sub-optimal here and take a 0.5-1.5% hit on some short ticket expenses and save myself from the cognitive load which I will happily redirect elsewhere).\n\nNeedless to say, I am pretty thankful of both - this sub and technofino community which serves as a repository of wisdom, reviews, updates, news, hacks and what not for the current and future Indian credit card holders. I hope the community continues to blossom and I am always open to hear thoughts from other members to help me improvise my strategy basis solid arguments.","34":"Toxic work culture ft.

These deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products, subscribing to unnecessary services, or revealing personal data.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy to protect yourself:\n\nUse a Low-Range Smartphone: Buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns.\n\nGet a New SIM Card: Register those apps with a new SIM to keep your primary contact and data safe.\n\n\nTest Before You Commit: Use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device.\n\n\nWhy this works: Some apps use tactics like price discrimination, tracking, or pushing inflated prices based on your phone's model or usage patterns. By using a budget device, you might avoid being flagged as a high-value target.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: This is especially helpful for users in the age range of Gen Z, as they're frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns.

Dairy milk chocolate (which I melted and put few drops over the cube) \n2. Honey\n3. Red chillies and salt\n4. Lime \n\nAnd put them into freezer \n\nAfter few hours I tried them the one with dairy milk was awesome, I liked honey one too, \n\nChilies were too much and lime was there or not i have no clue because Kiwi was sour, maybe off season or something\n\nOverall noted few things \n\n1. You can't eat frozen fruit directly it just like an ice cream difference is you lick ice cream most of the time or its creamy but fruit is like an ice cube it was hard, have to give some time to eat after putting them. Out of freezer\n\n2. So I got some 20+ pieces overall because I wanted to get taste test done from my family members and as we were eating and discussing they started to melt (again weather problem India is too hot and humid) \n\n3. Add on Flavours started to melt away as well\n\n4. Although fruit was able to maintain there texture and taste plus point so it does increase shelf life if done properly\n\n5. Cutting a fruit properly to maintain equal size is difficult and time consuming and as well it creates wastage \n\n6. Dragon fruit is a F tasteless fruit (not the first time eating it I am having it since childhood) and Kiwi is moslty sour \n\nIt doesn't mean I am giving up on the idea, i will do some more R&D and with basic fruit as well Kiwi and dragon fruit is kinda expensive as well not widely available or likeable fruit in India \n\nI ordered frozen strawberry too it was available on blinkit and it was tasteless, I love strawberries, I eat them a lot, but it was hard to consume, it was more suitable for smoothie or as toppings, that's why most brand do only berries as frozen fruit \n\nI will try again with the sample in few weeks, with full research this time and preparation and hopefully come up with crazy combos and ways to make it more flavourful and easy to bite \n\nIf you have any suggestions or ideas or a roast or anything would love to hear them out \n\nThank you for the time ","62":"Do you use an egg boiler?

However, later, another agent told me to deal with ON directly\n\nON customer care agent told that they have **updated their authentication process**, and products with QR stickers are also genuine now. (Yes. it is mentioned in the 6th slide on their official website)\n\nNow, I\u2019m completely confused\u2014has anyone else experienced this?

Can I buy protein from blinkit? \nThe seller is officially mentioned authorised online sellers","91":"Zomato delivery guy took my 2k money  Idk how to start this but i orderd a package from blinkit which they give me an expired one. So i tried to return it but i missed the delivery guy call in which they made my order not returnable. Then i again order something and i told the delivery partner that i wont give u full money insted u can take this expire product and take the rest of money but he refused. when i said let me talk to your manager. he also refused to give me number, since there was language barrier between us, my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening. In the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it. So after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders. My friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them. So after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there. It was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language. They even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me. After we talked to manager. The manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry. The another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it. I said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue. then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian. So they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them.\n\nThen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry. Then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen. They asked my id card bc they thought i wqs like but since i didnt had it they told why did i lied but i said am a jobless. They asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money. Somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused. Then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it. I am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead. They even hit us and tried to fight with us. I just wanted to share this bc the thing havent gone this far if the zomato had improved there customer support.","92":"Different angle on looking at Zepto\/Blinkit Model So, i do see many posts here focusing on blinkit zepto and majority of them focus on \"Quick service\" or \"10 minutes aspect\"\n\nBut one thing that these 2 platform does is that....it has strongly pushed indian d to c brands and helped them reach out to customers.....from products like phool, ,kapiva, wellbeing nutrition, perfora, the whole truth, raw etc....all this products you get from amazon or flipkart takes 3 4 days, if u buy from the website takes even more, these platforms have just made it available instantly\n\nso its not just about groceries and vegetables, but with so many products especially from new age startups makes them very strong , and also its even better for these brands as they find good amount of customers. It empowers many new product based startups , which may not really find place in offline market or nearby stores.","93":"Trust worthy platform for electronic  Hey, myself sage but I'm bit confused over something, shall I use blinkit or Amazon for purchasing my mouse, Idk im confused over blinkit as would they allow return if it's damaged or any particular reasons lemme know your suggestions.","94":"E-commerce Industry News Recap \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi\u00a0r\/ecommerce\u00a0- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage. Ely Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told Reuters, \u201cWe really focus on fine-grain control, teaching the model the concepts that video editors and videographers use \u2013 things like camera position, camera angle, camera motion.\u201d\n___\n**Walmart**\u00a0is\u00a0offering\u00a0an extended holiday returns policy for any items purchased from Oct 1 to Dec 31, 2024 \u2014 excluding wireless phones, protection plans, AppleCare, precious metals, and luxury items. (What's considered a \u2018luxury item' nowadays? Like an apple? Fruit's expensive now in the US.) All non-excluded items can be returned until January 31, 2025. Meanwhile Costco is like, \u201cHold my beer\u2026\u201d\n___\n**WhatsApp**\u00a0is\u00a0getting a new chat memory feature\u00a0that gives users a more tailored experience when searching on the app by remembering things like their interests, likes, and enjoyment, or if they are vegan. The feature is still in beta, but once it launches, users will have control over what the chatbot remembers, and they'll be able to remove and update data.\u00a0\n___\n**eBay**\u00a0introduced\u00a0a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d label in Germany, allowing commercial sellers to stand out on the platform by highlighting certain aspects of their service, such as timely shipping and above average customer service. Sellers do not need to sign up to be eligible to receive the label, which does not have a cost. Alongside the change, eBay Germany is dropping its \u201ceBay Guarantee\u201d and \u201ceBay Plus\u201d logos.\n___\n**Bestbuy Baby**, which has nothing to do with Best Buy the electronics retailer and is actually a baby retailer that had been part of the Bed Bath & Beyond group, is\u00a0closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores\u00a0to relaunch as a strictly online platform. The retailer previously closed and liquidated 115 locations last year when its parent company went bankrupt, but then months later announced a new strategy and the opening of 11 new stores, which will soon be shuttered.\n___\n**TikTok Shop**\u00a0is\u00a0introducing the sale\u00a0of refurbished electronics from select sellers on its platform, all which are required to meet specific performance standards. For example, sellers must provide reports from an approved 3rd party like PhoneCheck, Blancco, or BlackBelt, who inspect and rate the quality of the refurbished products. Currently only \u201cpremium\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d items can be sold.\n___\nPlus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Klarna** selling most of its portfolio of short-term, interest-free loans to Elliott Advisors, a London-based hedge fund, for \u00a330B.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.","95":"India: Got this deal on Blinkit. Wanted to get a second controller, this price is too good to pass on. Shall I get it. Do I have to worry about the version or quality? Blinkit hasn't let me down before.\n\n","96":"Please rate my High level design for Instamart\/Zepto\/Blinkit Hi Guys, I'm practicing for System Design Interviews and created a HLD for Instamart\/Blinkit. Please review it and suggest some points. I'm open for a feedback. Thanks.\n\nFollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n[https:\/\/excalidraw.com\/#json=Unf0TAY9pQ6y5Qjv2HiNF,qqVqRP37oSfrZGmIQSdgKw](https:\/\/excalidraw.com\/#json=Unf0TAY9pQ6y5Qjv2HiNF,qqVqRP37oSfrZGmIQSdgKw)\n\n# \n\nThe user first makes a request for products. A request is made to the Product Availability Service. The Product availability Service takes the Location of user as parameter. Using the user location the Product Availability Service then calls the nearby Delivery Centre Service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user. This Nearby DC Service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of Delivery Centre to a location Segment.  \nI opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant. And also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible.\n\nUsing user location the Nearby DC Service makes a call to the 3rd Party Mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment.  \nOnce the nearby DC Service has the list of nearby segments, it then gets the Delivery Centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to Product availability Service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products.  \nAll these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order.  \nOnce the user places the order, the order is placed via Request Order Service. The request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the DB. The order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count.\n\nThe Request Order Service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the Delivery Centre \/ Warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected. The Delivery Partner then Queries Delivery Partner Location Service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the Delivery Centre\/ Warehouse. This flow is similar to how we find Delivery Centres nearby a user.\n\nOnce the order is delivered by the Delivery Partner, the order delivery status is sent via Delivery Partner Location Service to Kafka. There is a Order Delivery Status Consumer that fetches the delivery status, sends it to Order service which then updates the status or order.  \nTalking about the location of delivery partner, the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to Delivery Partner Location Service. the DP Location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the DP location receives this information it then stores it in redis.\n\nAll of the components can be scaled horizontally.\n\n[Instamart System Design](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rmnf8e0qlsld1.png?width=13096&format=png&auto=webp&s=c26d6fb1a088e08ccb84450bc9dc6f367c0125ac)\n\n","97":"Created an app in which you can compare prices between multiple platforms like instamart, blinkit etc.  \n\nHi guys, I created an app [Shopswiftly](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.soartech.shopswiftly.shopswiftly) where you can compare prices of multiple products available on platforms like Instamart, Blinkit, Bigbasket Zepto.

","99":"Is assessing TAM overrated ?  Of course, TAM is the most crucial aspect to assess before you invest your money and time in a venture in the unknown, but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche, yet in the grand scheme of things, it can be a brilliant product\/service. Users probably don't know they needed it, but they do if it's executed correctly.\n\nI have been building a peer-to-peer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market, for pennies. For example, renting the Apple Vision Pro (a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since it's not a very refined product) for a day for just 30-40 USD.(Sorry for the dumbed down explanation) \n\nAnd I have been told that it's a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities, especially in the Indian market, because Indian users are very different from those in the USA or European countries. First, it's a trust deficit market; people here believe in ownership. Although the population might look very huge, if you look at the TAM based on monetary value, it's a very small chunk, less than 0.5% of the population, but still a huge number and growing every day.\n\nAnd finally, my assessment is, if there is no way to avail this service, how would users know that it can be done? Quick commerce (10-minute grocery delivery) seemed to be a very absurd idea in the Indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store (grocery store) owners, and in every street, you can find multiple stores. Yet, it's a billion-dollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift. People are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas (operations limited to a few cities with high target population), and availing credit has become easier than anything. So one thing leads to another, and it's shaping an industry that still looks very absurd  . However, one of the many companies in the market, Blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion USD and threatening the business of giants like Amazon and Flipkart. \n\nI'm a first-time founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when I needed a camera for a project and couldn't find the one I wanted. So, I came up with this idea, but it took five years to finally execute it. We now have a few users on version 1.0 of our MVP. The biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trust-deficit market, and sometimes it feels like I'm working on a vetting company more than a P2P rental marketplace. We have learned so much in building it so far that I believe if this doesn't work, the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity.\n\nPlease share your thoughts or concerns. \n\nThank you for reading ","100":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of Oct 21st, 2024 Hi r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/ - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 75% of viral songs on TikTok started with a paid creator marketing campaign, according to one major label marketer's estimates. However there's currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo. Captioning a video with #ad or similar disclosure is required by the FTC when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post, but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song. Some larger creators fetch over $10,000 to use a song in one of their videos, while smaller creators can receive as little as $25 depending on their follower count.\n___\nThe **FTC** adopted a **\u2018click to cancel'** rule last week, which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it, and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships. Additionally, businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website, and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online. \n___\n**Google** is giving its **Shopping platform** a major overhaul with the help of AI. The company added features like: 1) AI generated shopping assistance, which aim to simplify search with friendly guidance that provide advice and recommendations on what to purchase. 2) Personalized shopping feeds that are comparable to TikTok's \"For You\" feed and showcases recently viewed products at the top, making it easy to resume shopping. 3) New deal finding tools such as price comparisons, price insights, and price tracking, as well as  new dedicated and personalized deals page. \n___\n**OpenStore** introduced **OpenDesk**, an AI-powered customer support tool that helps brand respond faster to customers and gain insights on their interactions. The tool enables brands to combine all their customer messages into one central dashboard, with messages automatically organized by topic so that teams can prioritize time-sensitive threads and their most valuable customers. OpenDesk can also auto-draft responses that can be personalized with relevant customer data such as order history, which appear next to the messages pane. Its analytics tools introduce a customer experience metric called \u201ctickets per order\u201d to more accurately evaluate and size the potential impact of customer pain points or opportunities to improve your business. OpenStore built OpenDesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40+ e-commerce brands it operates, and now it's opening the tool up to other companies.\n___\n**Permira** completed its $7.2B acquisition of **Squarespace**, officially taking the company private again. With the completion of the deal, Squarespace is no longer listed on the NYSE. As part of the transaction, Squarespace founder and CEO Anthony Casalena rolled over a majority of his existing equity and continues to be one of the largest shareholders in the company. He will also continue to serve as the company's CEO and Board Chairman.\n___\n**Mercari** and **Poshmark** are reconsidering their recent shift to buyer fees, away from seller fees. Mercari is currently testing adding buyer fees back into the item price, and Poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure. \n___\n**Etsy** sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward, **Shippo** and **Shipstation** will be the only third-party shipping services to be offered on the website. This means that other providers like Pirate Ship, Easyship, and ShippingEasy will no longer be offered as an integration. There's since been much confusion around what this notice actually means. Pirate Ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an e-mail and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using Pirate Ship. They later said they are confident that they will, but it's all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and Etsy. \n___\n1WorldSync released its fourth annual **Consumer Product Content Benchmark Report**, featuring insights collected from 1,750 shoppers across the US and Canada. A few highlights from the report include: 15% indicated that they are shopping on D2C sites more than in 2023, compared to 21% who are using D2C sites less (which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces). 49% of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews. 31% of shoppers now use ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other AI assistants to help inform their choices, up from 22% last year. However consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking. Just 35% said they found AI tools to be accurate often or always.\n___\n**The UK government** is set to introduce **regulations on BNPL** products, aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices. A consultation on the draft legislation began on Oct 17th and will remain open until Nov 29th, with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback. The proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks, clear disclosures, and protections under the Consumer Duty, aligning BNPL with existing credit card rules, much like what the US recently did. The government would offer a transition period for BNPL companies to catch up to speed, to avoid disruptions in the market.\n___\n**Meanwhile in the USA\u2026** The Financial Technology Association filed a lawsuit challenging the CFPB's new rule on BNPL products, saying that the rule \u201coversteps legal bounds.\u201d In May, the CFPB ruled that BNPL vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards, such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said, \u201cUnfortunately, the CFPB\u2019s rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts, oversteps legal bounds, and risks creating confusion for consumers. The CFPB is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of pay-in-four BNPL products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures, in excess of its statutory authority, and in an unreasonable manner.\u201d\n___\n**Former Amazon employee**\u00a0Stephanie Ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit Amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company, which she previously worked at for six years. The tell-all article highlights her interview and new hire experiences at Amazon for the second time, as well as shares how the company has changed under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. Ramo' post received thousands of likes and engagements, with dozens of current and former Amazon employees sharing their similar frustrations about the company in the comments.\u00a0\n___\n**Bonanza**\u00a0is\u00a0removing\u00a0the $2\u00a0tax\u00a0fee that it implemented last year for sellers who choose not to use its platform to print shipping labels. Now they want a cookie for their generous move. LOL. The company wrote, \u201cWe understand that every dollar counts. To help lower your expenses and streamline your operations, we are removing the $2 shipping assessment fee starting in November. This last assessment you will receive is November 1st so this means more savings for you and a simpler, more cost-effective process.\u201d Does it count as \u201chelping to lower expenses\u201d if you're the one that added the fee in the first place?\n___\n**Indian online retailers and marketplaces**\u00a0sold over $6.5B\u00a0worth of goods in one week of festive sales, marking a 26% increase YoY. Mobile phones, electronics, consumer durables, home and general merchandise accounted for 3\/4 of the total sales.\n___\n**British authorities**\u00a0are\u00a0investigating TikTok\u00a0for potential money laundering and terrorism financing taking place on its platform via its TikTok Coins, which can be converted back into real money. The regulatory concerns are similar to those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges\n___\n**X**\u00a0alerted users\u00a0that effective Nov 15th, their data can be used to train AI models for third party collaborators, which would extend the data's availability behind the company's own Grok AI model and let X license it to outside companies (like Reddit does with Google). The policy update indicates that users have the ability to opt-out, but it doesn't make it clear how to do so at this time. X is\u00a0also planning\u00a0on changing how its block feature works. The change would allow blocked people to see your public posts (instead of seeing nothing like now) \u2014 they just won't be able to like, repost, or reply. News of these changes resulted in a surge of\u00a01M new users\u00a0signing up for Bluesky in a 48-hour period.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest in three nuclear energy projects that will use a new type of miniature reactor to generator power. AWS Chief Executive Matt Garman said, \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\u201d\n___\n**Klarna's BNPL payment options**\u00a0are\u00a0now available\u00a0to\u00a0**Apple Pay**\u00a0users in the US and UK with options including pay in three or four installments and financing for higher-ticket items. The offering will be expanded globally, with Canada set to be added next in the coming months.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0is\u00a0piloting\u00a0a new small-format grocery concept in Chicago called Amazon Grocery that's meant for quick fill-in grocery runs with items like coffee, fruit, and grab-and-go meals. The pilot store is located within the same building as its Whole Foods store, with the goal of removing the need for Whole Foods customers to have to shop elsewhere. Just sell soda in Whole Foods and get it over with already!\n___\n**Apple**\u00a0is\u00a0now allowing businesses\u00a0to display their logos in phone calls, e-mails, map listings, and Apple Pay transactions. Apple's Business Connect launched in January 2023 and previously let users confirm their details, add photos, offer promotions, and receive orders, but now the new capabilities help businesses personalize their everyday phone call and email experiences.\n___\n**Blinkit**, an India-based delivery company that promises to deliver groceries and household goods in 10 minutes,\u00a0introduced\u00a0a 10 minute return and exchange service for clothing and footwear in select cities The move aims to address common online shopping concerns, such as size and fit issues, by making it relatively instant to swap out your purchases. At that point, the delivery driver might as well wait at your door while you try on the shoes!\n___\n**Taboola**\u00a0is\u00a0unveiling\u00a0a new AI-powered chat assistant called Abby to help make it easier for advertisers to create and run campaigns. Businesses will be able to enter conversational prompts like, \u201cI own a flower shop and want more people to come to my website to buy flowers,\u201d and from there the chatbot will spin up an ad campaign including both the text and images.\n___\n**Alibaba**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new large language model called Macro MT that's focused specifically on translations, with the hope of aiding buyers and sellers with cross-border e-commerce and trade efforts. Macro MT will integrate into Alibaba International's platforms including AliExpress, Lazada, and Trendyol, and will support 15 languages at launch, with more on the way.\n___\n**The Korean government**\u00a0published plans\u00a0to require e-commerce marketplaces to pay sales proceeds to sellers within 20 days of when a customer makes a purchase (which is still fairly long in my opinion, but better than nothing). The plan also requires the marketplaces to deposit at least half of the sales proceeds in financial institutions to ensure that sellers can recover at least some of their money if the platform goes bankrupt. The changes are in response to the\u00a0recent drama\u00a0with WeMakePrice and Tmon.\u00a0\n___\n**Amazon**\u00a0reprised\u00a0its \u201choliday beauty haul\u201d for a fourth year \u2014 which is its annual two week event where it runs discounts between 10% and 50% off on thousands of gift sets and beauty products on brands like BareMinerals, Clinique, and Maybelline. This year the event will run from today, Oct 21st, through Nov 3rd, with new deals dropping at various times throughout the two weeks.\n___\n**Meta**\u00a0fired two dozen\u00a0Facebook employees at its Los Angeles HQ for \u201cabusing\u201d their $25 meal credits by buying every day goods instead of meals. How does Amazon know I don't eat hand cream? That's personal. Aside from those particular terminations, Meta also\u00a0laid off, repositioned, and relocated\u00a0other employees from various departments including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, which the company says is to align with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.\u00a0\n___\n**Google's most senior executive**\u00a0overseeing search and advertising, Prabhakar Raghavan, is\u00a0leaving the position\u00a0to become chief technologist after four years leading the company's core business. CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo, \u201cHe\u2019ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\u201d Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan in the role.\n___\n**Airbnb**\u00a0launched\u00a0a new Co-Host Network that allows hosts to find top-rated co-hosts to help manage their properties. Currently only hosts with at least a 4.8 rating and a minimum of 10 hosted stays are invited to join the network, which is active in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US. Really brilliant idea! Airbnb owners are often looking for management for their properties, and no better place to find it than on the platform itself.\u00a0\n___\n**X**\u00a0dropped\u00a0**Unilever**\u00a0from an antitrust lawsuit accusing several companies and advertising groups of conspiring to boycott the platform, which it claims led to a decline in ad revenue. The two companies reached an agreement, with X committing to uphold Unilever's brand safety standards on the platform. Unilever brands include Dove soaps, Hellmann's condiments, and Pepsodent toothpaste. So is the plan to drop the lawsuit only against companies who agree to continue advertising on X? That seems like a weird \u201csettlement\u201d. Usually settlements don't inflate advertising metrics.\u00a0\u00a0\n___\n**Adobe**\u00a0started distributing\u00a0an AI model called Firefly Video Model that can generate video from text prompts and offers a special focus on making the AI footage blend in with conventional footage.

Batana aap log kya sochte ho - sab one time use and throw hai  Ever since the industrial revolution and mass production \u2013 We have increasingly been getting used to the idea of disposability. Single use plastic. Use and throw tissues. Indeed, any capitalist society thrives on how quickly obsolete things can become so that new \u201cthings\u201d can be bought to take their place. Now extend this idea to all facets of the human experience. Namely, the entire system of objects and our relationships we can categorise \u2013 from \u2018things\u2019, to \u2018social\/familial institutions\u2019 to \u2018ideas\u2019 to \u2018places\u2019 and of course, to ourselves.\nWe are living in an age of disposability. Situationships are disposable relationships. Selfies are disposable photographs (if you don\u2019t like one, take another!). People often claim that this is a \u2018generation of authenticity\u2019. I disagree. This is a generation of curated authenticity. Keep trying to be authentic, till you get it just right.\nThere is a DC supervillain called clay face- He can change his looks and demeanour at will. Far from being a gift, this is depicted as a curse. In having the ability to become temporarily everyone, he truly is permanently no one. A disposable identity, one might say.\nThere was a time when for better or worse, identity was defined by the circumstances of one\u2019s birth. A blacksmith\u2019s son would be a blacksmith, a tanner\u2019s child would be a tanner and a priest\u2019s child would be a priest. (I will not get into the intersectionality and issues of gender as a basis for identity, to keep this discuss on point)\nBut capitalism gave rise to the need for mobility. And geographical mobility also necessitated social mobility. Our identity was not defined by where we came from, but rather what we did. And what we did allowed us to buy brands. So as the traditional notions of identity fell away, we started identifying ourselves then by conspicuous consumption. Someone who could afford expensive stuff was richer and rich people were rich because, as capitalism assumed, they were more productive and therefore of more use to society.\nBut now conspicuous consumption is democratised. Access and accessibility, both have been solved for, In this era, we define ourselves not by conspicuous consumption, but by conspicuous production. And all we produce today is disposable. So our basis for identity today is \u2018conspicuous, disposable, production\u2019 \u2013 Content, Selfies, Latest trends, knowledge, streaming, selfies, 10 minute deliveries\u2026 .\nIt is no wonder then, that our lives are also increasingly getting verbified,\nWe fetishise action of any sort \u2013 We don\u2019t eat food, we are foodies. We don\u2019t watch moves, we binge watch. We don\u2019t buy, we blinkit. Brand names are also becoming verbs. Where once was Polo, now there is Munch, Where once was Horlicks now there is Boost.\nWe blinkit orders\nWe Swiggy Food\nUber is a great example of such conspicuous disposability. One time driver\u2026. No wonder then that most industries now are getting \u2018uberised\u2019.\nBut one shall watch this trend with great wariness.

Does it even allowed  Hyderabad-based Suhas Shetty narrated his predicament to Startup Pedia over a phone call. Here's the condensed version:\n\n\"My name is Suhas Shetty, and I'm the founder of Iceberg Organic Ice Creams, India's first and only organic ice cream brand. We've been around for 6 years and have 50+ franchise stores in South India. Recently, we ventured into North India with a dark kitchen model, allowing customers to order through Swiggy, Zomato, and our website.\n\nIn 2023, we participated in Shark Tank India Season 3 auditions\u2026we were thrilled to be selected for the final audition in Bangalore and filmed our pitch on September 23rd. The producers even suggested a \"Bahubali\" theme for our pitch to boost viewership, and we agreed.\n\nHere's where things went south.\n\nConfirmation for our episode airing arrived in January's 2nd week, just days before the season premiere.\n\nWe received confirmation that our episode would air on March 29th, the season finale. However, on the 28th, they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation.\n\nThis news was devastating. Based on the confirmation email, we had shipped nearly Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country, perishable products with a shelf life of just 3-4 months.\n\nSince then, I've relentlessly tried contacting the Shark Tank team. They didn't respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month. We've even secured a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Bahubali film producer Shobu Yarlagadda, addressing any theme-related concerns.\n\nMy requests are simple: Air the pitch or feature it in the \"unseen pitches\" segment on YouTube, as done in previous seasons. Out of 150 pitchers, I'm the only one fateful.\n\nFrustrated, we're desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto. But for a small brand, moving Rs 1.5 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge.\n\nWe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency. The same is expected from a platform like Shark Tank India. All I seek is a resolution \u2013 air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts.\"","129":"ARATA blinkit confusion.? Can anyone explain why deepi couldn't invest in Arata? ","130":"Swiggy scams - charging higher and other issues  Hey guys,\nThis is for general awareness. I\u2019ve been using both Zomato and Swiggy for a long time. \n\n1. Product charges are higher on Swiggy than on Zomato. Delivery fee is higher. Here\u2019s the kicker - I\u2019m a Swiggy one member. The same sandwich costs 250 on Zomato and 270 on Swiggy. Total ended up being higher by Rs. 60. This happens so much with every order that I don\u2019t even need to check with Swiggy app now. Swiggy overcharging is a Delhi thing. I spoke to a few friends in other city and they don\u2019t face this issue. \n\nYou\u2019re better off comparing with Swiggy and Zomato. \n\n2. Instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than Blinkit as well a lot of times. Not always. \n\n3. Instamart changes final bill\/order on the app. This has happened to me and my friends. We placed order for X. Received Y. Checked app and app showed that order was placed for Y (not X). After this happened a couple times, we started to take screenshots asap after placing order. It happened again but this time we had proof. Complained but nothing happened. This was 2-3 months back. \n\nPlease note that I haven\u2019t faced this problem in last 2-3 months.  That also maybe because I haven\u2019t used Instamart a lot in these months\n\nThat\u2019s all. Please take this as my opinion. Check for yourself when making purchases.  \n\nHope this helps in some way.  ","131":"Role of Packaging in overall UX of a product or service Hi, I recently used 'Blinkit' fast-delivery app (India), which has focused on the packaging a lot, and it works, it amplified that 'good' feeling once I received the product as expected. I am someone who considers functionality over aesthetics, and would rate an app 5 on 5 if the service\/product as they claim(in terms of quality or convenience), but blinkit experience was different than this opinion.\n\nI would appreciate if everyone can share their opinion on this, how do you think packaging is crucial in UX or is it just a compensation of poor product?\n\nThanks!","132":"Blinkit is the worst  Had a horrible experience with blinkit ,  rotten products, very bad and rude customer service people.

Each week I post a summary recap of the week's top stories, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in...  \n.\n\n1. **Walmart** surpassed $100B in online sales last year for the first time. Walmart is still not making money from e-commerce, but it's getting close. They've lowered e-commerce losses by more than 40% compared to last year\u2019s level and plans for online sales to become profitable with the help of its ancillary businesses like its advertising and fulfillment services to brands that sell on its marketplace. In the U.S., approximately 30% of Walmart\u2019s Marketplace sellers currently use Walmart Fulfillment Services.  \n.\n2. **Shein** launched its spring and summer collection yesterday via a livestream, working with celebrity influencers to attract attention to its shoppable livestream show \u201cShein Live: Front Row.\u201d This is the second time they've leveraged livestream to launch new collections. Last September, Shein showcased apparel from its fall-winter collection during a shoppable livestream event as well. Shoppers were able to view the three-hour livestream on YouTube, X, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as on Shein's app. Noticeably TikTok was not included on that list of channels, which could be because their livestream software doesn't yet integrate with TikTok, as I've recently learned that TikTok doesn't make it easy for 3rd party streaming platforms to connect.  \n.\n3. **Google** and **Reddit** negotiated a $60M content licensing deal to allow Reddit's data to be used to train their AI models, and they announced it in the weirdest way possible. Google wrote, \u201cReddit plays a unique role on the open internet as a large platform with an incredible breadth of authentic, human conversations and experiences, and we\u2019re excited to partner to make it even easier for people to benefit from that useful information.\u201d LOL \u2014 *human conversations*? Did Gemini write that announcement? As part of the deal, Reddit will integrate Google's Vertex AI to enhance its search capabilities on the platform, and Google now has access to Reddit's Data API, which delivers real-time content from their platform.  \n.\n4. **Amazon** is working on a new e-commerce marketplace to reach Indian shoppers called Bazaar, which it hopes will help the company further compete against Walmart-owned Flipkart, Reliance-owned Ajio, and SoftBank-backed Meesho. Bazaar will only feature unbranded fashion and lifestyle products that are priced below 600 Indian rupees ($7.20 USD), and Amazon will take no referral fee on sales. They will instead solely earn through their advertising and fulfillment services.  \n.\n5. **Wix** is tapping into Shopify's ecosystem for cross-border sales Okay, well technically Wix is partnering up with **Global-e** to help merchants sell internationally. However, Shopify acquired a 6.5% stake in Global-e back in 2021, which it increased to 10.20% in 2022, and most recently to 12.8% \u2014 so that makes it part of Shopify's ecosystem, right? Same as if Wix tapped into Flexport's fulfillment network or Klaviyo's e-mail and SMS services? The partnership will enable Wix merchants to price and sell in more than 100 countries, create customized local welcome messages and checkout flows, adhere to local tax and duty requirements, offer flexible pricing by country, and more.  \n.\n6. After retaking day-to-day control of **Square** last fall, Jack Dorsey is planning to overhaul the 15-year-old app so that it works more cleanly with Block's other products. His goal is to make Cash App one of the top providers of banking services to US households earning up to $150k annually by beefing up financial tools and making the P2P app the go-to banking source for Square sellers. A top priority this year will be tightening the integrations across Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, while eliminating up to five versions of the Square app that previously targeted different user groups and instead creating a single app called Square, with tabs for users to access various services.  \n.\n7. **Spotify** is following in the footsteps of Meta, Snap, YouTube, and TikTok by launching a new program to connect creators with brands. AUX, its new in-house \u201cmusic advisory agency\u201d for brands, will facilitate connections between brands and emerging artists for campaigns benefiting both parties. Coca-Cola is AUX's first client, which will team up with Peggy Gou, a South Korean DJ and songwriter, for a long-term partnership that will include live concerts, events, social media content, a branded playlist, and on-platform promotional support.  \n.\n8. **ShipBob** is now offering Amazon Shipping as a new delivery option for eligible US orders, according to its Winter '24 Release. It will now appear as a shipping option next to FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, and ShipBob's other fulfillment partners. Amazon Shipping is the company's shipping service for external deliveries that competes directly with FedEx and UPS. The service launched in 2018, but was paused in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic because Amazon was flooded with its own orders that it could barely keep up with during lockdown. However in August 2023, Amazon relaunched Amazon Shipping in the U.S. for both packages sold on Amazon's website and items from other marketplaces and selling channels.  \n.\n9. **62 million tons of paper and cardboard waste** in the US ends up in landfills, which accounts for around 56% of the 110 million tons manufactured each year, according to a study from the US Department of Energy. The estimated market value of paper and cardboard lost to landfilling in 2019 was $4B.   \n.\n10. **Walmart's PhonePe** launched an India mobile app store called \u201cIndus Appstore\u201d to challenge the dominance of Google's Play Store in the country. Indus Appstore features over 200k apps including Flipkart, Spotify, and Paytm, supports third-party payments and will not levy any listing fees for one year.   \n.\n11. Google stopped allowing users to generate images of humans with its **Gemini AI** tool last week after people complained that it produced pictures of Black founding fathers, a female pope, and gay couples when you asked it to create images of straight couples. Google aims to avoid bias in the output of its AI tools, but attempting to remove stereotypes has caused them to \u201cmiss the mark,\u201d according to Google.   \n.\n12. In other AI news at Google, the company introduced **Gemma**, a family of lightweight open AI models built from the same research and technology used to create Gemini, to compete with Meta's Llama 2 and other open source large language models. While Gemini is a closed AI model that directly competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the lightweight Gemma will be suitable for smaller tasks like simple chatbots or summarizations.   \n.\n13. **Cart.com** began offering its order management software solution as a standalone product. The Constellation Order Management System allows merchants to unify orders and inventory across multiple channels and was previously only available as part of Cart.com's unified commerce and logistics solution, but is now available to merchants on all e-commerce platforms.   \n.\n14. **DoorDash** agreed to pay $375k to settle claims that it broke California's privacy laws by giving away customers' info without their consent and without giving them the opportunity to opt-out. The company also agreed to review its technology and contracts with marketing and analytics vendors to confirm it's sharing or selling information legally.   \n.\n15. **BigCommerce** launched a new video series called B2B Bites, which will offer a curated collection of videos featuring wisdom from B2B industry leaders. The new series will feature expert interviews, how-to guides, trend analysis, and success stories with topics ranging from how to prepare your business for an exit to how to optimize your site for SEO.   \n.\n16. **Zilch**, the UK-based BNPL firm, launched a new credit payment product called \u201cPay Over 3 Months,\u201d which is designed for larger purchases such as buying electronics, car tires, or home repairs. The new offering has already been tested by over 100k customers, and the company plans to roll it out to 3.6M users in April.   \n.\n17. **AfterShip** enabled Apple Wallet Order Tracking, which allows users to receive delivery updates in real time through their Apple Wallets. Customers can activate the new feature by clicking the Track with Apple Wallet button on a merchant's order confirmation page or within e-mail and SMS order confirmations.   \n.\n18. **Walmart** and **Amazon** are facing legal trouble over the points-based attendance systems (which are kinda like Shrute Bucks) they use to track worker absences, which resulted in the firing of multiple employees. In the lawsuit, fired workers accuse the companies of violating their employment rights by terminating them after they took legally protected time for sick, medical, or pregnancy-related leave.   \n.\n19. **Zomato**, the Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery company, is planning to expand its 10-minute delivery platform, Blinkit, by adding products from various categories, which would put the company in direct competition with Amazon and Flipkart. The company plans to build its supply chain to directly source products and manage stock and is already in talks with individual brand owners to stock up on inventory.   \n.\n20. **Meta** expanded its Instagram Creator Marketplace tool to eight new markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Japan, India, Brazil, and Chinese export brands. The Creator Marketplace initially launched in 2022 as a means to help connect US-based brands with Instagram influencers for in-app partnership opportunities, and now advertisers will gain access to a wider variety of creators who can help expand their target audiences.   \n.\n21. **Google** confirmed a bug with using negative search operators within Google Shopping, which is a way to exclude words from your search results. Google is aware of the issue and working on a fix, but as of now, it's not resolved.   \n.\n22. **Credit card debt in the US** is now at record levels, reaching over $1.13 trillion, and interest rates on those cards have soared. This number does not include the growing debt of BNPL platforms, since these loans are often not reported to credit agencies.   \n.\n23. **Indonesia** issued regulation requiring digital platforms like Meta and Google to pay media outlets that provide them with content, which the country says is part of its efforts to ensure media companies \u201care not eroded\u201d by digital platforms. A committee will be formed to ensure digital platforms fulfill their responsibilities to the media companies. Google said it will review the regulation, and Facebook did not respond to comment.   \n.\n24. **Amazon** is now offering new gifts bags with handles in the US and EU, which are made from 100% recycled material and can be reused for future uses. The new bags still have the dual drawstrings, and you can stuff the handles down inside the bag, since they are attached from the inside, if you prefer the classic gift bag look.   \n.\n25. **Klarna** is launching a digital verification service called \u201cSign in with Klarna\u201d that is designed to speed up consumer login to e-commerce sites and apps in 23 countries including the US. On registration, the customer chooses what data they'd like to share with the store and if they want to join their membership or loyalty programs.   \n.\n26. **Chinese livestreaming agencies** promised rising influencers fame and money, but ended up trapping them in multi-year contracts without giving the influencers the support they promised. Legal disputes are now on the rise as livestreamers attempt to leave their contracts, resulting in the agencies demanding money.   \n.\n27. **The US Department of Commerce** announced the designation of 31 Tech Hubs in regions across the country, as part of the first phase of its new economic development initiative designed to drive regional innovation and job creation. The program invests directly in burgeoning, high-potential US regions and aims to transform them into globally competitive innovation centers.   \n.\n28. **TikTok** is launching a \u201cStar Creator\u201d team to focus on finding and developing influencers who can drive sales to TikTok Shop. According to its job portal, the company is hiring for several new roles in the US and UK including a \u201cstar creator manager\u201d and a team lead focused on Shop creators who are good at selling fashion items.   \n.\n29. **UPS** is cutting sorting shifts in New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, as the delivery company continues to adjust to volume declines. The company did not say exactly how many employees would be let go, but stressed that the layoffs help them deliver \u201cindustry-leading service\u201d and maintain \u201ccompetitive prices.\u201d   \n.\n30. **Overstock.com** is planning to relaunch its store on Shopify in about five weeks, which it shut down last year after acquiring Bed Bath & Beyond's intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction for $20M in favor of operating on its business on BedBathandBeyond.com instead. Marcus Lemonis, executive chairman of the board, said that in hindsight, shutting down their website was a \u201cfatal mistake.\u201d  \n.\n31. Plus 8 e-commerce **seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions** of interest including Carewell, an e-commerce platform for caregiving products, raising $24.7M in a Series B round led by MBF Healthcare.  \n.\n\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

This is an opinion basis limited understanding. Pls be kind :)                                                               Started to feel that Deepinder is very risk averse - what was that on and off with the deal he invested.. have two options but toola way one . he got restless, stood up and asked for advice.... He is a great advisor but is he really a shark. Again the same point - why would he sign up for this when we cannot invest in brands on blinkit  and food business... I understand this is basis the limited pitch discussion they show and the actual pitches for on for long. ..                                secondly I felt with complex products such as drones, the hydrogen car..  the Sharks go very clueless and dont even attempt to understand the product. There is a mad craze for consumer products because of business viability .. but in the the hydro car product Aman and deepinder were almost silent. .","137":"What's new in e-commerce? \ud83d\udd25 Week of February 26th, 2024 Hi [r\/ShopifyeCommerce](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShopifyeCommerce\/) \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my [Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter](https:\/\/www.shopifreaks.com\/) \\-- which by the way hit 10k subscribers today!

Just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you, everything other than the air quality is better here. The food in (not just the mess) but most of the restaurants I have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine. Even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam. I have been to the biggest malls there, namely phoenix and R city, both of them pale in comparison to ambience, airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants. It was honestly a huge shock to me considering I had heard that mumbai is \"the best city\" . The fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something I did not expect .  Apart from the air quality, gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect . Truly blessed to have been raised here","143":"DMart user tries Zepto  \nI\u2019ve been an investor in DMart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from DMart for many years to ensure we stay self-sustainable \ud83d\ude02. I tried Zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact DMart in the long run. Here are my two cents:\n\n1. **Experience with Zepto**: It was really good and fast, and cheaper due to coupons, but not when compared to DMart's prices.\n\n2. **Will I buy from Zepto again?**  \n   Sure, I will. Who doesn\u2019t want a few quick deals in the name of a discount?\n\n3. **Will I continue investing in DMart or invest more?**  \n   Yes, I will. Until quick commerce burns VC capital, I\u2019ll stay invested. Once the business model is proven to fail, DMart will likely boom.\n\n**How long can VCs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption?**  \nOnly until the IPO, or six months after the IPO due to the lock-in period.\n\n\n**Updates:**\n\nMost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend Blinkit:\n\n**Usability of the application:**\n\n\n**1. Once people become accustomed to an app, they are unlikely to switch, even in the absence of discounts.**\n\nIn my view, this isn\u2019t entirely true, at least in India.\nFor example:\n\n\u2022 Recent news highlighted how Jio and Airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes.\n\n\u2022 How many of us stick to just one quick commerce app? Isn\u2019t it common to compare prices between Swiggy and Zomato before ordering food?\n\n\n**2. The elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price:**\n\nAgain, I\u2019m unsure how long this will hold true. The same elite crowd often shops at stores like Zudio and Westside for the in-store experience, rather than relying on online platforms like Myntra or Amazon.\n\n1. Personally, I used to buy meat from an online app for several years. However, after receiving stale meat once, I switched to buying meat directly from shops. These shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options.\n\n\nOne alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of over 315 for Zomato\u2014a tech company with a profit of just \u20b9250+ crores\u2014while being hesitant to invest in DMart, which has a profit exceeding \u20b9650+ crores and a much lower P\/E of 87.\n\nIn my opinion, the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor. However, how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer. Until then, I believe both quick commerce and brick-and-mortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar.

","145":"Moved from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar.. my experience  Jay Jagannath\n\nKichi dina tale there was a post about living conditions and work conditions in Bangalore. And the language barrier there. \n\nDon\u2019t remember the expost but people were arguing about which place is better than other\n\nWell I shifted from Bangalore to Bhubaneswar on 1st July after staying there for 3 years.\n\nHere are some observations:\n\nPros of Living in Bangalore:\n1. Fast paced life. People work hard and you do the same.\n2. You see successful people there and that helps you work harder too.\n3. You get a better pay over there.\n4. The weather is \u2764\ufe0f\n5. The language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\nCons of living in Bangalore:\n1. The city kind of lost its heart. You don\u2019t get too many people ready to help. You hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers.\n2. Too many ways to lose money. Whether its the Convenience of zepto, blinkit or the expensive goods over there, you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3. The quality of water and food is not as great.\n4. Traffic is \u274c\n5. Some spots where you see the language problems, it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nBut Bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\nPros:\n1. The heart. I never lived in Bhubaneswar. My hometown is in Keonjhar. The can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber, an electrician and a carpenter for the house. For no reason at all.\n2. The price of basic commodities. In Bangalore, my per day expenses would be \u20b91500 for the family. This includes food groceries, petrol etc. Here I spend less than \u20b9500 for me and my wife. Things are way cheaper here.\n3. Closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before.\n4. Everyone knows odia. Its so much easier to communicate \n5. The food. People here have no idea how rare authentic Odia food is in other states.\n\nCons:\n1. Every service provider (carpenter, plumber etc) delays their project for no reason. The AC installation guys came late. (12pm ish after promising 9 am) took a break in middle.. went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2. The weather is so much more humid. Its hotter here. Irritating between 10 am to 4 pm. I just have to adjust to this.\n3. Not a lot of dog friendly areas. Its rare here. \n\n\nThat\u2019s about it.\n\nI tried to be as objective as possible.\n\nThe reason I moved here was because I was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t regret one bit.\n\nLike I said.\n\nThe heart of our people is something I love.","146":"Need suggestions from the gym peeps here...

For me, Reddit is like a version of Instagram+Personal diary and I hope others enjoy these posts as much as I enjoy reading others. :)\n\nI did buy some of them recently. Those have been marked in the review.\n\n\nHow I judge nail polish:\n\nMy polish must stay intact for a week. I do my own chores and they shouldn't budge. I don't expect them to last more than a week. I reapply them on the weekends.\n\nMy advice: \n\nApplying a coat of glitter polish on top of regular polish helps you keep the nail polish on for longer. There's some glue(ish) substance on the Glitter polish will prevent the nail polish from chipping. I don't usually apply clear top coats.\n\nFor matte polish, apply a single coat on the weekends and reapply a single coat when it chips throughout the week. That's the best way to make them last.\n\n\nPersonal comment:\n\nLighter colors take many coats to stay and it stains. Darker colors are much easier to wear.\n\n\nMy reviews by brands:\n\n1. Plum:\n\nIn the picture: color affair apri-caught and twilight mauve, purple mist and 3-in-1\n\nReview:\nThe Glitter collection is very long lasting.\n\nThe transparent polish is okay. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe non-glitter Color affairs are not worth the money. They will chip.\n\n\n2. Renee:\n\nIn the picture: Glitterati Purple Galaxy, Glitterati Lunar Eclipse (Friday Haul), Hypergel Aubergine Purple (Friday Haul)\n\nReview:\n\nThe Glitter polish purple looks awesome when applied. I bought the other two to try, and will soon.\n\n\n\n3. Sugar Pop:\n\nReview: \n\nAwful. These peel like glue. I had bought them in some sale and I gave away the others. I would not recommend them.\n\n\n4. Faces Canada:\n\nIn the picture: Ultimate pro splash Viola, Luxe Amethyst (Friday Haul), Iris (Friday Haul), Purple Rain, Ginger, Nutty (Friday Haul)\n\nReview:\n\nLove them. I'm one of those people who remebers that Faces had a purple nail polish called Date Night and had a multi color glitter before Shanghai Shimmer. I love Faces nail polish. Their quality hasn't changed much (or at least I don't notice it).\n\n\n\n5. Lakme:\n\nIn the picture: Absolute Poison (the bottle was attacked by my hair straightner and it survived. Those are victory scars), 9to5 Summer blue, Purple Magic (one is a Friday Haul), Lavender breeze, True Wear shade 507\n\nReview: \n\nAbsolute and 9to5 are definitely worth it. True Wears are good if you don't have any other option, else skip it.\n\n\n6. Juice:\n\nIn the picture: Purple diva and  S18, S28, S26, S37 (the small ones are Friday Haul)\n\nLoved the bigger one hence bought more this Friday. It stayed for a week and it served it's purpose which is to keep my polish on for a week. Will review the smaller ones later.\n\n\n7. Swiss Beauty:\n\nIn the picture: High shine glitter 10, Pop up 17 and Stunning Nail Lacquer Purple Gift.\n\nReview:\n\nJust no. Don't waste your money on SB nail polish.\nThe first two smells the most funky. The last one doesn't perform better than Lakme or Faces. And price wise they aren't quite cheap either.\n\n\n8. Random Collection:\n\n8.1 : Colorbar nail polish Black Diamond:\n\nThis is a very old polish and probably it's not available anymore. This peels like glue and it's the reason why I never bought any Colorbar polish.\n\nI don't know if they have changed their formula.\n\n\n8.2 : Odiva gel finish polish Velvetine (Friday Haul) :\n\nNew, hence no review.\n\n\n8.3 : Lotus Ecostay Plum Play: \n\nIt's good. The color is bright. No complaints. I might try more of Lotus.\n\n\n8.4: Coloressence Theme for Dream (new, bought it from Blinkit, now you get Nail polish in 15min\ud83d\ude05):\n\nYet to try.\n\n\n8.5: Verymiss Rose Bud Cherry:\n\nIt's matte. It's so matte that it even turns glossy top coats (Plum one) matte.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI kind of like it... Though I'm not sure.\n\n\n8.6: Nykaa:\n\nIn the picture: Even ridge filler and matte top coat:\n\nReview: I had a lot of Nykaa polishes. They don't last, period. Who here has the patience to color their nails every day?! A hard pass to all Nykaa polishes.\n\n\n\nFavorite nail polish remover: Colorbar remover.

I'm planning to incorporate chicken into my diet, mainly to up my protein intake but I've never handled it in the kitchen before. I've eaten it in restaurants though. So mainly my confusion revolves around the following aspects:\n\n1. Which place is better to buy chicken: local butcher or apps like zepto, blinkit, liscious etc. on the basis of quality, price, and any other metrics that may be necessary?\n\n\n2. I would prefer to buy from a local butcher because I'm trying to curb reliance over apps, supporting local yada yada. In this case, what do I say to the butcher? I don't want to sound completely clueless. What cut, size, weight etc to ask for? How to ensure safety and quality standards are being met? And how to know if I'm being fooled or ripped off?\n\n\n3. I mostly plan to buy a bulk quantity that can be safely preserved in the freezer and can be thawed and cooked as needed over 4-5 days. Is this even feasible? What quantity can I buy and freeze for the maximum possible duration such that it doesn't go bad?\n\n\n4. How to tell if the chicken is undercooked? Is the pinkishness the only way? Any tips and tricks to not undercook or overcook the chicken or is it only learnt by experience? \n\n\n5. What are the easiest and quickest ways to cook chicken? I don't think a curry would be possible on week days because of a hectic schedule. I'm mainly thinking chicken soup or small peices on tawa. Would I have to buy an air fryer for this? \n\n\n6. Are there any other important things that I'm missing that I need to take care of when working with chicken? \n\n\nApologies for the laundry list of questions, I have tried googling, searching YouTube but I didn't find a definitive answer especially on the buying part.

salad options again only one brand is there that too never available online i mean this is so upsetting to see that people here are still not getting rich healthy options available online i wish to see this city growing in terms of healthy living cleanliness more job oriented  uhh just saw a bigbasket now billboard in boring road that promises \u0921\u0932\u0935\u0930\u091c within 10 minutes

has always delivered fresh fruits vegetables and chickenfish cant say anything about meat\n\nthe varieties available maybe a little less when it comes to packaged items but bigbasket comes in handy in this situation i have personally been able to order a lot of niche items or healthier alternatives thru bigbasket that i used to consume back in bangalore and pune\ndeleted\nswiggy and zomato is flourishing in patna \n\nthey should start delivering groceries too\n\ni dont know why instamart and zepto is not here","4":"my fragrance collection  random hotwheels car i found i started this

possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is

this and i finished a whole bottle of it within a year sweet dark and fresh smelling but this new bottle just isnt as strong and performace sucks barely lasts 30 minutes idk if they changed its

and sporty wouldve been ranked way higher if it performed barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection\n\n10 ustra scuba cologne\nthis is the only fragrance in my collection i actually despise

are teaming up to launch a new cobranded card its got the potential to bring some serious perks to your daily life blending food groceries and movie deals all in one but heres the big question which bank should they partner with to make this card truly amazing\n\nshould they go with a banks like sbi or icici for their extensive network and customer base or perhaps a fintech innovator that could bring a fresh approach to the table or is there another bank you think would be a perfect fit for this collaboration\n\ndrop your thoughts and ideas below what bank would you choose and why lets see which partnership has the most potential \ud83c\udf1f once upon a time zomato had partnered with rbl bank for a cobranded card but it went disastrously bad and they had to completely shut down the card the offers and cashback on the card were too good to be sustainable so they gradually devalued the card and eventually closed it down they had offered life time free zomato gold subscription as well as far as you have the card active but eventually suspended the offer when they have to shut the whole card \n\nthe trust factor is pretty low on a zomato branded card now and it would take a whole lot of efforts to bring the same back\nicici should get it as it doesnt have many good cobranded cards apart from amazon cc\nthis is worded like a product manager at zomato asking this question\nindusind bank top tier banking infra with top notch customer service s\nhdfc and its not even a question other banks fumble so hard on cobranded cards sbi reliance card is dog shit adani icici also comes to mind in that dog shit tier\n\nhdfc has two successful cobranded cards hdfc neu and swiggy then can go with axis too considering how well airtel axis performs","11":"pros and cons of living in hydrabad im sharing my thoughts on pros and cons am from the north shifted from delhi ncr last year\n\ncons  \n1 little to no weekend getaway options 23 din ki chutti mil jaye get so confused ki kya karein bencho\n2 not a con as suggested correctly by several in comments far away from hometown for people from north have to plan and spend about 50k on travel plans alone by flight or if by train be ready to spend 45 days on travel alone\n3 north indian sweets are less in options those selling dont have the same taste id almost kill for om sweets ki rabri rasmalai the best desi sweet of all times period\n4 the traffic is a nightmare but its similar to gurgaon if not worse also brings it to a standstill after heavy rains more of an indian metro issue than just hyd\n5 never faced any water issues in the whole north india here specially the new city area hitech city was a barren land so come peak summers very significant water problem have to completely rely on water tankers which adds up to rent costs\n6 gated society flat rent and buy rates are eye watering much high than delhi nsr but there is also a positive mentioned in pros below\n7 ola and uber demand far exceeds the supply and forget uber or ola money never put balance in it instead keep upi handy every damn auto or bike guy has a qr code ready with them or keep cash but upi is of course more convenient you have to have at least a 2wheeler for your convenience peak hours mein its a pain to get an auto or even a bike public transport is very bad old rickety lopsided buses\n8 flouting traffic rules is the past time of hyderabad go to old hyderabad and you will see more people without helmets than with i used to be pissed off at every wrong side no helmet rider but have learned to be more careful and patient myself and accept this lawlessness lol\n\npros  \n1 the weather is hot till may then it starts raining cats and dogs from june so no heat till next year march cant imagine a single night without ac in june or july in the north\n2 a heaven for foodies the non veg kind specially the biryani the curries and the andhra cuisine is excellent\n3 tha cafe and restaurant options are unlimited and varied the cafe culture is excellent you can go to a local cafe and enjoy talking with your friends for hours imagine a more accessible and unpretentious starbucks experience in almost any residential locality \n4 local bakeries are very nice have a good sale so the produce is fresh i have stopped ordering bread from blinkit\n5 the dhinchak dakhini hindi dialect is commonly used and the assholery like bangalore is not here yes forcing others to learn a language unless they themselves feel the need due to issues in communicating by abusing northerners in an auto cab or anywhere outside is plain assholery in my book so you can easily live here if you know hindi\n6 you can wear whatever the fuck you want 365 days a year i have seen fully burka clad and short skirt wearing ladees in my office and have purposefully tried to see if any men are leering at the skirt wali grills honestly out of 10 only 1 or 2 stare which is saying a lot compared to the way majority would rpe with eyes in delhi ncr \n7 you can eat whatever whenever the fuck you want no closing of meat selling businesses for whole weeks or months people hindus and muslims both will come on street if there is any ban on buying or selling any kind of food we love our food and the freedom to eat it\n8 politically they hate bjp and congress equally hate congress because majority hyderabadis being brs fanbois and congress won from the semi urban and rural telangana and have heard big electricity cuts in several places in hyd since they came to power bjp because they see whats happening in the north and dont want it to happen in hyderabad\n9 very safe city girls can roam around in late evening without fear of eve teasing or worse\n10 it is also a pretty clean city not in the leagues of indore chandigarh etc but much cleaner than the whole delhi ncr\n11 i said gated society rent and buy rates are eye watering but people majorly live in standalone building with ease this is because of bare minimum crime rates one can live with family in a standalone building with peace of mind cant even think of the same in gurgaon\n\nall in all this is honestly the countrys best metro right now i plan to settle completely have my kids assimilate into the culture learn telugu my kids and i and become native hydra baddies asap im a hyderabadi and have lived in gurgaon briefly the relative comparison looks on point except that for sweets do explore a bit more in hyderabad \n\nthat aside youve covered other aspects accurately in terms of comparison\nbruh 2 really i mean you made the choice of coming here its like me going to us and saying india is far hardly a con\n\n3 i dont think sweets are less in option dadus have pretty good sweets and haldirams and bikanerwale are franchise which is present in north as well maybe not the better than delhi but does a good job coming close shouldnt be an issue per say \n\nalso there is a lot of place you can go for the weekend there are many resorts could go to warangal karnoolvizag if its a long weekend \n\nother than these you are pretty apt just that its pov of someone from hi tech city area hyderabad is much more than the it area the rent and all reduces in secunderabad area by a lot\nbro kudos to you for analyzing the city so well that too just in year i agree with all the pros and disagree with few cons\nfor sweetsdesserts go and try below\nrabadirasmalai  mahalakshmi in kachiguda\nif you are a kaju barfi fan go to balaji ratanlal kachighda\nseethafal malai or any other authentic malai desserts go to milan fruit center charminar\napricot delight  narsing boggulakunta\negg pudding papaji ka dhaba boggulakunta\nand i am sure some 100 more other unique options just in and around hyd \ud83d\ude00 \ud83e\udd17\ngo to begam bazar you will go mad with all the north indian style deserts bun maska bun malai\nhyderabad is not delhi that is summarized version of your problems \n\nwhy would you find north indian food here im from maharashtra but i dont expect misal vadpav here \n\nive found people from north india having a hard time adjusting to southern cities dont know why the lack of parantha shouldnt cause this much withdrawal symptoms\n2nd point isnt a con \n3rd point  explore a little more","12":"took me by surprise ordered from blinkit for instant delivery as a filler till my beans arrive\n\ninitial impressions with paper filter fp was not great some chocolaty notes but finishing with oaky bitterness\n\ntried with v60 and man it surprised me with the taste cant believe this supermarket coffee with packing date going back 5 plus months can tatste this good with nice brown sugar chocolate mild spice notes almost at par with bts of the world idk whats lavazza doing here i generally dont have high hopes from them but went for it thinking at least it is 100 arabica unlike gusto crema  classico \n\ndefinitely not recommended from freshness perpective but tin can packaging made me give it a shot \n\nfeel free to drop in your experience if youve tried this before this is preground right i wish they had whole beans of this want to try in mokapot\ngood to see an australian cookies enjoyer\nthe issue with preground coffee is that freshness takes a deep dive once you open the pack i bet the coffee which youll have 5 days later will not be as good as the coffee you had on day 1\non a separate note cookie man has best cookies ngl","13":"is hsbc live not offering 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions hey fellow credit card enthusiasts\n\ni recently picked up the hsbc live credit card which comes with one of the highest fees ive paid so far999  gst\n\na significant portion of my spending goes towards groceries especially for items like milk fruits and veggies i usually shop on flipkart bigbasket via tataneu jiomart and amazon fresh with the occasional order from swiggy instamart ill also use dmart ready blinkit or zepto if theres a great discount\n\ni had been using the following cards earlier\n flipkart axis ltf for 5 on flipkart grocery\n bb gift cards bought at 1025 discount on bb tataneu for smaller transactions or tataneu infinityltf for 10 instant discount  10 neucoins\n axis acechargeable on jiomart for 15 cashback \n hdfc millennialtf amazon pay icici ltf for amazon fresh\n hdfc swiggyltf for 10 cashback for swiggy instamart\n axis ace chargeable for 15 for dmart ready\n\nafter making a few transactions i reached out to hsbc customer care to confirm cashback eligibility they informed me that my jiomart purchases qualify for the 10 cashback which is great however my flipkart transactions are only earning the regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a higher cart value which might not always be feasible for my purchases\n\ndoes anyone else with the hsbc live card have experience with flipkart grocery cashback any advice or solutions would be appreciated\n\nalso would like to know how you guys make the most of grocery transactions in order to save both time and money no flipkart grocery doesnt fall under grocery mcc so no 10 cb\ni think its only for some items for me dmart wins for most of the grocery items just compared 3 l saffola gold oil in dmart ready app its rs 415 and flipkart the same is rs 509 \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\nalso you cannot do much in this case what the card classifies for the rewards its upto them try with customers care call and

recently the leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company zomato announced an initiative food rescue to limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their mamma got

amazon  it gets delivered by amazon fresh which is crap so earlier amazon used to clearly demarcate if your order will be delivered by amazon fresh or amazon i have always had terrible experience with amazon fresh and hence never used to order from amazon fresh lately i have learnt that the so called rush delivery whereby they ask you to choose time slots for delivery are actually handled by amazon fresh\n\ntwice i opted for rush deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so called rush deliveries are handled by amazon fresh i then realized why they were getting delayed amazon fresh has always been crap since day 1 the worst part is they wont even let you cancel an amazon fresh order even if it has not been dispatched \n\nso if you are ordering something from amazon never choose any of the time slots your order will be then handled by amazon fresh and you will be sorry you chose them\n\nas a side note always check the item on blinkit before ordering from amazon their sku has expanded significantly the order which was delayed by amazon fresh i checked it on blinkit and got it in 5 minutes meanwhile the original amazon order is now more than 36 hrs old and there is no option to cancel it on amazon i really wonder how they amazon fresh are still alive as a division never had good experience with amazon fresh better stick to blinkit or bb","31":"fresh strawberries in jaipur hey everyone\n\nive recently moved to jaipur

culture ft zepto i have been working with zepto for a year now it is the most toxic work culture i want to post this now because it has lots of publicity but only we know how bad things are\n\n aadit starts work only at 2pm because he cannot wake up early and meetings are setup at 2am in the mornings because of that\n people start work only at 12pm and because of this hr is trying to give free breakfast so people start work at 10 and finish work at least 11pm in the night\n all meetings are delayed no meetings happen on time and keep getting postponed including townhalls \n a lot of youngsters are hired because senior people do not want to work in such a culture and these people are made to work 14 hours a day at least \n there are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n customer data is profiled and security is really bad and despite multiple leaks fixing this is not important because of growth and investor pressures \n the marketing person is also the hr head now and its very clear that culture is not important for the org and cost cutting and layoffs are going to start by march \n the tech teams work until 1am and many are seen having tablets to stay awake since there are lot of young people they do not care much about health\n junior people are hired so salaries can be cut and in march there will be a massive round of layoffs and already hiring is stopped for most departments\n the product design tries desperately to copy from blinkit and they keep checking what blinkit does to match it\n a lot of fake data is given to media and employees are encouraged to keep posting this material on linkedin even social media copies and images are given to employees to help with pr \n there are massive cases of fraud that i cant disclose without revealing my position \n at least 10 people leave the company every week and 20 more young people are hired\n yearly performance appraisal is going to be cancelled and only some are going to get awarded with minor hikes\n many that i know are only staying because there can be an ipo in 2 years and we can make money because of that bold of u to post bro  this shit should go viral\na friend left zepto a while ago can vouch for everything above \n\nadditionally\n\n the workplace is a cesspool of politics someone in your team will try to take credit for your work \n massive funding is leading to massive hiring the cultural fit is not present in the teams\n because there is massive hiring there is no room to grow or get promotions to upper roles because people have been already hired for them\n their employee churn ratio is abysmal\nthere are lot of dark patterns in the app to extract money from customers in multiple ways including charging more for customers with phones more than 30000 inr\n\nwell this is outright illegal as per both \n\n consumer protection act 2019\n the information

as per boat official website also the qr code which is on the box which asks to scan for checking authenticity says that the serial number is invalid\n\nwhen contacted blinkit customer support kept me on hold for 30 mins and then replied that they deliver only authentic products they cant do anything more about it due to ststem limitations \n\nwondering how blinkit is delivering fake products and shutting down user complaints just like that\n\n\nupdate after hours of customer support chat email escalations and a consumer court threat they finally agreed to refund blinkit person just came and collected the return i got a notification that refund is being processed and will be credited within 4 working days\n\nthanks for all your support inputs and making me not settle with the feeling that i got cheated you all are the best \u2764 i cant believe the comments if it was an iphone people would be up at arms and urging op to take action you dont have to be rich and order only expensive products to get what you ordered \n\nit doesnt matter which brand you ordered blinkit is supposed to deliver the original product escalate it and if needed file a case in consumer court\nthe comments are more focused on the quality of boat rather than the issue with blinkit\n\nif you can get the customer support email send an escalation email\njust send a mail to them saying you will be going to

ordering online ive heard adult toys are illegal in india i keep seeing mymuse products on zepto and blinkit but im not sure if its safe to order from these sites i dont want to get into trouble is the delivery discrete and how do you remove it from order history i live in a pg and the zepto delivery always calls me and then just drops packages with the guard at the gate i dont want the guard or other girls to find out anyone whos ordered these before can you let me know if i should order from zepto then dont call it a toy maintain the marketed nomenclature of a massager \n\ni dont think anyone gives a damn even if they get to know that youre using a massager for toe curling fun unless they get ideas of forcibly including themselves into the scene with yourself  for which the only solution is to contact the seller and ensuring that they have a discreet packing\n\nand whats more important than the toy is that you get a good anti bacterial lotion to regularly clean it\nhave you

products deepinder regularly says no to investing in food companies because he says theres conflict of interest but blinkit sells many food products of its own brand like amazons amazon basics isnt there conflict of interest then or are there different rules regarding both cases since there are few posts related to this subject without much clarification i will try to answer based on my understanding \n\n blinkit would be selling products which provides best margin customer retention etc for the business and ultimately the profit to the shareholders of zomato \n\n now throw dipinders acquired products in the mix there will always be some partiality leading to the conflict between his acquired products vs public company that he is leading","46":"local shops vs blinkit price

have made us lazy to the core \nfor daily essentials i found it to be comparable to local and with card discount its too lucrative to miss\nall these 10 minutes are for emergency times only like koi guests ajaye chai ke sath biscuit ni hai or sudden craving or processed food bahar ni jana and all  i guess bahar jao outing bhi hogi physical plus mental health in check\ntoys and all ka idea nhi coz

worrying whether swiggy or zomata or other quick commerce companies will perform i just sit back and invest in companies that provide packaging papers to these companiesproxy companies seriously why ruin my mental health by having misgivings about the risedownfall of certain quick commerce companieswhether swiggyblinkit or zepto will ultimately become the market leader when i can just invest in a proxy company\n\nseeing the rise in quick commerce in india i decided to invest in a paper companywhich i will not name this is a multibagger in the makingfrom my pov  \n  \nyou know how you get your productsfood by an amazonswiggy delivery boy in a package right they supply this packaging paper and is a fundamentally strong companythe stock is also undervalued while these quick commerce companies

than the vaccine look out for ancillaries providing the glass and syringe for it \nwhen everyone is digging for gold this guy is selling shovels\nquiet wrong or correct approach means you need to understand\n\n1wrong approach  what can go wrong\n\n1when ever market goes down  the backend companies are most affected by recession\n\n2 the proxy companies can change there supplier anyday depending on there cost\n\n3 growth of suppliers is not as good as the proxy companies had\n\n4imp finding these companies is pretty hard and tricky most of the time you can get targeted by scams or hit by low performing asset\n\n2 the correct approach\n\n1the best way it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is not affected by the operations of a single one\n\n3good and well connected management unlike big companies here connections matter the most as the vendor need huge friend network inside big corporates to reach for there products\n\n3 benefits\n\n1 once business is well settled it will give really good benefits in long run\nso does it mean that pudumjee\u00a0is a monopoly or are there are also other players in the race\n\nanyhow i took a similar approach for ddev plastiks since the company makes cable compounds and plastic compounds that are used in cable and wire packaging footwear pipes automobiles consumer durables electrical appliances electrical and light fittings and electronics\n\nits also the only domestic player manufacturing coating compounds for 132 kv cables with rest being imported increasing house sales and infrastructures such as metro stations hospitals schools are the growth opportunities for this industry and company\n\nbut the share price is not going up and instead steadily decreasing any ideassuggestions regarding what approach i should take here\n\nim hoping for decent q2 results so that the share price increases a little and at least does not fall further","49":"tired of my business not growing im a soloprenuer\nive done a sale of 35 lakhs on amazon this year\nwe sell\nprotein bars with the making cost of 40 to make and we sell it at 160\nchips with the making cost of 50 and sp is 170 \n\nevery month feels like im spending more money than making it and ive no idea where am i going wrong \nive repeat customers and good reviews but hardly 10 reviews i only have money to make the products yes i make them myself and we do not have staff \n\npls help with advice  \nalso if anybody is interested in partnering up im more than happy to get into it \n\nps this is our 1 year on being on amazon \n\nedit our product is protein bar with 20g of protein and high quality ingredients and is zero sugar to fit into the keto category\n\nanyone suggesting blinkit and swiggy instamart please also send contacts if you have of these companies and know that they charge upto 1l per sku why did you start selling chocolates on amazon\ndo you think it would be better to sell chocolates directly on your website\n\nthis is my thought process\ni have never seen anyone buying chocolates from amazon until and unless it is for a gift purchase  your keywords should be around gifts\nhardly anyone would want to try new items and that too from amazon\nyou only have 10 reviews which is again quite low\n\nmy suggestion create an insta page if not created till now make some viral reels partner with micro influencers and direct customers to your websiteamazon listing if you dont have a website\ngather more reviews\n\nif you can bid on keywords wrt dairy milk gifts cadbury or other relevant keywords  use helium  do that\nits because your cost of production is too high in a country that offers protein bars for 20 and chips packets for 10 at retail points you cannot grow a business in this segment unless youre creating a legacy brand pricing and promotions are your biggest enemies a majority of indian consumers like cheap things which is why d2c companies find it so difficult to make profits on premium products\n\nill be brutally honest with you unless someone is putting a significant amount of investment into this to fix your production line and supply chain your best bet would be to either treat this as a side hustle or close it down and focus on building a different kind of a company dont waste the time that you wont get back after 10 years\ni would like to help you with your insta have you tried marketing your chocolates as protein bars or comparing it with other same price category chocolate side by side in a post format or ad format i can help with that though im not a professional but i know the basics of it\nyou can give better product at the same price or same product at lesser price\ncan you tell more about your products like what chocolates are they some gifting kind or something some info on customers too\n\nalso why not offline

various expenses like employee cost cost of materials etc but this chart shows that the company is in control of their expenses when you know what your expenses are you can maximize your sales growth \n\ncash position\n\nthe companys current assets are greater than its current liabilities which is a good sign also the company is continuously investing in rd and acquiring the rights to new products like horlicks vwash etc\n\nannual report of fy 2021\n\nthe lockdown affected many companies in 2020 but hul did the best during the pandemic it had acquired vwash and also horlicks by merging with

complaintask them to trace the customer basis details given by the delivery partner and get the phones back the phones will have location details iewhere these were last tracked this will give the police and you concrete proof then use this detail to lodge a formal fir for theft and wrongful hurt if need be if police does not want to convert it into fir and  customer is willing to pay

rapido  dark patterns in apps are becoming increasingly common these deceptive practices manipulate users into making decisions like overpaying for products subscribing to unnecessary services or revealing personal data\n\nheres a strategy to protect yourself\n\nuse a lowrange smartphone buy an inexpensive smartphone specifically for testing or using apps that you suspect might employ dark patterns\n\nget a new sim card register those apps with a new sim to keep your primary contact and data safe\n\n\ntest before you commit use these apps in a controlled way to see how their pricing or practices differ compared to your main device\n\n\nwhy this works some apps use tactics like price discrimination tracking or pushing inflated prices based on your phones model or usage patterns by using a budget device you might avoid being flagged as a highvalue target\n\n\ud83d\udca1 pro tip this is especially helpful for users in the age range of gen z as theyre frequent app users and are often targeted by dark patterns stay vigilant and always doublecheck before making purchases or commitments online\n\nhave you experienced dark patterns share your story below bhai jitna phone aur recharge mein chala jayega utna to order bhi nhi karta mai\nthanks for the feedback well also put the check on the delivery address \n\n zepto team\nso youre saying i gotta spend 10k on a phone and minimum 200 on a sim plan every month to save 5rs off of 1kg rice how does that even make sense\nop is the definition of penny wise  pound foolish\ni guess ill just go to the local kirana store for groceries from now on im too tired of purchasing more just to get a discount","61":"update on frozen fruit snack concept  so i posted about frozen fruit as a product in india and its market post 1 link \n\n\n\nso yesterday i tried to do it in a home freezer just to try it with flavours textures and feel of a frozen fruit\n\ni got kiwi and dragon fruit\n\ni cut them into beautiful small cubes added 4 flavours \n\n1 dairy milk chocolate which i melted and put few drops over the cube \n2 honey\n3 red chillies and salt\n4 lime \n\nand put them into freezer \n\nafter few hours i tried them the one with dairy milk was awesome i liked honey one too \n\nchilies were too much and lime was there or not i have no clue because kiwi was sour maybe off season or something\n\noverall noted few things \n\n1 you cant eat frozen fruit directly it just like an ice cream difference is you lick ice cream most of the time or its creamy but fruit is like an ice cube it was hard have to give some time to eat after putting them out of freezer\n\n2 so i got some 20 pieces overall because i wanted to get taste test done from my family members and as we were eating and discussing they started to melt again weather problem india is too hot and humid \n\n3 add on flavours started to melt away as well\n\n4 although fruit was able to maintain there texture and taste plus point so it does increase shelf life if done properly\n\n5 cutting a fruit properly to maintain equal size is difficult and time consuming and as well it creates wastage \n\n6 dragon fruit is a f tasteless fruit not the first time eating it i am having it since childhood and kiwi is moslty sour \n\nit doesnt mean i am giving up on the idea i will do some more rd and with basic fruit as well kiwi and dragon fruit is kinda expensive as well not widely available or likeable fruit in india \n\ni ordered frozen strawberry too it was available on blinkit and it was tasteless i love strawberries i eat them a lot but it was hard to consume it was more suitable for smoothie or as toppings thats why most brand do only berries as frozen fruit \n\ni will try again with the sample in few weeks with full research this time and preparation and hopefully come up with crazy combos and ways to make it more flavourful and easy to bite \n\nif you have any suggestions or ideas or a roast or anything would love to hear them out \n\nthank you for the time  how about smoothie pre mixes\njust buy and blend it all to drink it\u00a0\n\nyou can experiment a lot with it\u00a0\nyou can target high protein frozen smoothie mix vegan smoothie experiment with different flavors etc etc\n\nbut they cant just buy from supermarket then go back home and blend it asap to drink it right that is just not a good product\n\nwhat if you can install a small machine where they can just fit the cup and it blends it right then and there and now they can enjoy an on the go healthy snack\n\ni for sure would buy it if i am out because i dont really like eating outside food and prefer something organic\n\nnot sure about majority indians\nsomething you like doesnt mean that whole market will like it try all your final products to your family and friend circle its food taste not code so reddit wont help much in terms of real feedback\nthe world has generally gone the other way  ex fruits like nutsraisins inside chocolate\n\nif you want to be truly unique go triple layer cream inside fruit inside chocolate\nseen first post and now secondtry more mainstream i would say\nhave you given a thought to inject the flavour \n\nlike if i could inject my apple with honey or inject watermelon with masala water\n\ni know for now these are fairy tales but hey even i havent tried it yet soi hope you try it and give me a feedback\n\nedit read your first post if this iced thing becomes a deserttoh shaadiyo me use kr skte hai na \n\nwaha indian will pay 3x for food if it elevates there izzat","62":"do you use an egg boiler hi folks i

competitive market\n\nthey need to highly work in the product before the marketing not having a moat is hurting them in a longterm which im sure they know in the last few months i have seen more 89 switch from zepto to blinkit in family and friends\n\nzepto does have a loyal customer base but its smaller\n\ni dont know how zepto can miss the customer behaviour point because of which they are facing the high churn rate even though its normal for startups like at this stage due many factors like experimenting with pricing user experience and more\n\nif the plan is selling zepto to zomeone or to amazon then i have to say its really interesting to see them moving forward so agressively which make sense considering its an infrastructure game i dont see any acquisition play in the near future\n\nzepto is primarily negative because of investments in infrastructure not on transactional level \n\nuser experience would vary on city level considering that there is still a lot of manpower and operations required to drive qc\nas in industry insider i can say that zepto is doing quite well they operate in less than half the city as the other players but they still have 25 market share and growing theyre burning money but so in instamart but zepto has a warchest and theyre using it well theyll soon be the second largest player if instamart doesnt buckle up they need not sell but yeah if they do want to sell its hot property\nuntil the investor money lasts\nzepto already tried to sell to flipkart but they asked for more price and they rejected so flipkart started their own

this youll love my 3min newsletter \ud83d\udd17 in comment i wouldnt call mamaearth a startup anymore at this point theyre a fully fledged dropshipper like boat noise boult audio at this point with a 1000 employee team either way it is a very shitty business with a very small barrier to entry if these people stop marketing their products theyre unlikely to beat unilever with their game with brands such as lakm\u00e8 sunsilk glow  lovely glow  handsome clinic plus ponds clear and others\n\noutside of unilever theres lor\u00e8al maybelline vlcc and emami who can generate far better profitability and brand recall and inhouse cosmetics and rd spend on introducing new products\n\nmamaearth is like micromaxkarbonlava of cosmetics industry the point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as amazon or reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of noname low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as amazon basics solimo etc\nmamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products if you make subpar products you wont last in the market why would i buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available for any cosmetic brand if you dont have repeat customers you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it\nthe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from amazon\n\ni really dont understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy its share\n\nthey really dont have anything new or niche \nanywhere good luck to them and their individual investors\nhow can quick commerce be competition they sell through thay channel\n\nblinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nbaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so i doubt it will get any better\n\nthey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\ndirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of tapping into price conscious market\nprofit kamaye mera l pehle insta pe thoda naach gaan

orders but it seems their cod experience is even worse than prepaid ig they automatically give low priority to cod all my cod orders are either cancelled or not delivered on their mentioned date even with prime all this is happening\n\none thing i have noticed the time slots delivery are never accurate on most apps now a days what is a guy supposed to do i they need a product the same day sigh ig

just me\npast three orders they did a fake delivery attempt someones trying to fulfill their metrics just horrible\ni agree i live in mumbai and since the last one year if my order value is under 2k i get the product at 101030 in the night if its a high value product that requires otp then it is delivered during the day i have complained about this in amazon but nothing happened\nits been a while

i havent seen them in any brick and mortar retail store either so what happened to them they seemed very promising then sold to reliance\nthey are still there check on blinkit have signed shikhar

and take the rest of money but he refused when i said let me talk to your manager he also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r more 20 orders and the manager wants to talk to u so he took me and my friend there it was cleared that they going to ask me money since i didnt know there language they even didnt wanted my friend to come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry

am a jobless they asked out jobs bc they think they can ask for more money so they even told both of us to show our bank account and they were shocked to see that we didnt have any money somehow my friend end up making them agreed on 2k and i asked from my parents and give it to them and asked them to delete the video but they refused then my friend told the manager to delete the video and then they deleted it i am just too shocked from the experience bc idk if i was wrong or right because i was just following my friend lead they even hit us and tried to fight with us i just wanted to share this bc the thing havent gone this far if the zomato had improved there customer support you did kinda wrong by placing multiple orders and refusing it \n\nim not saying they were right what they did

last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials

price is too good to pass on shall i get it do i have to worry about the version or quality blinkit hasnt let me down before\n\n ","96":"please rate my high level design for instamartzeptoblinkit hi guys im practicing for system design interviews and created a hld for instamartblinkit please review it and suggest some points im open for a feedback thanks\n\nfollowing is the link for excalidraw diagram  \n\n\n \n\nthe user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and then once the dp location receives this information it then stores it in redis\n\nall of the components can be scaled horizontally\n\ninstamart system design\n\n namaste\nthanks for submitting to

across an idea that seems very niche yet in the grand scheme of things it can be a brilliant productservice users probably dont know they needed it but they do if its executed correctly\n\ni have been building a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading  in general i hate the tam discussion because vcs use it to kill investment right away its an easylogical no from them \n\nin reality its a double edged sword airbnb and uber both started with tiny tams and found ways to grow into massive businesses cocacola expanded their tam once they started to view themselves as a fnb company not just a soda company \n\nbut its hard to build a big business with a nonexistent tam you should run some numberswhat is a reasonable som obtainable market how big can that business be \n\nthen you need a story on how youll expand into a larger tam\nunderstanding your tam is important as is your unit economics\u00a0\n\ndo you want to build a startup as opposed to just starting a business where you dont need to raise capital and dont intend to hire more than a handful of people\n\nif you want to build a startup your tam needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage but not too big that theres a tonne of competition\n\nyour unit economics need to stack up against the tam in your example lets say theres a pool of 1m people that would pay 30 twice a year to try a new tech toy your tam is 60m\n\nthis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 3050 of the market\n\nso lets look at unit economics required to win millions of customers  eg youd be getting 60 per customer per year but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer\u00a0you probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers whats it cost to get your ad in front of a million people\n\nand then how long do they stay a customer eg what is the ltv\n\nwe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework youre in the low importance low frequency box this is the worst box to be in\n\nso its a small tam high cost of customer acquisition high churn \u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions\n\nso would i get hung up on tam no but if the tam is small you want the other factors to be good if everything is bad then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea\ndepending on what stage of the startup youre on tams can work however the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if youre revenue model makes sense and youre able to show low acquisition costs high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real tam assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe som however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular  its really the calculation of what if any the series a will look like\n\nat early stage 1 should get you something stupid like 1 in revenue if they are asking for 1m seed to hit 1m in revenue you have a series a candidate if their som is something bigger like 100m and all they need is 5 m preseed but the dont have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their som is 1m but need 2m to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nthe tam for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\ncltv and cac are probably a much more telling exercise than the tam sam som\n\nbtw nearly 90 of our nos are based on our assessment of a weak founding team 9 of our nos are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand call back when you get some 1 may include the tam discussion posited in the post\nneed to know tam as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale easier to be a 100m company with a tam of 100b than a tam of 200m\n\nbut in reality tam is very easy to manipulate and enlarge if you are airbnb you may have picked the private bb market as your tam but the expand to private shortterm rentals and tam is much bigger then expand into hotels and its huge now go global\n\nto me a tam is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything\n\ni am working on an ai  human chat serviceplatform i am broadening the focus to service support and sales that expands potential market significantly then adding a human layer likely means i can also cater to enterprise so from smb to large enterprise i am actually too broad and need to sort this out but tam is helpful","100":"whats new in ecommerce \ud83d\udd25 week of oct 21st 2024 hi rshopifyecommerce  im paul and i follow the ecommerce industry closely for my shopifreaks ecommerce newsletter every week for the past three years ive posted a summary recap of the weeks top stories on this subreddit which i cover in depth with sources in the full edition lets dive in to this weeks top ecommerce news\n\nstat of the week 75 of viral songs on tiktok started with a paid creator marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower count\n\nthe ftc adopted a click to cancel rule last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before renewing subscriptions or converting free trials into paid memberships additionally businesses will be banned from forcing customers to go through a chatbot or agent to cancel subscriptions that were originally signed up to using an app or website and memberships signed up to in person must now offer the ability to terminate them by phone or online \n\ngoogle is giving its shopping platform a major overhaul with the help of ai the

improve your business openstore built opendesk to support its own customer service needs across the 40 ecommerce brands it operates and now its opening the tool up to other companies\n\npermira

and poshmark messaged users indicating that it is rethinking its new fee structure \n\netsy sent out a notice informing sellers that moving forward shippo and shipstation will be the only thirdparty shipping services to be offered on the website this means that other providers like pirate ship easyship and shippingeasy will no longer be offered as an integration theres since been much confusion around what this notice actually means pirate ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an email and that they were unclear whether customers that require reauthorization to their connections in the future would be able to continue using pirate ship they later said they are confident that they will but its all a little blurry right now as to what to expect with shipping partners and etsy \n\n1worldsync released its fourth annual consumer product content benchmark report featuring insights collected from 1750 shoppers across the us and canada a few highlights from the report include 15 indicated that they are shopping on d2c sites more than in 2023 compared to 21 who are using d2c sites less which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces 49 of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews 31 of shoppers now use chatgpt google gemini or other ai assistants to help inform their choices up from 22 last year however consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking just 35 said they found ai tools to be accurate often or always\n\nthe uk government is set to introduce regulations on bnpl products aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices a consultation on the draft legislation began on oct 17th and will remain open until nov 29th with legislation expected to follow based on the feedback the proposed regulation aims to enforce affordability checks clear disclosures and protections under the consumer duty aligning bnpl with existing credit card rules much like what the us recently did the government would offer a transition period for bnpl companies to catch up to speed to avoid disruptions in the market\n\nmeanwhile in the usa the financial technology association filed a lawsuit challenging the cfpbs new rule on bnpl products saying that the rule oversteps legal bounds in may the cfpb ruled that bnpl vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender fta president and ceo penny lee said unfortunately the cfpbs rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts oversteps legal bounds and risks creating confusion for consumers the cfpb is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of payinfour bnpl products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures in excess of its statutory authority and in an unreasonable manner\n\nformer amazon

ever since the industrial revolution and mass production  we have increasingly been getting used to the idea of disposability single use plastic use and throw tissues indeed any capitalist society thrives on how quickly obsolete things can become so that new things can be bought to take their place now extend this idea to all facets of the human experience namely the entire system of objects and our relationships we can categorise  from things to socialfamilial institutions to ideas to places and of course to ourselves\nwe are living in an age of disposability situationships are disposable relationships selfies are disposable photographs if you dont like one take another people often claim that this is a generation of authenticity i disagree this is a generation of curated authenticity keep trying to be authentic till you get it just right\nthere is a dc supervillain called clay face he can change his looks and demeanour at will far from being a gift this is depicted as a curse in having the ability to become temporarily everyone he truly is permanently no one a disposable identity one might say\nthere was a time when for better or worse identity was defined by the circumstances of ones birth a blacksmiths son would be a blacksmith a tanners child would be a tanner and a priests child would be a priest i will not get into the intersectionality and issues of gender as a basis for identity to keep this discuss on point\nbut capitalism gave rise to the need for mobility and geographical mobility also necessitated social mobility our identity was not defined by where we came from but rather what we did and what we did allowed us to buy brands so as the traditional notions of identity fell away we started identifying ourselves then by conspicuous consumption someone who could afford expensive stuff was richer and rich people were rich because as capitalism assumed they were more productive and therefore of more use to society\nbut now conspicuous consumption is democratised access and accessibility both have been solved for in this era we define ourselves not by conspicuous consumption but by conspicuous production and all we produce today is disposable so our basis for identity today is conspicuous disposable production  content selfies latest trends knowledge streaming selfies 10 minute deliveries \nit is no wonder then that our lives are also increasingly getting verbified\nwe fetishise action of any sort  we dont eat food we are foodies we dont watch moves we binge watch we dont buy we blinkit brand names are also becoming verbs where once was polo now there is munch where once was horlicks now there is boost\nwe blinkit orders\nwe swiggy food\nuber is a great example of such conspicuous disposability one time driver no wonder then that most industries now are getting uberised\nbut one shall watch this trend with great wariness for truth is i wonder when nature decides we are a disposable species and accordingly does dispose of us\n  ronexindia requires all individuals to have a flair before postingcommenting\n\nplease familiarize yourself with rules before proceeding further the subreddit is

read the manifesto of unabomber \nits quite similar to this\nremoved\n1 the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race they have greatly increased the lifeexpectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries but they have destabilized society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities have led to widespread psychological suffering in the third world to physical suffering as well and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world the continued development of technology will worsen the situation it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in advanced countries\n\n2 the industrialtechnological system may survive or it may break down if it survives it may eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine furthermore if the system survives the consequences will be inevitable there is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy\n\n3 if the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful but the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later\n\n4 we therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system this revolution may or may not make use of violence it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades we cant predict any of that but we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society this is not to be a political revolution its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society\n\n5 in this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrialtechnological system other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether this does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant for practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say for example since there are welldeveloped environmental and wilderness movements we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature even though we consider these to be highly important\n\nthe psychology of modern leftism\n\n6 almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general\n\n7 but what is leftism during the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist when we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists collectivists politically correct types feminists gay and disability activists animal rights activists and the like but not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist what we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type or rather a collection of related types thus what we mean by leftism will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology also see paragraphs 227230\n\n8 even so our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish but there doesnt seem to be any remedy for this all we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism we by no means claim to be telling the whole truth about leftist psychology also our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only we leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries\n\n9 the two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call feelings of inferiority and oversocialization feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism but this segment is highly influential","115":"kapiva testofuel shilajit whey protein hi

that our episode would air on march 29th the season finale however on the 28th they said our pitch was shelved with no explanation\n\nthis news was devastating based on the confirmation email we had shipped nearly rs 15 crore worth of ice cream to warehouses and stores across the country perishable products with a shelf life of just 34 months\n\nsince then ive relentlessly tried contacting the shark tank team they didnt respond to even one of my 14 emails in the past month weve even secured a no objection certificate noc from bahubali film producer shobu yarlagadda addressing any themerelated concerns\n\nmy requests are simple air the pitch or feature it in the unseen pitches segment on youtube as done in previous seasons out of 150 pitchers im the only one fateful\n\nfrustrated were desperately trying to liquidate the stock through bulk offers and partnerships with blinkit instamart and zepto but for a small brand moving rs 15 crore worth of ice cream quickly is a huge challenge\n\nwe built our business on a foundation of trust and transparency the same is expected from a platform like shark tank india all i seek is a resolution  air the pitch or acknowledge our efforts its should be gone viral on twitter and linkedin then its possible","129":"arata blinkit confusion can anyone explain why deepi couldnt invest in arata  he is tilting on the side of being extremely ethical or he had another reason to reject it but gave this one technically anything can be listed on blinkit so he shouldnt be investing in anything \namazon sells all

with swiggy and zomato \n\n2 instamart delivery fee tends to be higher than blinkit as well a lot of times not always \n\n3 instamart changes final billorder on the app this has happened to me and my friends we placed order for x received y checked app and app showed that order was placed for y not x after this happened a couple times we started to take screenshots asap after placing order it happened again but this time we had proof complained but nothing happened this was 23 months back \n\nplease note that i havent faced this problem in last 23 months  that also maybe because i havent used instamart a lot in these months\n\nthats all please take this as my opinion check for yourself when making purchases  \n\nhope this helps in some way   this thread is flaired as serious

fastdelivery app india which has focused on the packaging a lot and it works it amplified that good feeling once i received the product as expected i am someone who considers functionality over aesthetics and would rate an app 5 on 5 if the serviceproduct as they claimin terms of quality or convenience but blinkit experience was different than this opinion\n\ni would appreciate if everyone can share their opinion on this how do you think packaging is crucial in ux or is it just a compensation of poor product\n\nthanks i dont really understand what youre asking but ruxdesign is mostly software focused\n\nif you want to learn about packaging design youll have better luck in the graphic design subs","132":"blinkit is the worst  had a horrible experience with blinkit   rotten products

for the whole month i have asked women who sell eggs to keep 6 for me every day so i can get them when i come its become a routine for me now and i get a discount on eggs now\nyes online shopping and

of this sub ill turn 18 in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here 1 ncr has better infra in terms of road size metro etc  mumbai is catching up on that  \n\n2 your experience or impression is bound to change once you live there for few years outside hostel  i used to cross iitb everyday once upon a time for few years \ud83d\ude05\n\n2 given how ncr and mumbai have been built it is tendency to like one city and not the other but not both  opinion is split normally \n\nfor me if someone can take care of my housing in mumbai i will shift there tonight\ni have lived in many cities in india \n\nof course delhi then jaipur mumbai kolkata bhubaneswar pune bangalore these are the cities where is spent at least 6 months ot more many other cities where i spent less time so not mentioning them \n\ngurgaon at least the one on this side of the highway  which excludes the old gurgaon is a very very competitive urban agglomeration vs others in india \n\ni think ahmedabad and hyderabad may be better and mumbai and bangalore in parts \n\nbut overall gurgaon has all the elements of urban living  good school great hospitals good shopping scene restaurants communities are now coming up through huddle etc the career opportunities is what makes it stand out in north india \n\nyes it doesnt have a cultural fingerprint as it is a primarily immigrant settled city but i think with time it will find it its only 20 years old if we are being fair 30 max lets give it another 2 decades \n\nnoida is just too sterile delhi is too big \n\ngurgaon has good balance of everything \n\nmy own thoughts and i know people will have strong opinions but thats ok\nill just pick one aspect of what you said south indian food bombay has a much much larger diaspora of south indians and in gurgaon is close to none as a south indian who was born and raised in bangalore and living in gurgaon since the past 2 years now the south indian food from naivedyam or sagar ratna is not even close to south indian food \n\ni think you just like the taste of south indian food made by these mainstream restaurants\neveryone likes where they were born and brought up theres always a soft spot for the homeland kiddo \n\ni lived 19 years of my life in nepal kathmandu moved to india for uni and job its been 8 years and yet i miss kathmandu and the food there equally how i used to miss em in my initial days comin here not only the food i miss everything actually\nin my experience people are better there doesnt have a showoff culture and place is much secure you dont love a city because of malls food aur 10 min delivery you love a place for the people around you","143":"dmart user tries zepto  \nive been an investor in dmart since 2017 and have also been buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later","144":"just another rant about this wicked city  what is this city mannow haters will all try to go against me like who am i to say how is this city and all but trust me it is way too fcked than anyone can ever imagine renaming can never change any of its downfall man  this city is developing downwards fs  half the places on google maps are not even registered  5070 of people are uncultured and too conservative and old style as if its early 2000s thats going on no sign of proper modernisation and forget about night life  its been a year i came in here and all i realised is this city is best for killing your social life  no friends no social life  no dating and what not  which on the contrary destroys my mental peace and yea this is to be blamed to this city indeed  i mean see the condition of city buses  auto man charges kidney level prices for just 200300m ahead of some chowk drop point and what not i mean this city is more costly to stay and live in than nearest metro cities atleast there are cheap public transport services well maintained food and delivery systems and what not  and what i get here is either pay way to extreme than imagination for quality life and food or just for urself with whatever tf u have i mean i literally thought being a semiurban city could be a really good and developing one but since covid what i have noticed is this city is getting fcked and fcked over which makes me wonder the situation of it post 23 years from now  all chappris taking over and what not my life feels hell here without any friends in college  no social life and wasting all this money here for better lifestyle which makes me feel i mean why am i even alive like tf dude  kuch nahi chalta yaha na blinkit hai  na zero broker hai  na like basic things for a normal lifestyle hai  i see and talk with my old friends who settled in metro cities and look at their life and compare it with mine and realise like wtf did i even do to be here feels like my sins are making me pay too much for my life and man idk life sucks here fs i lost hopes for high school romance and now for college romance as well  romance kya bc yaha pe toh dost hi na bante mere cuz im not a localite na isliye ye kaisa bhed bhav hai i mean itne kaise backward ho sakte bhai  thode standards toh chahiye na like tf dude  i feel so bad for myself  i mean even im blaming the city  its my fault ik and i seek nothing but salvation and also reddit community is dead here not just reddit any kind of way of communicating and finding friends here online is dead here fs so yea thanks for reading my  useless for u  rant cuz yaha pe logo ko alag ghamand hai ki this city is  than world but lauda kuch nahi hai hua toh bhi ek prozone mall and cannought place ke alawa kuch nai bruh    bro bashing his head on concrete wall and neither hoping for a waterfall to emerge\ntbh cannaught bhi chhapri ho gaya hai\ud83d\ude36\ud83c\udf2b\nidhar hum log chai sutte pe vibe karte hai and our night life is our dhabas with great food and best of the times with our buddies we are actually living a rich life by spending time with our loved family  friends instead of hustling for materialistic things like nightlife and great shopping  malls we go to punemumbai etc once in a while if you try to be a part of us you will know what we people are rather than ranting here baaki whatever you listed is problem of whole india its you who have failed to make friends here with all the dildaar people here just try to be a good friend of a aurangabad aka chsambhajinagarkar and see what love and warmth is baaki itna problem hai toh you can anyway leave for any other city\n\ni kinda like the city being away from the hustle the whole city feels like home no rush  and beautiful \nit is enough modern and enough developed for you to give a good standard of living now it is completely on you to choose the circle you are in in your case looks like you have quite a pathetic circle of friends and i would suggest you to join some music instrument class where you can surround yourself with the good quality of people also choose good places where you are eating and even reflect on how you are treating the people around because people reciprocate the behaviour that you show towards them and if you are very adamant that you are not the part of the city and hate it well not everybody likes to be around a bitter person \n\nhoping youll eventually find your comfort in this city and be content with what it has to offer\nbro you are in college and still cant make friendsthats wierdcollege me dost banane bhi nhi padtesidha ban jantemaybe you are

paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is

for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved here was because i was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents\n\nand i dont regret one bit\n\nlike i said\n\nthe heart of our people is something i love things are just slow in bhubaneswar i personally actually like it\nlaughed out loud on the first con of bhonsor shit is so real\ni shifted from mumbai to bhubaneswar and i dont feel like settling anywhere\n\ni avoid jaydev vihar and beyond areas like patia due to traffic\nthats it\n\nbhonsor is very peaceful and slow you save so so much\ni was born and brought up in bhubaneswar been living in bangalore for almost 12 years now and have left bbsr almost 19 years back frankly apart from weather bbsr is a place i would always want to stay i miss my school and college days congrats and enjoy

buy whey protein  the problem is i am quite skeptical  about the brands and their quality i have 2 questions\n\n which protein can i take as a begginner a friend suggested on but on researching i got to know it has many copies circulating around and chances are you will most probably end up with a fake one\n\ni thought of buying one from my gym trainer but still got some trust issues so is blinkitzepto ok or shall i prefer the website of the og protein brand only\n\nbhai samajh hee nahi aa raha kiska protein le kaha se le\ud83d\udc80 check trustified youtube channel he does the independent lab tests for all whey proteins\nsearch google  twitter for liverdoc and whey protein research  results  he had done extensive lab tests to determine what are the actual ingredients and which brands whey protein is closest to its claim  you will get good idea from there\n\nedit  the link  \nas it is whey atom 2kg costed me around 3500 from healthkart  i would recommend buying from healthkart only you can buy muscleblaze as well  but dnt ever think of buying big muscles\nmuscleblaze biozyme has worked well for me it has lab test reports from lab door and they have testing kit which you can buy and test their protein\nas safe guard against copy go for uncommon flavours like vanilla or badam shake mango etc copy makers only copy popular and easy selling flavours like chocolate\nget muscle blaze basic protein from store or healthkartcom its quite clean and since youre buying directly from the company nakli hone ka sawal nahi doesnt hurt your pocket either","147":"blinkit has now opened its print store in kochi  now i dont have to get scammed to idiot shopkeepers charge 15rs a paper \ud83d\ude2d\nthis is awesome have never owned a printer due to

protein rice and long cut roasted vermicelli \nis there anything i should be keeping in mind apart from quality checks  good packaging for now \ni have to start building social media around this and i am planning to sell via quick commerce like blinkit bigbasket instamart etc \nany one who can help me with growth of the brand organically \n\nps  this is my first startup and i plan to make it successful as i am bootstrapped by myself and my savings \n\nany input would be greatly appreciated thanks  i was going through your responses and realised you were keen on going heavy on social media this is a common strategy for d2c brands in a crowded space however there will be competitors with deep pockets due to external funding which can turn out to be in your favour let me explain\n\ni have recently shifted from corporate to start my own independent agency and through that i have consulted a few d2c brands that were recently funded the one thing every founder is eager to do is run paid ads \n\ni have seen good ideas turn into a disaster because founders marketed their products too early   \n  \nthus if you can identify your niche take your time to really understand your customer and create a targeted plan for reaching that customer slowly but surely you can achieve success  \n  \nbut the journey will be long and you will have to grind in silence an often overlooked thing is that founders who receive funding are often put into the limelight which acts as a motivational factor at times it takes greater courage and determination to build something in silence and keep improving every day\n\nmy close friend built a 100 million dollar saas company completely bootstrapped and it took him 4 excruciatingly long years of grinding but it was worth it for him\n\nmy team has been asking me to create a pdf on the topic the ultimate d2c ecommerce checklist before you start paid marketing maybe i can dm it to you once its ready\n\nall the best to you and i hope you can make it\ncheck dm\nyeah quick commerce is the best way \nyeah quick commerce is the best way \ni have a question regarding your startup is this not already too crowded what is the differentiator in your

prevent the nail polish from chipping i dont usually apply clear top coats\n\nfor matte polish apply a single coat on the weekends and reapply a single coat when it chips throughout the week thats the

chicken local butcher or apps like zepto blinkit liscious etc on the basis of quality price and any other metrics that may be necessary\n\n\n2 i would prefer to buy from a local butcher because im trying to curb reliance over apps supporting local yada yada in this case what do i say to the butcher i dont want to sound completely clueless what cut size weight etc to ask for how to ensure safety and quality standards are being met and how to know if im being fooled or ripped off\n\n\n3 i mostly plan to buy a bulk quantity that can be safely preserved in the freezer and can be thawed and cooked as needed over 45 days is this even feasible what quantity can i buy and freeze for the maximum possible duration such that it doesnt go bad\n\n\n4 how to tell if the chicken is undercooked is the pinkishness the only way any tips and tricks to not undercook or overcook the chicken or is it only learnt by experience \n\n\n5 what are the easiest and quickest ways to cook chicken i dont think a curry would be possible on week days because of a hectic schedule im mainly thinking chicken soup or small peices on tawa would i have to buy an air fryer for this \n\n\n6 are there any other

cost effective you can even make a deal with them if you buy regularly \n2 make sure its an alive chicken they are butchering for quality if you are eating everyday you can have 150 gm of chickencalculate your protein req and remove other protein sources problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces instead get 500 gm of chicken breast i guess there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm ask them not to chop it chicken breast is a good source of lean protein\n\n3 its feasible if you use freezer go for 500 gm in the beginning adjust it as you go\n\n4 this is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked a always cook on low flame b use non stick panatleast in the beginning and

it might be a bit too early to call this my favourite i know but it smells so damn good to me \nopening kind of spicy with the main note of cardamomelaichi this doesnt last very long though\ndry down rich and syntheticbut in the best way possible ultra fine refreshing leather \ndefinitely not something i can use daily but i love it\n\n3 some random attar clone of tobacco intense from this company called kannauj perfumes\n i got it for 200 rs in a stall they set up in my apartment a few weeks back ive not smelt the original so im not sure how well they copy it but by itself its great value for money cant really smell any tobacco but its sweet and fresh also performace is pretty good\n\n4 salvatore ferragamo bright leather\ngot this off of zepto on a big discount for 34k opening is citrusy and fruity with grapefruit dry down is musky and has a very soft and smooth leather fragrance very pleasant not at all overpowering and strong like noir en leather\n\n5 jaguar classic black\nmy daily go to got it for 24k on blinkitzeptoi dont remembervery generic and mass pleasing cant really put my hand on what notes it uses but its fresh and has a slightly spicy tinge great summer frag but can be used all year round moderate performance the bottle is so dishevelled because i keep it in my bag for school everyday\n\n6 ajmal silver shade \ni use it sometimes when i get bored of jaguar got it for 12k on zepto fresh citrusy and metallic cant go wrong with this also ive heard its a clone of creeds silver mountain water but idk how far thats true performance is decent same as jaguar classic black \n\n7 decant of beardo whiskey smoke\nfriend gave this to me for free spicy winter frag pretty mid tho dont use it much nothing else to say here\n\n8 villain edp\nthis was my very first perfume i got in 2022 i used to love this and i finished a whole bottle of it within a year sweet dark and fresh smelling but this new bottle just isnt as strong and performace sucks barely lasts 30 minutes idk if they changed its formulation or what its just not the same anymore the only reason its even this high is because of nostalgia \n\n9 adidas ice dive\ngot gifted this by my cousins smell is pretty decent fresh citrusy and sporty wouldve been ranked way higher if it performed barely lasts 1 hour and forget abt projection\n\n10 ustra scuba cologne\nthis is the only fragrance in my

whole card \n\nthe trust factor is pretty low on a zomato branded card now and it would take a whole lot of efforts to bring the same back\nicici should get it as it doesnt have many good cobranded

in hydrabad im sharing my thoughts on pros and cons am from the north shifted from delhi ncr last year\n\ncons  \n1 little to no weekend getaway options 23 din ki chutti mil jaye get so confused ki kya karein bencho\n2 not a con as suggested correctly by several in comments far away from hometown for people from north have to plan and spend about 50k on travel plans alone by flight or if by train be ready to spend 45 days on travel alone\n3 north indian sweets are less in options those selling dont have the same taste id almost kill for om sweets ki rabri rasmalai the best desi sweet of all times period\n4 the traffic is a nightmare but its similar to gurgaon if not worse also brings it to a standstill after heavy rains more of an indian metro issue than just hyd\n5 never faced any water issues in the whole north india here specially the new city area hitech city was a barren land so come peak summers very significant water problem have to completely rely on water tankers which adds up to rent costs\n6 gated society flat rent and buy rates are eye watering much high than delhi nsr but there is also a positive mentioned in pros below\n7 ola and uber demand far exceeds the supply and forget uber or ola money never put balance in it instead keep upi handy every damn auto or bike guy has a qr code ready with them or keep cash but upi is of course more convenient you have to have at least a 2wheeler for your convenience peak hours mein its a pain to get an auto or even a bike public transport is very bad old rickety lopsided buses\n8 flouting traffic rules is the past time of hyderabad go to old hyderabad and you will see more people without helmets than with i used to be pissed off at every wrong side no helmet rider but have learned to be more careful and patient myself and accept this lawlessness lol\n\npros  \n1 the weather is hot till may then it starts raining cats and dogs from june so no heat till next year march cant imagine a single night without ac in june or july in the north\n2 a heaven for foodies the non veg kind specially the biryani the curries and the andhra cuisine is excellent\n3 tha cafe and restaurant options are unlimited and varied the cafe culture is excellent you can go to a local cafe and enjoy talking with your friends for hours imagine a more accessible and unpretentious starbucks experience in almost any residential locality \n4 local bakeries are very nice have a good sale so the produce is fresh i have stopped ordering bread from blinkit\n5 the dhinchak dakhini hindi dialect is commonly used and the assholery like bangalore is not here yes forcing others to learn a language unless they themselves feel the need due to issues in communicating by abusing northerners in an auto cab or anywhere outside is plain assholery in my book so you can easily live here if you know hindi\n6 you can wear whatever the fuck you want 365 days a year i have seen fully burka clad and short skirt wearing ladees in my office and have purposefully tried to see if any men are leering at the skirt wali grills honestly out of 10 only 1 or 2 stare which is saying a lot compared to the way majority would rpe with eyes in delhi ncr \n7 you can eat whatever whenever the fuck you want no closing of meat selling businesses for whole weeks or months people hindus and muslims both will come on street if there is any ban on buying or selling any kind of food we love our food and the freedom to eat it\n8 politically they hate bjp and congress equally hate congress because majority hyderabadis being brs fanbois and congress won from the semi urban and rural telangana and have heard big electricity cuts in several places in hyd since they came to power bjp because they see whats happening in the north and dont want it to happen in hyderabad\n9 very safe city girls can roam around in late evening without fear of eve teasing or worse\n10 it is also a pretty clean city not in the leagues of indore chandigarh etc but much cleaner than the whole delhi ncr\n11 i said gated society rent and buy rates are eye watering but people majorly live in standalone building with ease this is because of bare minimum crime rates one can live with family in a standalone building with peace of mind cant even think of the same in gurgaon\n\nall in all this is honestly the countrys best metro right now i plan to settle completely have my kids assimilate into the culture learn telugu my kids and i and become native hydra baddies asap im a hyderabadi and have lived in gurgaon briefly the relative comparison looks on point except that for sweets do explore a bit more in hyderabad \n\nthat aside youve covered other aspects accurately in terms of comparison\nbruh 2 really i mean you made the choice of coming here its like me going to us and saying india is far hardly a con\n\n3 i dont think sweets are less in option dadus have pretty good sweets and haldirams and bikanerwale are franchise which is present in north as well maybe not the better than delhi but does a good job coming close shouldnt be an issue per say \n\nalso there is a lot of place you can go for the weekend there are many resorts could go to warangal karnoolvizag if its a long weekend \n\nother than these you are pretty apt just that its pov of someone from hi tech city area hyderabad is much more than the it area the rent and all reduces in secunderabad area by a lot\nbro kudos to you for analyzing the city so well that too just in year i agree with all the pros and disagree with few cons\nfor sweetsdesserts go and try below\nrabadirasmalai  mahalakshmi in kachiguda\nif you are a kaju barfi fan go to balaji ratanlal kachighda\nseethafal malai or any other authentic malai desserts go to milan fruit center

regular 15 reward rate despite spending specifically on flipkart grocery i even doublechecked the merchant name on my flipkart axis and axis ace statementit clearly shows flipkart grocery for the grocery transactions but for hsbc the merchant name is flipkart\n\nthis is frustrating because a significant chunk of my grocery purchases will continue to be on flipkart as their prices often match if not beat dmart if i cant get the 10 cashback on flipkart grocery transactions i may have to rely on my flipkart axis card for the 5 cashback or go for an instant bank discount if available making a

leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery company zomato announced an initiative food rescue to limit food wastage because of canceled orders\n\nright after zomatos cofounder deepinder goyal tweeted the new initiative on social media a bengalurubased product manager suggested potential improvements on twitter for the feature to prevent misuse\n\nthe man named bhanu proposed that zomatos food rescue option should exclude cashondelivery orders and advised a restriction whereby customers would not be able to cancel orders if the delivery partner was within a 500metre radius of their location\n\nhe opined that customers can misuse the discounts where two users could order and cancel meals concurrently to purposely take the discounted prices further the bengaluru man recommended that zomato limit the number of cancellations permitted to each customer capping it at two per day to prevent people from misusing the current feature\n\nthoroughly impressed the zomato boss responded directly to bhanus post saying that these suggestions among others had already been incorporated into the feature goyal praised bhanus good thinking and inquired about bhanus background expressing the desire to work together in the future\n\nwho are you and what do you do the zomato cofounder wrote would love to know you more and see if we can work together\n\nbhanu replied that he is a product manager based in bengaluru working for a startup he also said that he often shares feedback to improve services on social media particularly tagging zomatos sister company blinkit \n\nincidentally with zomatos new feature food rescue canceled orders will appear on the app for customers within 3 kilometers of the delivery partner carrying the order to maintain the quality and freshness of the food the option will remain open only for a short time  just a pr stunt\nbut when ola the exploder founder mrbhavish did this everybody and their mamma got \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udca2\nthose were such

deliveries by choosing a time slot and both the times the order was delayed by more than 24hrs today as well one of my rush delivery was delayed and i contacted amazon i later learnt that all these so

approach\n\n1the best way it works that you know someone inside the company like you know someone from hal or zomato or apsarapencil maker\n\n2 the company should have multiple customers so that it is

cost of production is too high in a country that offers protein bars for 20 and chips packets for 10 at retail points you cannot grow a business in this segment unless youre creating a legacy brand

in india and its market post 1 link \n\n\n\nso yesterday i tried to do it in a home freezer just to try it with flavours textures and feel of a frozen fruit\n\ni got kiwi and dragon fruit\n\ni cut them into beautiful small cubes added 4 flavours \n\n1 dairy milk chocolate which i melted and put few drops over the cube \n2 honey\n3 red chillies and salt\n4 lime \n\nand put them into freezer \n\nafter few hours i tried them the one with dairy milk was awesome i liked honey one too \n\nchilies were too much and lime was there or not i have no clue because kiwi was sour maybe off season or something\n\noverall noted few things \n\n1 you cant eat frozen fruit directly it just like an ice cream difference is you lick ice cream most of the time or its creamy but fruit is like an ice cube it was hard have to give some time to eat after putting them out of freezer\n\n2 so i got some 20 pieces overall because i wanted to get taste test done from my family members and as we were eating and discussing they started to melt again weather problem india is too hot and humid \n\n3 add on flavours started to melt away as well\n\n4 although fruit was able to maintain there texture and taste plus point so it does increase shelf life if done properly\n\n5 cutting a fruit properly to maintain equal size is difficult and time consuming and as well it creates wastage \n\n6 dragon fruit is a f tasteless fruit not the first time eating it i am having it since childhood and kiwi is moslty sour \n\nit doesnt mean i am giving up on the idea i will do some more rd and with basic fruit as well kiwi and dragon fruit is kinda expensive as well not widely available or likeable fruit in india \n\ni ordered frozen strawberry too it was available on blinkit and it was tasteless i love strawberries i eat them a lot but it was hard to consume it was more suitable for smoothie or as toppings thats why most brand do only berries as frozen fruit \n\ni will try again with the sample in few weeks with full research this time and preparation and hopefully come up with crazy combos and ways to make it more flavourful and easy to bite \n\nif you have any suggestions or ideas or a roast or anything would love to hear them out \n\nthank you for the time  how about smoothie pre mixes\njust buy and blend it all to drink it\u00a0\n\nyou can experiment a lot with it\u00a0\nyou can target high protein frozen smoothie mix vegan smoothie experiment with different flavors etc etc\n\nbut they cant just buy from supermarket then go back home and blend it asap to drink it right that is just not a good product\n\nwhat if you can install a small machine where they can just fit the cup and it blends it right then and there and now they can enjoy an on the go healthy snack\n\ni for sure would buy it if i am out because i dont really like eating outside food and prefer something organic\n\nnot sure about majority indians\nsomething you like doesnt mean that whole market will like it try all your final products to your family and friend circle its food taste not code so reddit wont help much in terms of real feedback\nthe world has generally gone the other way  ex fruits like nutsraisins inside chocolate\n\nif you want to be truly unique go triple layer cream inside fruit inside chocolate\nseen first post and now secondtry more mainstream i would say\nhave you given a thought to inject the flavour \n\nlike if i could inject my apple with honey or inject watermelon with masala water\n\ni know for now these are fairy tales but hey even i havent tried it yet soi hope

point theyre a fully fledged dropshipper like boat noise boult audio at this point with a 1000 employee team either way it is a very shitty business with a very small barrier to entry if these people stop marketing their products theyre unlikely to beat unilever with their game with brands such as lakm\u00e8 sunsilk glow  lovely glow  handsome clinic plus ponds clear and others\n\noutside of unilever theres lor\u00e8al maybelline vlcc and emami who can generate far better profitability and brand recall and inhouse cosmetics and rd spend on introducing new products\n\nmamaearth is like micromaxkarbonlava of cosmetics industry the point is that it is not very difficult for very large companies with big capital such as amazon or reliance to copy and replicate the same kind of noname low cost product using one of their many private label brands such as amazon basics solimo etc\nmamaearth is a garbage company with equally shitty products if you make subpar products you wont last in the market why would i buy 3rd grade products when so many better alternatives are available for any cosmetic brand if you dont have repeat customers you will become extinct and they absolutely deserve it\nthe profit they showed last year was less than the discount they got from amazon\n\ni really dont understand how mamaearth be called a start up or why would an individual buy its share\n\nthey really dont have anything new or niche \nanywhere good luck to them and their individual investors\nhow can quick commerce be competition they sell through thay channel\n\nblinkit or instamast do not have their own product in same category\n\nbaby care and dermat is overall very crowded space and they do not have anything unique compared to competition so i doubt it will get any better\n\nthey are expensive for tier 2 and tier 3 cities so strategy of expanding may not help\n\ndirect selling through website is where they should focus with better discounts thats the only way of

also refused to give me number since there was language barrier between us my friend was talking to him in his language while i was just standing there listening in the end he refused to corporate and we both end up being frustrated and he told me to order multiple things and cancel it so after i orderd they all came and ask to cancel it since i just did 5 fake orders my friend was the only one who was talking and they made false claim against me that am talking trash about south indians and all and just messing with them so after i canceled it it was all ok untill 1 guy came and he said there r

come but my friend still came with me after we talked to manager the manager said its all ok just dont do this again and so i oppologize and said sorry the another manager also called me and told that u can message us then why u did it i said that there was no option about this product and he said that u could also complain on other product about this product issue then that guy called me a bit far from that shop and told me to pay 10k for wasting there time and talking bad about south indian so they took my phone and and recorded me and my friend and told that i said bad about south indian and did fake order just to mess with them\n\nthen since they were in group and all we kept saying sorry then they ask what job we do so i wqs just studying and looking for job so i said studen they asked

marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower count\n\nthe ftc adopted a click to cancel rule last week which requires businesses to make it just as easy to cancel a subscription as it was to sign up for it and get consent from customers before

the only thirdparty shipping services to be offered on the website this means that other providers like pirate ship easyship and shippingeasy will no longer be offered as an integration theres since been much confusion around what this notice actually means pirate ship was caught off guard by the unexpected news and sent customers an email and that they were unclear whether customers that require

expect with shipping partners and etsy \n\n1worldsync released its fourth annual consumer product content benchmark report featuring insights collected from 1750 shoppers across the us and canada a few highlights from the report include 15 indicated that they are shopping on d2c sites more than in 2023 compared to 21 who are using d2c sites less which likely means they are shopping on more marketplaces 49 of shoppers said they leave product detail pages that have too few customer ratings and reviews 31 of shoppers now use chatgpt google gemini or other ai assistants to help inform their choices up from 22 last year however consumer confidence in these tools is still lacking just 35 said they found ai tools to be accurate often or always\n\nthe uk government is set to introduce regulations on bnpl products aiming to protect consumers and promote responsible lending practices a consultation on the draft legislation began on oct 17th and will remain open until nov 29th with

credit card rules much like what the us recently did the government would offer a transition period for bnpl companies to catch up to speed to avoid disruptions in the market\n\nmeanwhile in the usa the financial technology association filed a lawsuit challenging the cfpbs new rule on bnpl products saying that the rule oversteps legal bounds in may the cfpb ruled that bnpl vendors are classified as credit card providers and must provide the same legal protections and rights to consumers as conventional cards such as the right to dispute charges and demand a refund from the lender fta president and ceo penny lee said unfortunately the cfpbs rushed interpretative rule falls short on multiple counts oversteps legal bounds and risks creating confusion for consumers the cfpb is seeking to fundamentally change the regulatory treatment of payinfour bnpl products without adhering to required rulemaking procedures in excess of its statutory authority and in an unreasonable manner\n\nformer amazon employee\u00a0stephanie ramos\u00a0shared the reasons\u00a0why she quit amazon just 11 weeks after rejoining the company which she previously worked at for six years the

user first makes a request for products a request is made to the product availability service the product availability service takes the location of user as parameter using the user location the product availability service then calls the nearby delivery centre service to check what are all the delivery centres near to the user this nearby dc service is attached to a redis which holds the mapping of delivery centre to a location segment  \ni opted for redis for the purpose of fast retrieval of information and also it will only be used for read only purpose since the location of a delivery centre is always going to be constant and also redis has support for geospatial index which makes proximity search possible\n\nusing user location the nearby dc service makes a call to the 3rd party mapping service to find out which location segment the user belongs to and what are all the segments that are near to the user segment  \nonce the nearby dc service has the list of nearby segments it then gets the delivery centres belonging to those segments from redis and forwards this to product availability service which then queries the product inventory service to check for the availability of products  \nall these available products are then forwarded to the user for them to order  \nonce the user places the order the order is placed via request order service the request order service forwards the request to order service to place an order and make an entry into the db the order service queries the inventory service to check the available qty and decrease the count\n\nthe request order service also sends a request to the delivery partner service to identify a delivery partner that is near to the delivery centre  warehouse from where the products are supposed to be collected the delivery partner then queries delivery partner location service to find out which delivery partners are near the location of the delivery centre warehouse this flow is similar to how we find delivery centres nearby a user\n\nonce the order is delivered by the delivery partner the order delivery status is sent via delivery partner location service to kafka there is a order delivery status consumer that fetches the delivery status sends it to order service which then updates the status or order  \ntalking about the location of delivery partner the delivery partner sends the latest location pings to delivery partner location service the dp location service then queries 3rd party mapping service to identfy the location segment the delivery partner belongs to and

aspect to assess before you invest your money and time in a venture in the unknown but sometimes you come across an idea that seems very niche yet in the grand scheme of things it can be a brilliant productservice users probably dont know they needed it but they do if its executed correctly\n\ni have been building a peertopeer rental marketplace for tech enthusiasts who are looking forward to trying out new gadgets on the market for pennies for example renting the apple vision pro a very bad decision for someone who would have bought it since its not a very refined product for a day for just 3040 usdsorry for the dumbed down explanation \n\nand i have been told that its a very limited market with not so many growth opportunities especially in the indian market because indian users are very different from those in the usa or european countries first its a trust deficit market people here believe in ownership although the population might look very huge if you look at the tam based on monetary value its a very small chunk less than 05 of the population but still a huge number and growing every day\n\nand finally my assessment is if there is no way to avail this service how would users know that it can be done quick commerce 10minute grocery delivery seemed to be a very absurd idea in the indian market because people have a connection with their kirana store grocery store owners and in every street you can find multiple stores yet its a billiondollar industry now and growing rapidly because there is a huge behavioral shift people are leaving homes and shifting to highly dense areas operations limited to a few cities with high target population and availing credit has become easier than anything so one thing leads to another and its shaping an industry that still looks very absurd   however one of the many companies in the market blinkit alone is valued at 13 billion usd and threatening the business of giants like amazon and flipkart \n\nim a firsttime founder and encountered this problem myself back in 2019 during my junior year when i needed a camera for a project and couldnt find the one i wanted so i came up with this idea but it took five years to finally execute it we now have a few users on version 10 of our mvp the biggest challenge so far has been operating in a highly trustdeficit market and sometimes it feels like im working on a vetting company more than a p2p rental marketplace we have learned so much in building it so far that i believe if this doesnt work the byproduct will surely provide me with an exit opportunity\n\nplease share your thoughts or concerns \n\nthank you for reading  in general i hate the tam discussion because vcs use it to kill investment right away its an easylogical no from them \n\nin reality its a double edged sword airbnb and uber both started with tiny tams and found ways to grow into massive businesses cocacola expanded their tam once they started to view themselves as a fnb company not just a soda company \n\nbut its hard to build a big business with a nonexistent tam you should run some numberswhat is a reasonable som obtainable market how big can that business be \n\nthen you need a story on how youll expand into a larger tam\nunderstanding your tam is important as is your unit economics\u00a0\n\ndo you want to build a startup as opposed to just starting a business where you dont need to raise capital and dont intend to hire more than a handful of people\n\nif you want to build a startup your tam needs to be big enough to hit the scale stage but not too big that theres a tonne of competition\n\nyour unit economics need to stack up against the tam in your example lets say theres a pool of 1m people that would pay 30 twice a year to try a new tech toy your tam is 60m\n\nthis is big enough for a small startup if you could see a way to get to 3050 of the market\n\nso lets look at unit economics required to win millions of customers  eg youd be getting 60 per customer per year but what do you need to spend to acquire each customer\u00a0you probably need a million people to see the ad to get 1000 customers whats it cost to get your ad in front of a million people\n\nand then how long do they stay a customer eg what is the ltv\n\nwe can guess churn will be very high because in the needs framework youre in the low importance low frequency box this is the worst box to be in\n\nso its a small tam high cost of customer acquisition high churn \u00a0kinda the worst possible set of conditions\n\nso would i get hung up on tam no but if the tam is small you want the other factors to be good if everything is bad then back to the drawing board to see if you can come up with a way to change one of the factors or pick a different idea\ndepending on what stage of the startup youre on tams can work however the reality is that you can only decide if something is working if youre revenue model makes sense and youre able to show low acquisition costs high retention and large lifetime revenues\nwe like to see someone do a real tam assessment and understand the thinking to see if they understand what business they are in\n\nthe som however is where seed and preseed investors are very particular  its really the calculation of what if any the series a will look like\n\nat early stage 1 should get you something stupid like 1 in revenue if they are asking for 1m seed to hit 1m in revenue you have a series a candidate if their som is something bigger like 100m and all they need is 5 m preseed but the dont have a plan you are not going to put money into them or their som is 1m but need 2m to get their you have to understand when they will start building decent unit costs\n\nthe tam for early stage is just an exercise to understand the business acumen of the founder or founding team\n\ncltv and cac are probably a much more telling exercise than the tam sam som\n\nbtw nearly 90 of our nos are based on our assessment of a weak founding team 9 of our nos are based on our assessment of no immediate market demand call back when you get some 1 may include the tam discussion posited in the post\nneed to know tam as it shows people the market you are choosing to play in and scale easier to be a 100m company with a tam of 100b than a tam of 200m\n\nbut in reality tam is very easy to manipulate and enlarge if you are airbnb you may have picked the private bb market as your tam but the expand to private shortterm rentals and tam is much bigger then expand into hotels and its huge now go global\n\nto me a tam is more about those early decisions if defining your business and target market more than anything\n\ni am working on an ai  human chat serviceplatform i am broadening the focus to service support and sales that expands potential market significantly then adding a human layer likely means i can also cater to enterprise so from smb to large enterprise i am actually too broad and need to sort this out but tam is helpful"}]],"100":[[{"negative":0.2314783037,"neutral":0.35874632,"positive":0.4097754359,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"whats new in ecommerce \ud83d\udd25 week of oct 21st 2024 hi

marketing campaign according to one major label marketers estimates however theres currently no way to track exactly how many songs go viral organically or because they are boosted by thousands of dollars worth of paid promo captioning a video with ad or similar disclosure is required by the ftc when creators receive compensation or free gifts in exchange for a post but that same standard has never been set for the promotion of a song some larger creators fetch over 10000 to use a song in one of their videos while smaller creators can receive as little as 25 depending on their follower

authenticity keep trying to be authentic till you get it just right\nthere is a dc supervillain called clay face he can change his looks and demeanour at will far from being a gift this is depicted as a curse in having the ability to become temporarily everyone he truly is permanently no one a disposable identity one might say\nthere was a time when for better or worse identity was defined by the circumstances of ones birth a blacksmiths son would be a blacksmith a tanners child would be a tanner and a priests child would be a priest i will not get into the intersectionality and issues of gender as a basis for identity to keep this discuss on point\nbut capitalism gave rise to the need for mobility and geographical mobility also necessitated social mobility our identity was not defined by where we came from but rather what we did and what we did allowed us to buy brands so as the traditional notions of identity fell away we started identifying ourselves then by conspicuous consumption someone who could afford expensive stuff was richer and rich people were rich because as capitalism assumed they were more productive and therefore of more use to society\nbut now conspicuous consumption is democratised access and accessibility both have been solved for in this era we define ourselves not by conspicuous consumption but by conspicuous production and all we produce today is disposable so our basis for identity today is conspicuous disposable production  content selfies latest trends knowledge streaming selfies 10 minute deliveries \nit is no wonder then

read the manifesto of unabomber \nits quite similar to this\nremoved\n1 the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race they have greatly increased the lifeexpectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries but they have destabilized society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities have led to widespread psychological suffering in the third world to physical suffering as well and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world the continued development of technology will worsen the situation it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in advanced countries\n\n2 the industrialtechnological system may survive or it may break down if it survives it may eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine furthermore if the system survives the consequences will be inevitable there is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy\n\n3 if the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful but the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later\n\n4 we therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system this revolution may or may not make use of violence it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades we cant predict any of that but we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society this is not to be a political revolution its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society\n\n5 in this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrialtechnological system other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether this does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant for practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say for example since there are welldeveloped environmental and wilderness movements we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature even though we consider these to be highly important\n\nthe psychology of modern leftism\n\n6 almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general\n\n7 but what is leftism during the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist when we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists collectivists politically correct types feminists gay and disability activists animal rights activists and the like but not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist what we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type or rather a collection of related types thus what we mean by leftism will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology also see paragraphs 227230\n\n8 even so our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish but there doesnt seem to be any remedy for this all we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism we by no means claim to be telling the whole truth about leftist psychology also our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only we leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries\n\n9 the two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call feelings of inferiority and oversocialization feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism but this segment is highly influential"}]],"115":[[{"negative":0.008680786,"neutral":0.8909752965,"positive":0.1003439873,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"kapiva testofuel shilajit whey protein hi all\ni came across kapiva testofuel

younger members of this sub ill turn 18 in about 2 months but i have been living in gurgaon since my birth just 5 months ago i went to mumbai for my btech in powai iitb and let me tell you everything other than the air quality is better here the food in not just the mess but most of the restaurants i have tried is so much worse regardless of the cuisine even south indian dishes taste so much better here in places like sagar ratna and naivedyam i have been to the biggest malls there namely phoenix and r city both of them pale in comparison to ambience airia and even ardee mall in terms of variety of brands and restaurants it was honestly a huge shock to me considering i had heard that mumbai is the best city  the fact services like blinkit and zepto deliver within minutes here and always take about an hour there was also something i did not expect   apart from the air quality gurgaon mogs mumbai in every other measurable aspect  truly blessed to have been raised here 1 ncr has better infra in terms of road size metro etc  mumbai is catching up on that  \n\n2 your experience or impression is bound to change once you live there for few years outside hostel  i used to cross iitb everyday once upon a time for few years \ud83d\ude05\n\n2 given how ncr and mumbai have been built it is tendency to like one city and not the other but not both  opinion is split normally \n\nfor me if someone can take care of my housing in mumbai i will shift there tonight\ni have lived in many cities in india \n\nof course delhi then jaipur mumbai kolkata bhubaneswar pune bangalore these are the cities where is spent at least 6 months ot more many other cities where i spent less time so not mentioning them \n\ngurgaon at least the one on this side of the highway  which excludes the old gurgaon is a very very competitive urban agglomeration vs others in india \n\ni think ahmedabad and hyderabad may be better and mumbai and bangalore in parts \n\nbut overall gurgaon has all the elements of urban living  good school great hospitals good shopping scene restaurants communities are now coming up through huddle etc the career opportunities is what makes it stand out in north india \n\nyes it doesnt have a cultural fingerprint as it is a primarily immigrant settled city but i think with time it will find it its only 20 years old if we are being fair 30 max lets give it another 2 decades \n\nnoida is just too sterile delhi is too big \n\ngurgaon has good balance of everything \n\nmy own thoughts and i know people will have strong opinions but thats ok\nill just pick one aspect of what you said south indian food bombay has a much much larger diaspora of south indians and in gurgaon is close to none as a south indian who was born and raised in bangalore and living in gurgaon since the past 2 years now the south indian food from naivedyam or sagar ratna is not even close to south indian food \n\ni think you just like the taste of south indian food made by these mainstream restaurants\neveryone likes where they were born and brought up theres always a soft spot for the homeland kiddo \n\ni lived 19 years of my life in nepal kathmandu moved to india for uni and job its been 8 years and yet i miss kathmandu and the food there equally how i used to miss em in my initial days comin here not only the food i miss everything actually\nin my experience people are better there doesnt have a showoff culture and place is much secure you dont love a city because of malls food aur 10 min delivery you love a place for the people around

buying groceries from dmart for many years to ensure we stay selfsustainable \ud83d\ude02 i tried zepto today just to see how it works and whether it will really impact dmart in the long run here are my two cents\n\n1 experience with zepto it was really good and fast and cheaper due to coupons but not when compared to dmarts prices\n\n2 will i buy from zepto again  \n   sure i will who doesnt want a few quick deals in the name of a discount\n\n3 will i continue investing in dmart or invest more  \n   yes i will until quick commerce burns vc capital ill stay invested once the business model is proven to fail dmart will likely boom\n\nhow long can vcs burn cash on quick commerce to create this disruption  \nonly until the ipo or six months after the ipo due to the lockin period\n\n\nupdates\n\nmost people who support quick commerce often cite the following points to defend blinkit\n\nusability of the application\n\n\n1 once people become accustomed to an app they are unlikely to switch even in the absence of discounts\n\nin my view this isnt entirely true at least in india\nfor example\n\n recent news highlighted how jio and airtel lost a significant number of customers to bsnl due to price hikes\n\n how many of us stick to just one quick commerce app isnt it common to compare prices between swiggy and zomato before ordering food\n\n\n2 the elite crowd prioritizes convenience over price\n\nagain im unsure how long this will hold true the same elite crowd often shops at stores like zudio and westside for the instore experience rather than relying on online platforms like myntra or amazon\n\n1 personally i used to buy meat from an online app for several years however after receiving stale meat once i switched to buying meat directly from shops these shops not only offer better quality but are also cheaper than the online options\n\n\none alarming trend is the willingness of people to pay a pricetoearnings pe ratio of over 315 for zomatoa tech company with a profit of just 250 croreswhile being hesitant to invest in dmart which has a profit exceeding 650 crores and a much lower pe of 87\n\nin my opinion the sustainability of quick commerce heavily depends on cheap labor however how long this cheap labor can sustain is a question only time can answer until then i believe both quick commerce and brickandmortar retail will coexist and failure for quick commerce seems more likely than brick and mortar  good analysis zepto and blinkit is good only for convenience after burning the vc capital there would be no more discounts than only dmart would be able to provide at mrp or below mrp purely due to its scale and margins quick commerce can never provide below mrp without vc capital\nokay \na few points zepto and any other quickcommerce platform for that matter uses the vc money to figure out the following \n1 dark store penetration and expansion in areas where dark stores arent profitable ie minimum order value on a daily basis thats where the vc money handle the loss\n2 the tech costs of app and the staff running the company and optimzing the algorithms \n3 cost of delivery \n4 marketing and ads to promote the platform but most brand films are in collaboration with brands so a part is paid by other brands\n\nthey do not pay for the discounts not one cent\n\nthere are some exceptions where they wish to grow the category  but usually they dont \n\ni have worked in kam roles in multiple brands the model is simple if i have a product a whos mrp is say 100 rs \ni pay zepto a fix margin so 30 norm its higher for blinkit so they pay me only 70rs so i they sell it to a consumer for 100rs they keep 30 and give me 70 \n\nso take case of discounts they put it for say 80rs so instead of 100 they get 80 from the buyer so they balance it 10080  20 they raise a debit note agaisnt it and the brand has to pay it back\n\nnot only that the banners the placement on top of search for keyword search everything is monetized \n\nso zeptos net profit is  margin from brands30avg  banners and marketing placements  cost of dark stores and delivery tech cost  any marketing ads and extra coupons\n\nso the critical part is increasing the former and decreasing the latter blinkit have managed it by keeping margin highs new brands are asked for as high as 55 and using the learnings from zomato to optimize the delivery costs also to note they go more for guerilla marketing than high cost brand films keeping the marketing costs for the low\n\nhave to point some coupons are the zeptos initiative to increase conversions but most discounts are borne at the source\nquick commerce is made for the growing riches in india while india will continue to have the middle class and more importantly more and more people getting out of poverty to middle class dmart and zepto both are not going anywere i think only if the real growth story happens to be a success and not just gpd growth\npeople used to say same stuff about online cab aggregators look where we are now food for thought\nhow tf are people still underestimating quick commerce with exponential growth in last 2 years brosky india has infinite cheap labour itll become profitable sooner or later"}]],"144":[[{"negative":0.829940021,"neutral":0.0322952643,"positive":0.1377647072,"aspect":"blinkit","text":"just another rant about this wicked

no social life  no dating and what not  which on the contrary destroys my mental peace and yea this is to be blamed to this city indeed  i mean see the condition of city buses  auto man charges kidney level prices for just 200300m ahead of some chowk drop point and what not i mean this city is more costly to stay and live in than nearest metro cities atleast there are cheap public transport services well maintained food and delivery systems and what not  and what i get here is either pay way to extreme than imagination for quality life and food or just for urself with whatever tf u have i mean i literally thought being a semiurban city could be a really good and developing one but since covid what i have noticed is this city is getting fcked and fcked over which makes me wonder the situation of it post 23 years from now  all chappris taking over and what not my life feels hell here without any friends in college  no social life and wasting all this money here for better lifestyle which makes me feel i mean why am i even alive like tf dude  kuch nahi chalta yaha na blinkit hai  na zero broker hai  na like basic things for a normal lifestyle hai  i see and talk with my

you do the same\n2 you see successful people there and that helps you work harder too\n3 you get a better pay over there\n4 the weather is \u2764\n5 the language problem is not as bad as they show in social media \n\ncons of living in bangalore\n1 the city kind of lost its heart you dont get too many people ready to help you hardly speak to your neighbours or even co workers\n2 too many ways to lose money whether its the convenience of zepto blinkit or the expensive goods over there you end up paying too much for things and comfort\n3 the quality of water and food is not as great\n4 traffic is \u274c\n5 some spots where you see the language problems it definitely feels like the city is moving backwards \n\nbut bhubaneswar is a different vibe altogether \n\npros\n1 the heart i never lived in bhubaneswar my hometown is in keonjhar the can driver that picked me from airport arranged for a plumber an electrician and a carpenter for the house for no reason at all\n2 the price of basic commodities in bangalore my per day expenses would be 1500 for the family this includes food groceries petrol etc here i spend less than 500 for me and my wife things are way cheaper here\n3 closer to home and helps me visit my parents more frequently than before\n4 everyone knows odia its so much easier to communicate \n5 the food people here have no idea how rare authentic odia food is in other states\n\ncons\n1 every service provider carpenter plumber etc delays their project for no reason the ac installation guys came late 12pm ish after promising 9 am took a break in middle went on a 3 hour long lunch break and then installed the rest\n2 the weather is so much more humid its hotter here irritating between 10 am to 4 pm i just have to adjust to this\n3 not a lot of dog friendly areas its rare here \n\n\nthats about it\n\ni tried to be as objective as possible\n\nthe reason i moved here was because i was missing home too much and feeling guilty that i was not available for my parents\n\nand i dont regret one bit\n\nlike i said\n\nthe heart of our people is something i love things are just slow in bhubaneswar i personally actually like it\nlaughed out loud on the first con of bhonsor shit is so real\ni shifted from mumbai to bhubaneswar and i dont feel like settling anywhere\n\ni avoid jaydev vihar and beyond areas like patia due to traffic\nthats it\n\nbhonsor is very peaceful and slow you save so so much\ni was born and brought up in bhubaneswar been living in bangalore for almost 12 years now and have left bbsr almost 19 years back frankly apart from weather bbsr is a place i would always want to stay i miss my school and college days congrats and enjoy dahi bara aloo dum\nwhat about financial transition  what difference you face in pay

really understand your customer and create a targeted plan for reaching that customer slowly but surely you can achieve success  \n  \nbut the journey will be long and you will have to grind in silence an often overlooked thing is that founders who receive funding are often put into the limelight which acts as a motivational factor at times it takes greater courage and determination to build something in silence and keep improving every day\n\nmy close friend built a 100 million dollar saas company completely bootstrapped and it took him 4 excruciatingly long years of grinding but it was worth it for him\n\nmy team has been asking me to create a pdf on the topic the ultimate d2c ecommerce checklist before you start paid marketing maybe i can dm it to you once its ready\n\nall the best to you and i hope you can make it\ncheck dm\nyeah quick commerce is the best way \nyeah quick commerce is the best way \ni have a question regarding your startup is this not already too crowded what

other gender queer folks im planning to incorporate chicken into my diet mainly to up my protein intake but ive never handled it in the kitchen before ive eaten it in restaurants though so mainly my

may be necessary\n\n\n2 i would prefer to buy from a local butcher because im trying to curb reliance over apps supporting local yada yada in this case what do i say to the butcher i dont want to sound completely clueless what cut size weight etc to ask for how to ensure safety and quality standards are being met and how to know if im being fooled or ripped off\n\n\n3 i mostly plan to buy a bulk quantity that can be safely preserved in the freezer and can be thawed and cooked as needed over 45 days is this even feasible what quantity can i buy and freeze for the maximum possible duration such that it doesnt go bad\n\n\n4 how to tell if the chicken is undercooked is the pinkishness the only way any tips and tricks to not undercook or overcook the chicken or is it only learnt by experience \n\n\n5 what are the easiest and quickest ways to cook chicken i dont think a curry would be possible on week days because of a hectic schedule im mainly thinking chicken soup or small peices on tawa would i have to buy an air fryer for this \n\n\n6 are there any other important things that im missing that i need to take care of when working with chicken \n\n\napologies for the

breast thighs wings or pieces into different categories but butcher shop can be cost effective you can even make a deal with them if you buy regularly \n2 make sure its an alive chicken they are butchering for quality if you are eating everyday you can have 150 gm of chickencalculate your protein req and remove other protein sources problem will be that 150gm of chicken from butcher shop will yield you only chopped pieces instead get 500 gm of chicken breast i guess there will be two breast pieces for 500 gm ask them not to chop it chicken breast is a good source of lean protein\n\n3 its feasible if you use freezer go for 500 gm in the beginning adjust it as you go\n\n4 this is a bit tricky when it comes to chicken breast because it can usually get rubbery and dry if overcooked a always cook on low flame b use non stick panatleast in the beginning and make sure to close it with the lid while cooking trust me it makes all the difference c i make chicken tandoori and the marinade makes it soft d when its juicy and glazed with far you know your chicken is ready but dont cook it more than 20 minutes i always use a tbsp of ghee\nchicken legs and wings are easier to cook
